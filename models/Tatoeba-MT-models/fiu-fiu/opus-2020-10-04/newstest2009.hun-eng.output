The Prague stock exchange has reached the end of trade minus
The Prague stock exchange corrected its losses after the morning crash.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Company (ČEZ) reached nearly half of the usual daily trade.
The Prague stock exchange continued its downfall from the beginning of Tuesday’s trade, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time there's a fall in Wall Street's stocks.
We too have the market response to the result of the vote of the American Parliament, which rejected support for the stabilisation plan of the financial sector there.
Loss of shares in Asia
On the Asian stock exchange, the dramatic fall of the shares was experienced on Tuesday, although the indicators during the day some of the losses were eventually deleted.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock exchange index describes almost four percent during the course of trade, but later some of the losses were deleted and reduced to approximately 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong stock exchange, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index observed Chinese shares fell by 3.8 per cent, and the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The stock exchange shares in Sydney lost more than five percent, but the losses eventually decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwani stock exchange has fallen by 3.6 per cent according to the index there.
"The timing of the American rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," notes Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong financial council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, defines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American lawmakers should start the negotiations again immediately, and they should accept the proposal for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it is a threat that other countries will feel the consequences of this.
The blood bath of American stocks
On Monday, the U.S. Parliament rejected the draft support for the financial system to which $700 billion (approximately $12 billion) should have been translated.
The lawmakers have therefore ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks had a blood bath and the leading stock indices recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, a similar fall last time in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as it turns out that the proposal was not accepted in the Parliament, the index began to fall free.
Congress has withdrawn: US government can pump $700 billion into banks.
The main leaders of the United States Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed to provide financial assistance to the American financial system in the broader form of the agreement.
They will vote on this in the beginning of next week.
American lawmakers have been breaking through negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the American financial system of $700 billion (approximately $12 billion).
But there's no victory yet.
The Congress must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can disclose the final form and vote of the law.
The draft support for the financial system will be discussed at the Parliament on Monday.
He informed the Reuters news agency on Sunday by Barney Frank, President of the Committee of Financial Organisations.
According to Senate's sources, the draft is likely to be voted on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, it should be announced that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, it will then be "resolved".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've taken a great step.
We have solved different views on the form of a market stabilisation package," mentioned the Bloomberg Agency, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat.
He says the final vote may take place on Sunday.
The representatives of the law were meeting with Henry Paulson, the American Minister of Finance on Saturday night to give the Government Fund a final form.
This should purchase unsafe mortgages from financial companies, which bring financial firms into serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are connected to the final agreement on a draft that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
The corrective draft needs to be continued, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets that are weak.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the lawmakers are therefore trying to reach an agreement at Congress on Sundays.
Therefore, they want to reassure investors before trading on the Asian financial markets, where the decision of the Congress could first be influenced by the trade in Monday.
However, it is still not clear that the two chambers of the United States Congress when they vote on the law, as it does, whether the trial can't happen at the last moment because of a problem.
The lawmakers hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush's request, the first $ 350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress may block the issue of the remaining amount, which was set at USD 100 billion and USD 350 billion later, if it feels that the programme does not perform its function.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations
Although the President may deny this decision, the Congress may, however, overreact.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme was the acquisition of financial assets for buying bad mortgage securities that lost their value, since hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay mortgage loans.
"We've developed everything.
The Parliament should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress made in the negotiations is also satisfied by President Bush.
Tony Fratto, spokesman of Bush, stated that the President is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates the "two-party efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of buse ends
Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Banking Committee of Senate, conducting the negotiations, said that the lawmakers agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the benefits and the timing of the draft financing.
The new law also limits the end-of-of-business of directors involved in the programme and establishes a Board of Supervisors.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked hard on this, and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also counts on the help of the household owners who have problems with the repayment.
In the case of mortgages purchased by the government, new debit shares should be created with a view to reducing the monthly debit shares of debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Help for life
The proposed draft is a good idea for David Marek, the director of Patria Finance, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"It's all because you can't know what mechanism and price problems you're going to buy.
This will be determining how the financial sector and the government share the losses," said Marek to iHNed.cz website this week.
Marek says it's not so important that the plan is approved at the beginning of the next week.
"The more important thing is that the Congress has already decided this week to support the plan, and as soon as possible, they will bless them.
The spiritual importance of reaching agreement on the approval of the plan is the most important thing at this moment," stressed Marek.
Couple battle blade: MP3 Players v. Mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost all mobile files are able to play MP3 files, no MP3 players can call.
That makes it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
However, there are many reasons for getting a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the way it is used and on the needs of the future owner.
It's probably hard to get a high-quality expensive record player at home to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on bakelit discs, but in a quality perspective there are no objective reasons for this.
However, if helcai are full of art rock, jazz or blues, he is probably dreaming of such a record player.
It is similar to the intended travel, i.e. compressed - simplified by MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
Some people can be unacceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player as a Pink Floyd fan is probably hard to accept a 20-century market earphone.
Two extremisms between which everyone has enough room.
There's a wide selection.
The lifetime of the elements also counts
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply playing music, but they can also do much more by accident.
None of these devices are as universal as the phone.
You can play music and videos alongside the primary features, telephone and texting, and you can play both, pick up a better and worse camera, and you can even navigate.
And if we take account of smartphones and communications, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no television can photograph.
The multi-functional cell phones are also detrimental.
The more functions you use on the mobile, the more the display sends it to the charger.
And the music play is one of the biggest energy meters.
Little mobile devices can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, mostly it's much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more effective.
The cheap cell phones should count that they won't play for you for more than a few hours.
Even if you're on the phone here and there, get a charger for your workplace for safety, it also applies to the more expensive devices.
There will be no such problem for MP3 players, even worse people will be able to operate at least 9 hours continuously with one upload.
The next problem arises when you download music to your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB cap and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only few card readers can handle miniature memory cards using mobiles without an adapter.
For players, some exceptions (iPod) do not need any special software.
Enough to upload the device from the computer with music through USB.
The majority of mobiles and players are already creating a music library that has been set up by the rapporteur, the album, the genre, or, for example, according to the user's assessment.
Some devices describe fastruns just like Windows Explorer, and you know some of them both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
You should be interested in selecting a specific device, in particular, the duration of the battery lifetime, memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output, and of course the comfort of treatment.
If music primarily serves you as a background and listens to you for a short period of time, for example, on the electric, any MP3 playing cell phone is suitable for you.
And that's what any cell phone can do.
You don't have to watch more specifically what music formats your cell phone or player knows.
With MP3, each can cope and the final majority of music you get will be in this format.
The MP3 is among the most widespread and the final majority of the devices are also able to handle the WMA-format music.
AAC (formulation used by Apple and its iPod) is less likely.
Better mobiles also allow online music purchases.
Enough to visit the appropriate pages of the service provider (or other service provider) through the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service can already be a pressing argument for the purchase of musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of service providers is limited to vast and usually only one summer radio camps.
Prices aren't even low.
However, it is generally assumed that music is going to manage such a way of selling (e.g. GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future.
Most people keep their cell phones on their own all the time.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you click your cell phone in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 playout home he's leaking.
However, it depends on whether he always wears earphones or at least the speakers.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker with almost every cell phone but only a few MP3 players.
Many people are likely to have the biggest advantage of musical cell phones.
The cheapest are usually less than three thousand crowns.
You can get a fair walkman between three and four thousand crowns.
However, mostly you are restricted by the lack of output of the traditional ear listener.
The best and most technically equipped phones can be put up to 15,000 crowns with traditional 3.5 mm-diameter earphones.
At the same time, the advantage of players is simple treatment.
With the simplest - in no way necessary to treat the cheapest players (see our choice), everyone is actually able to deal with it.
The minimum function, the treatment comparable to the previously normal tape tape tape or gramofone, is obvious.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of accidentally switched mobile internet, nor in respect of the giant account following data transmission.
What device to choose
The cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually open to the exchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
The buying of the right card also has a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
The basic types only support cards with maximum capacity up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive can do what to do with up to 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and even a cheap MP3 player you want to buy, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
On the basis of capacity (max. 2 GB), it does not need to spend more than 100 kroons.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobile walkers (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, and the comfort of the treatment is thus approaching the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson was the prestigiousest in the sector, which has the same user interface for mobile phones with walkman series as the separately sold MP3 players.
The MP3 players of the above brands can provide the same service in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (whole 16 GB) and battery life (generally 15 hours and up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will reach Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The Czech mobile market is relatively advanced and our service providers provide practically the same services as their Western European partners.
However, there is something missing here - the virtual service provider that forces classical service providers to significantly reduce prices.
Maybe it won't be long.
On Mobile.cz website, we have often written that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This has been confirmed by the ČTO, which has pointed out that the cost of texting in the Czech Republic is more expensive than the other countries of the Union.
Following the last step of the European Commission, roaming charges may thus have a contradictory situation - Czech mobile operators are going to be cheaper than nationals for some customers from abroad.
How can prices in Czech Republic be so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, I miss the competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory because we have three mobile networks and our penetration is highly over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are pleased to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often agreed by Mr Dvořák, the Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Office, who has said a few times that there is no place for another service provider in Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic service provider is no longer likely to have too many chances on its own network (although it is probably hard to find frequency).
But there is another possibility - the virtual service provider.
It was precisely the move of virtual service providers to the mobile market that led to a significant decrease in prices, which the classic service providers had to respond to.
In the meantime, even before the big fish were placed on the market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virginia Mobile in Great Britain, there were voices similar to ours.
However, it has proven that such providers have a place and can indeed succeed.
However, we do not have to go too far for an example.
This February we informed you about the launch of the Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider has managed to obtain more than 100 000 customers in not only six months and become the fifth largest service provider there.
In the meantime, the Penta Financial Group is behind Mobilking, which is not only the owner of the U:fon in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
For effective operation, much less customers than the traditional service provider need.
It does not entail relatively high costs for construction, mobile network operation and maintenance.
Virtual service providers in the world usually show low costs - cheap calls and text messages, which are often offset by less service.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper texts than its competitors.
But as the example of Poland's Mobilking shows, it can be a pretty good move to adopt a target group.
This service provider focuses specifically on men.
"The real men choose the Mobilking service provider - who they like to trust," says David Seibert, director of Mobil Entertainment Company operating this virtual service provider.
It is hard to tell if the idea of a similar to that of Poland can work with us.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesman, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach based on the majority of virtual service providers.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory for the provision of services."
In Czech Republic, it is impossible to claim mobile providers
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service in Czech, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic, consultations do not seem too hopeful.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, the spokesman of the Penta Financial Group, in his phone interview to Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it has been demonstrated that the existing mobile operators in Czech countries do not have too much contradiction with this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to avoid any potential competition.
The GTS Novera group has been unable to hide its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider for some time, so that Phoneica O2 is a new step to become a real competitor in the field of business customers.
"We are very interested in providing our customers not only wireless, but also mobile telecommunication services.
The sooner the better.
This option has been repeatedly negotiated with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the group spokesman.
Maybe it's a better time.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual service provider can be lucky by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by the wall of improper silence.
"In this moment, we do not think that a full-value virtual service provider would be a place on the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very special.
So far, we have not been called by an unambiguous subject offering complex and serious projects in this area," said Mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, Telefónica 02 press division.
The other service providers also refer to the specific situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, the spokesman of T-Mobile, in agreement with O2, adds: "We have not registered any viable and bilaterally advantageous business projects to which we could be further based."
And he added: "The T-Mobile network at the end of the year is unlikely to appear by any virtual service provider.
At this moment, there should be a specific agreement on our table so that we can think in such a short term."
Vodafone focuses on meeting its own 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are now in negotiations with potential virtual service providers, particularly in the area of the distribution of costs and infrastructure.
It's exactly what we think is the most affordable for our clients.
Vodafone's main strategy is partnership in this area to develop networks shared to the fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - a steam with service providers
Mobile service providers' procedures are easy to understand, entering another service provider would lead to an increase in competition, a fall in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why should we facilitate the entry of such a competition?
When there is something important for service providers, they can cooperate, they also testify to the wozavona around the birth of U:fon.
The biggest pressure on ČTÚ is likely to have been troubled about the birth of the U:Fax of the T-Mobile company.
This is the publicly available information on the ČTÚ website.
But right now, the U:fon comes as a good reason for not letting the virtual service enter.
Mr Kemrová added: "The environment for the competitiveness of the mobile market has recently been influenced by access to the market of the fourth mobile service provider.
In view of the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is clear that a new player's entry into the market and services would be subject to high requirements."
However, given the attitude of mobile service providers, the total negligence of the Czech regulatory bodies is quite incredible.
In the meantime, it is not only about ČTÚ's attitude, which, unfortunately, in Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no right to intervene in economic competition.
This is the exclusive right of the Competition Office.
However, the agency is characteristic of the whole problem.
"The introduction to the mobile market of the virtual service provider would only be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded since the offer of potential interested parties is probably not sufficiently interesting to traditional service providers," he said to our question about the external relations department of Kristián Chlapua, the Economic Competition Office.
A statement made by the representatives of the service providers is probably not surprising anyone.
However, from the agency that should represent the interests of consumers and also to ensure that no one is able to recover its market situation, this is more than odd.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a country where virtual service providers usually work, we can observe that their move to market has contributed to the reduction in the price of mobile services."
However, it is likely that the interests of UHS do not include pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and on the reduction of prices.
In this case, there is indeed shocking coherence that appears to be quite affecting from the reaction of the three mobile operators.
The question is, is it really just a coincidence, it almost makes sense to itself.
As in the charge stations, the total gas prices are probably just the works of accident and hard competition.
"The Office has not discovered the signs of the anti-competitive procedure in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers have a leading position, i.e. not having a much greater responsibility for their market conduct.
The tools necessary to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are probably missing as well as the telecoms regulator," mentioned Chalupa.
Presentation of the market leader's situation is one of a number of discussion points.
Obviously there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, based on which telecommunication is the only market in the economic competition perspective.
There is, of course, no Czech service providers in such a market in leading position.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the establishment of a virtual service provider.
And the mobile service provider - relatively logically - has monopoly on his own network.
So in a particular segment it is necessarily dominant.
However, even if this argument were not accepted, the UOHS should have a minimum warning that three mobile operators act in an outstanding way.
In the meantime, complaints from interested parties (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) show that they are facing very similar barriers in the course of negotiations with all service providers.
The transfer of responsibility to ČTÚ is a relatively common trick in telecommunication with which the UOHS takes his hand from the whole case.
We've seen this before in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunication Act, the extension of ČTÚ's powers in the field of economic competition has not been carried through in telecommunication, although many experts were hoping to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UHS need to know this well, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one listens
At the same time, some types of false-virtual service providers, of which many of them already operate in Czech mobile networks, remain ignorant.
They are companies that publish their own mobile service price lists, but they are only partially public.
Because it's multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company performs as a classic corporate client against the service provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
You will then receive special price offers (and other discounts) as a selected client.
The problem is that all the commercial conditions of the Czech mobile service providers prohibit similar acquisitions.
"If there were cases that you were talking about, it could be a breach of contractual conditions that we would deal with and which could lead to the completion of cooperation with the company concerned," Martina Kemrová answered our question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that news about this type of activity would not have reached the responsible people of mobile operators.
Firstly, for the three companies mentioned, there are thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider is defending such a procedure.
They have no negligible profits from the activities of these companies, and at the same time, they are not particularly threatened by their own official marketing, unlike the true virtual providers.
Miroslav Čepický warns the potential problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however, only a small percentage of these companies use the services of their customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card is not in their name on their phones, so they must not have it in full as the general customers of mobile operators."
But that's exactly what the ČTO should do.
In addition, there is another question for the UHS.
If mobile service providers look beyond a similar procedure, why are they preventing the birth of the virtual service provider?
It should be added that UHS has a relatively strong right to uncover such activities, and if it does not want, it does not have to be satisfied with the service providers' explanation that there is no such thing as to be said and that it is prohibited by commercial conditions.
When we're not the most expensive
As has been mentioned a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers to the mobile market has led to a noticeable reduction in the prices of services.
In the meantime, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers were created, classic service providers tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, possibly too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in developing countries, at these moments, regulatory authorities have intervened, which, in no way, protected the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Then, either by formal measures or by informal pressure, the first virtual service was created, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators give the whole case to each other.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unevident competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider will really appear soon, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If one of the providers would allow the establishment of a virtual mobile service provider, the UOHS would be difficult to remain indifferent to the rejection of further interested parties (discriminatory).
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be making calls more expensive.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four processing of the Czech state's new versions.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolának presented the new films of the State of the Czech State on the day where my country is?
The band of the National Theatre fixed the mosquito with the leadership of Jiří Bělohlavs.
Four versions are available - male or female soloists, singer or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are singing.
The authors of the change of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz website.
Bělohlabs consider the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He has already told the Czech Radio that he has deliberately chosen young singers with representative voices that are expressing and popular to sing solo variations.
"Although from the beginning, I have tried to ensure that both of them, and later at the orchestra are clean, understandable and coherence of the text," he said.
The Czech state celebration will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song where my country is? was first quieted in 1834 in Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka, complementing the music of František Škroup.
It became popular, and people were spontaneously viewed as their own.
After the 1918 Czechoslovakia became a natural part of the state's hymn.
Even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, one of the seven state symbols remains.
What's the "new" hymn?
The Prague transport company first delivers a chip card on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, you will write yourself into the history of the Prague Transport Company when the first passenger enters metros, electrics and buses with an electronic coupon in your pocket instead of a paper liner.
The coupon is currently able to obtain about 100 grand who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy 30 days and 90 days and annual coupons (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save their chip cards in the information centres and offices of the Transport Company on the Metro Stations of Muzeum, M. M.stek, Nádraží, Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can be purchased online from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until afternoon hours.
Those who start using the internet trading can ultimately forget the metro stations' publishing windows where they had to regularly go through long lines for the lines so far.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and the Opencard card is also stored on it in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers are available to a bar with trained servers who help interested people buy online and save their purchased coupons," said Martin Opatrný, the project spokesman.
In addition to the library, electronic coupons will be saved to Opencard in the self-service automatics equipped in some halls.
What do these machines look like?
Reds, the ticket managers are reminded, and the passengers may have already noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská subway stations.
"Of course there are five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," he added Opatrný.
The coupon is checked by the automobile instead of the driver.
Management of automatics starting their operation tomorrow is simple.
Enough to insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon leaves itself.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow, not only in the capital, but also in the neighborhood.
So on trains around the city and on buses from 300 to 499, with people travelling mainly to the capital of Central-Czech.
"On trains classified in Prague in integrated transport, fishing trips were provided with card readers to determine the validity of the coupons in the area," explained the control of lines in Filip Drága from the Ropid organization compiling the Praha public transport schedule.
In buses around the city, the card readers at the manager are in the cabinet.
The driver should therefore not only show the chip card, but also place Opencard on the wallet side.
That's how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If, for example, the passenger needs to verify the validity of the coupons, it is easier to ask the driver to do so," he added with Drága.
Passengers who do not travel by buses around the city and will not remember when their coupon is running, can go to self-service machines that save the coupons on cards again.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the device display.
The Sudanes wanted a referendum from the US.
In 1945, the Sudan Germans were requested to join the United States of Sumava.
This is from the letter that is in the collection of the Scientific Library in South Czech Republic.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the American cartridge.
Accordingly, in 1945, some groups of Sudanese Germans came to the President of the United States.
This is also evident from a letter that has been preserved from a private archive that is now kept in the collection of the Scientific Library in South Czech Republic.
In the letter, the Germans in Česky Krumlov ask the President of the United States not to allow the reintroduction of the "šumawai county" to the Czech Republic, which Hitler also took on the basis of the Munich Treaty.
"The situation has been correctly understood and we really want to be sure in the words that the American troops in the German areas will not come as oppressive and enemy, but as a liberator," says the letter, "Embers who wear Šumava's destiny on their hearts" in words.
Since the connection to the Czechoslovakia can give hope to the Germans, allegedly, with the knowledge of the Czech national character, only brutality, mercilessness, non-understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the President of the United States to take over the protectorate over Šumava "for now and forever".
"We cannot believe that, without regard to the opinion of four million people, this area would be considered to us as a foreign country, which will suppress and upset the minority, and would almost nothing contribute to the victory of allies," says the letter.
The reason the authors couldn't sign is the fear of the revenge of "Czech Depressors."
So if the President of the United States were to doubt the opinion of the Shomawa Germans, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the Shomawa county on whether the residents wish to become part of the United States and live under the United States' patronisation.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive in addition to the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians say that it properly describes the expectations of the Sudan Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to assume that they were to be relocated from the country, only few of them recognized the possibility.
Some have expected the United States and the Great Britain to agree on a sort of autonomy for the Sudanes.
Others were confident that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, the Austrian journalist born in České Budějovic.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German in Budějovice during the war.
At the end of the war, when the British captured him and put him into a prison camp in Holshtynsko, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them to Czech.
"They trusted that when they returned home, the Czech language would be good for them," said Chalupa.
According to the German prisoners in Czechoslovakia before the war, no one was counted as being displaced from the country on the basis of the Beneš Decretes.
You're not thinking. You're paying!
The emotional campaign attacks the leaders.
The most expensive action in Czech history for the safety of the roads.
The media campaign that affects emotions would therefore be characterised by the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš ?ebíček's office from this campaign hopes that he will prevent the leaders from acting dangerously behind the government.
The campaign of 150 million will appear on television, on radio, on the movies, on the Internet and on the flyers.
The drivers should be alerted from speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them of their safety belts being sealed in before they leave.
First of all, he wants to address the conscience of young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians and not least the professional leaders.
And what's on the ads?
Feelings, mostly human stories.
The whole campaign's "blood" slogan testifies to that:
You're not thinking. You're paying!
The term "don't think" on the plate is written in large letters.
And there's the word "pay" in his bloodtool.
This must symbolize that a person can pay for a moment's distraction with his life.
The viewers will be "screaming" until 2010.
The Ministry was encouraged by similar campaigns in the English Saxony countries, where drastic images of victims of accidents can be viewed regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The Euro RSCG has produced the advertising spots.
Pull it, let the drivers go.
"The driver's system of 'draw it, let it go' is valid.
"Let them go through the red," for example, saving time.
"Stretch it" is a threat of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
He thinks the driver's attention is less effective.
"If the warning table is fitted, it is likely that it is soon connected to the environment and the leaders do not deal with it," warned Kořan.
Olmert would give back almost all the obsessed areas in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmer, the Chairman of the Interim Israeli Government, spoke of the practical return of all areas in 1967, i.e. the West shore of Jordan, East Jerusalem and Golan Fennsík, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview, published on Monday by Jediot Achronot on a daily basis.
"We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means that almost all, if we don't have to give back all (departed) areas," said Olmer to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we have to give the same percentage of the Palestinian areas because there will be no peace without it," he said.
He acknowledged that any return could include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants to be safe in Jerusalem, and the one who wants not to go through tractors and bulldozers, as happened to one of my best friends, must give up some parts of Jerusalem," said Olmert, referring to two July cities in which some people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution to the "Christian mountain, sacred and historical locations" in the Old Town.
"The one who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty across the city must integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't work," he stressed.
Exit from the Golan Ship
Olmert also gave an opinion on the withdrawal of the Israeli people from Golan-fennsík, which believes that it is an essential condition for the peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not recommend peace with Syria solely on the basis of the exit from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they need to give up so they can get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shita Movement); they must give up the regular support provided to the terroristism of Hamas (Shita Movement), Al-Qaida and Jishad (Shita War) in Iraq," explained the Prime Minister.
Questions after accident: Is passengers unlawful in buses?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk in a distance bus.
With regard to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company, it was raised near Padova, whether passengers and passengers could travel in the bus during the journey.
"If we want strictly and formally to comply with the law, the traveller's activity is contradictory with the law on transport activity," says Karel Hanzelka, the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The driver of a car crossing the bus was likely caused by the death of a 25-year-old passenger last week.
She was sitting next to the driver at that moment, at the least safe place in the bus, even though there were two more places for her.
The bus can crash or suddenly brake at the moment the passenger is serving coffee or offers newspapers.
It is important to see whether the bus has its seat under the licence.
If the bus is not homologized, passengers must be seated.
There are no stationary buses for the Student Agency; as confirmed by Radim Jančura, director of the company, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have tried to find a solution to this Ministry, and first passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have found that passengers can go to a drift during the journey, if they have their own seats," he stated his position.
The law doesn't know the passenger.
"There is no clear legal regulation on the role of a passenger - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation for the carrier prohibits the provision of services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of the driver; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds less clearly the spokesman of Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Mr Pokorný, Director of the Ministry of Transport of Road Vehicle Operations, considers that the law properly deals with the problem.
"Depends on whether the bus has a fixed location in its licence.
And it's over," he says.
Buses may be discriminated against in urban areas where there are stations and seats with maximum speed and higher speeds between cities, and distances without stationary and maximum speed, seats with seat belts.
Like on the plane, the expert says.
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP transport safety expert, does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of passengers on board the bus.
"In the course of continuous progress, there are no dangers, we can compare the situation to the service on the aircraft.
I'm not sure when there's turbulence and the air traveller can smash his head."
"But if the bus were to brake suddenly, of course, his physical laws are valid.
Same as city buses or electrics.
The safety of passengers must be resolved by internal rules by the carrier," he says, and he also believes that the problem has not been solved for the law.
Jančura is ready to stop services
Student Agency offers passenger car services as a single bus driver.
He's working on 200 passengers.
The Director does not consider their occupation to be risky after the accident.
"But as soon as I have the impression that the occupation of passengers is risky, I will end it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers on board.
That would be cost savings," says.
In its vehicles, the lack of passengers was justified by safety interests by the director Alexej Litvin, who operates the trail of flights compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have passengers, we're against this from the start.
Sooner or later, it ends with some kind of fatal injury," she told Týden.cz just a year ago.
An incredible tragedy
For two years, the company’s young passenger company in Pzeň died during a flight in Naples.
The Slovenian truck is likely to be rotating out of the stop bar without using the direction indicator and stopping the bus.
The driver of the bus was suddenly trying to get out with a manoeuvre, but the right front part of the bus hit him.
Jančura refuses to sell two reserved places for resting passengers.
"These places can't be booked in the distances, blocked."
The company wants to sue the head of the truck.
With the reimbursement of the daughter’s family, the agency is not expecting the court’s judgment, but expecting financial compensation from the sinner.
Law-Modification?
In the Far future
In order to clarify the movement of passengers on board the bus could be the law amendment, which has been working for more than a year by the 30-person group of experts of the Ministry of Transport.
"But the group has not obtained any concrete results.
Buses are not so, rather, the point system deals with the maximum allowed speed on the motorway and the mobile use during driving," says Hořín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not respect the activities of passengers, which would essentially threaten the safety of passengers," concludes the speaker Hanzelka with the responsibility of controlling the safety of buses by the police and the employment services.
Düsseldorf hopes go to Frankfurt
The letter written by the WestLB Board to the employees of the bank is not narrowed in the great words.
The merger between the Düsseldorf financial institutions and the Deka-Bank Frankfurt could be created by a "the central capital market organisation of the savings financial group", writes the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a permanently profitable "competence block" into a business like this.
Such a connection could give the final push to further mergers in the region banking sector.
This is a reading when a board of directors intends to prove his ability to act in difficult times.
For the unsecured WestLB bank is still under massive pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervisor, which has recently informed the North-Welshington Government that the deadline for finding a lasting solution is limited.
But for savings counterparties, Deka-Bank and WestLB are well - known about their investment funds for a long time ago, the subject of a kind of connection - part of Frankfurt.
Franz Waas, Head of Deka-Bank, was already informed at the end of August when the semester data were presented that the Bank and a Landstraße Landsbank, such as Helaba or WestLB, had no meaning.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which represents half of the Land Banks and the other half of the savings funds alliances, instructed the Board to continue negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
In this context, capital market business or certain parts of it may be discussed.
However, the negotiations - they're stopping financial circles - have just begun.
The name of Deka-Bank belonging to the major employers of the financial sector in France, with the 3000 employees, is not the first to consolidate the savings fund sector.
In 2003, the Deka Bank seemed to be united with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, this third alliance has become nothing.
The plans were hardly published, the Hessen Province Government spoke against Helaba's interest.
Then the other two banks didn't find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead went to Baden-Württemberg in the Stuttgart Landesbank.
However, again and again, the thought of the relationship between Deka-Bank and county banks has been raised.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, President of the Board of Directors of Helaba, spoke against the plans for mergers with his bank.
It is irrespective of the need for the various banks of the sector to be approached.
Now, after the Bajoran province elections, the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected first.
It's not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure on further fusions is increased, potential partners may be lost slowly.
In southern Germany, only a younger business partner could be, where the financial crisis has so far been much better than the Munich and the Stuttgart banks.
The merger with WestLB was excluded from Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen with a 85% business in Helaba at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB is better off.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, represent only one side of the coin.
The other side raises the question of how the different business models of each bank match each other.
In June Merl stated that the German Conservative and Finance Association has not yet answered the final question of the business model to ensure the future of the Land Banks.
Finally, it can be imagined that WestLB is being cut, which they do not wish to do there on their own.
Thus, the letter of the board there also implies that they are definitely seeking a "full solution".
How this is compatible with the merger of each unit with Deka-Bann is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the weekend of Italy
Elena's the first time, Luca's the third or fourth time.
Now Elena's here as her girlfriend, and so everything's different, says Luca.
Behind them, there's a strong-shaped bearded man next to the Caiser brand five-litre barrel, telling about 200 people who traveled to Oktober paint how deeply they can pull out of his throat.
Elena first found Luca's face and then kisses her.
They're from Bologna to Verona.
From here, bus bus from the Puorta Nuova station departs four buses at 23.45 "destinazione Monaco, festa della" for the destination, arriving expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly held for Italians, in the fourth, only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans have already singing alongside their flag, starting the celebration during the night.
And so loud that it's not for Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, a long, skirt coat and a wide, silver-shirt eyeglasses.
He traveled to Oktoberfest five years ago, only three roads this year.
Overnight, in the day at Oktober painting, home at 22.30 p.m.
The accommodation would only mean unnecessary expenditure, says Marco.
The road costs 75 euros, which includes the welcome Kaiser beer cooked in accordance with the Bajor Beer Cleanliness Act, accident insurance and German-language visits - Marco conducted a German language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are throwing themselves into the night in the direction of Brennero on the highway.
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will sleep.
All right, they'll need their strength.
They're in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many Italian buses take a short break before Munich on the 8th motorway.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half a week according to the plan, there are almost 50 other buses coming from Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is holding another briefing, presenting the military plan.
First, everybody pick up the yellow hat.
On the left side, the letter "Oktober paint" was written by the fracture, alongside Marco's travel office, is "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the beer gates open, run," Marco shouts in the morning.
"Full!" Dealing places in the back of the tent.
"Not ahead, because we're stuck and not sitting on the same pillows every yellow cap, let's spread it in the tent."
The one-litre whistle costs 8.25 euros, screaming Marco.
And don't forget about tips.
"Let the security guards behave you well.
As you leave your seats, they're busy!"
Thirdly, "Be back here at 7:30 tonight."
And now we're headed for Wiesn.
On the way, one man, as a guide, ties yellow hats to the trees, the boards, and even the election poster of one of the great Bajoran peoples.
Prepare to retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the weekend of Italy.
There are no exact figures; there are 50 thousand people who are crossing the Alpokon in the beer trays, they are alleged to arrive at 10 percent of all the visitors from Italy in the weekend.
The Munich Police are reinforced by seven South Tirol police officers, Italian volunteers assist the Bajor Red Cross, which, in its national statistics, has about 200 medical care taken by Italians to take the first place, preventing the Austrians (approximately 80) and the lowest level of drums (approx. 60).
Hofbräu was particularly fond of the Italians.
Nightless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed by the Federal Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück, just last week.
Even fortunately, the politician used the word "visual" and even suggested that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because this is the end of the weekend.
The Munich Munich Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received billions of loans from the German bank consortium to protect itself against market turbulences.
One person who knew the situation told Reuters on Monday that credit support was kicked to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest after the amount of interest.
The money comes partly from private, partly public banks.
In the background, the loss of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, Depfa, the state financed projects, loaned money to long-term projects, and refinanced itself for these very short-term periods - which is now not possible due to the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve decreased by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and its equity ratio fell moderately from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current revenues and net revenues from cash transactions have returned to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, revenues from claims and specified securities, as well as from the liquidation of the target reserves of the loan, fell by more than EUR 70 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues resulting from the repayment of the ex-ex-conversion of the Depfa Group and the reimbursement of the taxable interest rates and transactions to companies to the consortium had a relatively moderate income deficit of 16% on wheels.
The former state financer speculated first with company real estate loans after privatisation in 1990, which were subsequently separated from Aeral Bank.
Since the classic state funding was limited, Depfa has increased its involvement in infrastructure projects and in joint projects between private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and has expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate must now carry out descriptions that have a "significant effect" to show the results of the group - it has been reported quite generally.
The fact that the dividends were not paid.
The dividend has already been reduced to the third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a significant state and infrastructure funder since the Depfa takeover.
In comparison to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank refinancing as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the lending between the banks was lost because the banks were keeping their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets each year to refinance a part of Depfa's credit portfolio - about EUR 50 billion.
According to the Communication of Hypo Real Estate, the group's funding needs are covered for the time available to the loan, and the company's protected from the influence of largely inoperable international financial markets.
According to other sources, the refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, Mr Funke, Director General of the HRE, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group does not have to use the money markets for a reasonable period.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Board (BaFin) see that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now secured.
This gives hope to the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamism and invaluability of the crisis, they can't be certain.
It is not even impossible that funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the late Saturday night news that the bank was still on the edge of the bank, even the transition could not reassure the Tuesdays.
The stock exchange rate fell by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, bond exchanges are quite good.
While the debts listed in the first place are hardly changing, the rates of the bonds destined to be reversed significantly.
The crisis concerns, in particular, the former subsidiary, the Württemberg Hypo bonds and, in a fair manner, the maturity over the year 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds previously appeared to be a speculative investment alternative, their value should now be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system and due to the recovery of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution took the crisis almost home by taking Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less endangered business banks are still ready to support the system, the reimbursement of the benefits to the deadlines may take place.
Or it is happening in which almost nobody currently dares to hope that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports relating to partial nationalisation, the probability of certainty has now become just a legitimate remnant.
For long-term creditors, the decision to depart from their investment may lead to uninspired nights.
However, short-term investors may use the sale to make a reserve for the taxes to be paid after the current profits of the coming years.
The secrets of Sylvana and the inside box
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce himself to Tachibana High School on the first day of teaching, the girls start to whip: The German girl is totally "kavai"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the jungles - she's talking about Japan in the new exchange school blog.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I'm really excited.
I was on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kavaszaki, and I'm on a train for 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, and luckily, I didn't miss it.
It seems that the start of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as home in Also-Szonia.
Students start talking from eight hours until a brief conversation with the teacher, home room, starts at 8:00 40:00.
But before the teaching began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
But I'm not the type who'd like to talk to people, especially in front of a 40-study class.
Since I didn't have my school uniform, I wore up my housekeeper's old skirt, bleached, blue knees and black leather shoes.
So in this dress I was standing in front of the cathedra, and I tried to correctly say, "Szajonara, no Sylvana, I'm called Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and I'm going to have my birthday in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I've been learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls whispered, shoved and waved, and I've always heard the word "kavaí".
I've known that from my mangae.
This Japanese girls belong to the basic treasure, and it means "sweet, sweet."
Then I quickly took my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled widely, and it was an honor that she was planted next to the exchange school.
The rest of the hour was calm enough, but when the bell was spoken, they ran regularly.
Everyone talked and laughed and asked questions and drained a hole in my abdomen - and it was quite difficult to understand the English of Japanese.
In the break, everyone packed his benches.
My guest has made me this kind of lunch - it's completely different from the boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I got spice rice, little sausages, salad, fruit and meat made from cucumbers and algae and a tofu.
Most of the time, I don't know what I'm eating in Japan.
The foods look strange, and they taste completely new.
As a matter of fact, everything is very delicious.
Yeah, maybe, except for the salted biscuit, brrrr.
In Japanese schools, the bench isn't just lunch.
Sometimes a girl presents a boy with his own hand-made benzo, which is particularly artistic in the hope of getting closer to the boy in the lunch break.
That's what I read in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can observe this here too.
"Why is it Japan?" asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because you're just charming me."
Eventually, I've been reading the best mangoes for years.
And to understand the comic books and cultures described in them better, I started studying Japanese sometime.
It was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and habits.
And these guys are very honored here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything was so well organized, I've never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have emotions.
A rat or a moth runs out of danger, does that mean you're afraid?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can you look into whether they feel the same when they're acting like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been published by famous scientists for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in one of the series "What does it keep you real without being able to prove it?" sees the answers to the question.
I believe that animals have emotions and other state of consciousness without me or anyone else to prove it so far, it is true that we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
However, in this case, at least we can hope that all human brains are the same.
However, as we look at other species and in general autopsy the issues of consciousness or sensitivity, we find it difficult to access the field because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, he's doing the same thing as many other animals: pretending to be dead, fleeing or attacking.
People are acting in a similar way, resulting in comparative subjective experience by some researchers.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to transfer our own subjective experiences to the animals.
On the one hand, the circuits associated with human consciousness contain almost always the side prefrontal cerebral cerebral cerebral (as a result of its role in short-term memory and implementation/control functions).
This wide area is more advanced for humans than for other mammals, and it seems that other living creatures are completely missing.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cerebral cerebral, for example, knowing who we are or, in the case of planning and decision-making capabilities, it is reasonable to assume that man is even different from the other mammals.
A further dramatic specificity lies in the linguistic nature of man: As a significant part of human experience is related to the language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if consciousness is not dependent on the language, the language would certainly affect it, so animal consciousness, whatever kind it is, is likely to differ strongly from most of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may be like for other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective matter, and because of our experience, the special hardware cannot be analyzed, then his research will cause us to face serious problems.
Most of my cleverness refers to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which is likely to be easier to access to science.
It would be possible to examine the animal's consciousness processes, irrespective of content, and that is exactly what is happening in the case of experiments on the short-term memory of the mammals, especially in the example of visualisation.
However, in the assumption that Christof Koch and Francis Crick also examined, they rely more on the neural links of consciousness than on the Caucasus Mechanisms: Both can be the same, or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also underlines the importance of prefrontal cerebral cerebral in the creation of visualisation.
What will happen to that of emotions?
I recall that an emotional system, such as fear, is activated in the brain that knows its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state where we are when the activity of the brain-based protection system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies a working memory.
Thus, the emotions are closely linked to the areas of the brain basin that are characterised by the mammals and especially human beings.
In addition to the linguistic nature, sensation is subtle as words and linguistics help us to distinguish and categorize conditions so that we describe them in addition to others.
However, Antonio Damasio, for example, feels that emotions come from simpler activities in the body sensation areas of the brain cancer and the brainstorm, as well as Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brainstorm.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the wholesome emotions of the species.
I can't theoretically deny it, but I think it's undeniable.
Pankseep believes that what seems to be fearful in rats and humans in both cases is likely to feel like how to check whether rats and people feel the same when they act like that?
A cockroach escapes in the event of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, just a similar behaviour is not yet proof of the same experience.
Although neural harmonisation continues to help: rats and people have similar brains, the cockroachs have no brains.
But is the cerebral responsible for the emotions?
And even if this could be proven for humans: how can we prove this for rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, but maybe even the tomatoes (who knows?) have emotions.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And as their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (which is based on special circuits and languages of human consciousness), I'm looking for rats' emotional behavior rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is made at the neural level if we measure the same value in rats and humans.
Like I don't research language and consciousness in rats, I don't even know how to feel, because I don't know if they exist.
This may seem like a short-view attitude, but I'm moving forward rather than continually collising into a wall.
I'm a practical physicist.
Platini, President of the UEFA: Army for Poland and Ukraine
Vice-President Ivan Vaszjunik Ukrainian has informed that the preparations are shortly under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government, in its decision of the UEFA Bordeaux, sees confidence in Ukraine and its testimony that they believe that Ukraine can organise the European championship together with Poland", said Vaszjunik.
"This, however, is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is a lot to do in both countries."
Both host countries are missing as regards the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We're gonna have to work with a whip" said Grigorij Szurkis, President of the U.S. Football Alliance.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, you were intended to take a more radical step.
Following several scandals of the National Olympic Committee, the Polish PZPN was suspended, replaced by independent Commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Mr Miroslaw Drzewieck.
"The danger that PZPN is unable to operate according to the rules", Drzewiecki said to the Polish PAP news agency.
"We have assured Michel Platini, President of the UEFA that this will not adversely affect the preparations of the 2012 EB."
Only in the last season, several first league teams had to be assigned to the lower class because of manipulation, and eventually the legastart had to be postponed.
The mad Dennis Quaid cut back
The actress wanted to advertise a new movie, talk about her private life in the interview, and now she's got her ex-husband, and Ryan Hollywood's star has classified her ex-husband Dennis Quaide as a adulterer.
Who's whining and swinging back
A late rose war at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex-part: The two Hollywood actresses seven years after their divorce are fighting a bad fight - before the public.
And Ryan in the interview given to the American InStyle magazine last week was the first to state the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, causing a lot of pain."
And only after she got divorced, she found out how many women Dennis cheated on her.
The spiritual stripping was due to Ryan's new press work on "Women" film, which tells the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid strongly responded to an unfaithful husband, saying, "Free", the 54-year-old actress said to the New York Daily News newspaper, "that Meg repeated the story of our relationship and moved over."
In addition, it is unfortunate that 16-year-old joint boys, Jack, repeatedly, "really reminds you of all the pain and changes that the divorce causes a child."

Prices of tickets and hotel rooms are reduced
In the first half of 2008, European airways and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, airways in Germany were not less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of airways and hotel rooms have been again more favourable - so they can be summarised as a result of one of the studies of American Express travel and financial service providers.
The company analysed the first semester of 2008 booking data and determined a significant fall in prices in the second quarter after the first quarter price increase.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 per cent from 48 European cities examined in 41 compared to 2007.
However, during the period from April to June, prices were already 3,6 % lower than in the previous year.
This trend was evident in the most unequivocally in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 per cent less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees the reason for this in the low price of the dollar, which led to "relieving tourists of the American tourists".
The decline in hotel room prices is more affected by financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hannover, Köln or Stavanger.
In the city of Norway, the rise in hotel prices of 26.3 per cent is a European record.
In the first quarter, there was also an increasing change in the prices of flight tickets.
Due to the abundance of kerosine, passengers in the tourist class had to pay 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, and long-term airways with high fuel demand costed 29,2 per cent.
From April to June, prices of tourist-class tickets decreased by 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, however, in business and first class prices showed only a much more moderate change.
Prices fell even more in Germany than in other European countries.
Prices increased by 11.9 per cent between January and March, decreased by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the prices of domestic flights in Germany decreased to half.
The reason for the price reduction lies, on the one hand, in the moderate economic growth - the company claims.
In many segments of the airport market, demand has weakened.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement liberalising air travels between the US and Europe strengthens the pressure of the competitive situation.
The stressed situation is confirmed by airlines cancelling their loss of flights and several airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe, it affects 24 airlines.
Gladbachot beats to HSV 1:0
A goal and simple methods were put on the edge of the tabella in Hamburger SV.
Luhukay at Borussia is still unable to find a working team.
Kristoffer Klein Enlargement Deep Flight for National Selected Marko Marin.
The gladbachi player only got into play late and lifted back from the gate.
His exact text has left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," swept Hermann Rieger in the corridor leading to the arena cabins in Hamburg.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them sat back in their place.
Rieger had been the physicotherapy of the HSV for almost three decades, enjoying a greater authority than a few bowling players.
Thus, his request was found to be heard at the competent place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol stabbed and agreed to show his thumb.
Cornelius is the son of the head coach of Hamburg, Martin Jol.
His orders may have been like: Give me the second Goal!
The order has been executed.
"Today wasn't always a nice sight" - admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt also imagined it.
1: 0 (1:0) is a goal of result due to the head of Mladen Petric of the hamburgers (11.); and the condition that very weak gladbachs could not cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
Martin Jol summarised it.
Hamburger SV is now 121 years old on Monday.
The viewers have celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena, and the chart appearing on the screen, which presented their team as the head of the championship.
It's gonna be a partyless birthday.
"We know where to put it," Marcell Jansen said.
It assumes that the intermediate certificate of the tabella indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of the HSV.
Although, thanks to his lately committed contracts, the team finds herself slowly, but it doesn't brilliant yet.
"We need more senses and acts," said Jol.
After the vote
Wall Street is intimidated by fear.
The first news on the failure of the rescue package resulted in Dow Jones temporarily falling 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in his history in one day.
Later, the Dow got something stronger.
At 20:30, the world's most important stock exchange barometer was 5 percent minus and 10.579 points.
Nasdaq, who was selling technology papers, fell to more than seven percent minus 1548 points.
Dow's biggest loser at this moment was the American Express with 14% loss, followed him by 12 percent of the Bank of America.
None of the papers were strengthened.
Goldman Sachs bank's shares fell by nearly 10%.
Just a few days earlier he bought a share in the bank of Warren Buffett is a big investor.
As part of the rescue measure, funds are intended to be made available for the purchase of so-called two mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not intended to be paid at the same time, but gradually.
In exchange, the State would receive the shares option vouchers of financial institutions, which would be available in the event of appropriate developments in exchange rates, reducing the burden of the public fund.
European and US and stock exchange rates
The billions of aid for European and US banks do not dissolve the doubts of investors.
Hypo Real Estate's German big bank's stock exchange rate is falling, and he's holding Dax with him.
The U.S. Dow Jones show is declining despite the rescue planned by the government on the money market.
The spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have deeply attracted the German share index (Dax).
Despite the rescue operations of the federal government and private banks, the capital of the Munich Real Estate funder fell to a quarter, the Commerzbank fell by more than 20 percent.
The Dax has fallen under the 6000 specific boundaries of psychological importance and recorded 5839 points with 3,7 percent minus.
Share markets have been forced on knees all over the world.
Wall Street opened up in New York with a major loss.
The investors fear that the US Government's $700 billion rescue package will not be enough to boost the money markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, i.e. 3,3 per cent to 10.809,25 points.
The American Parliament wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate vote can take place on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed 3.2% weakening, and CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index went up to 11.743,61 per cent after the initial strength.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped to 2.1 per cent 18.286,90 points.
The Indian Sensex showed 506,43 points, i.e. 3.9 percent, and closed at 12.595,75 points.
On Mdax's stock exchange, Arcandor's shares were weakened after notification of the capital increase.
The Sal. Oppenheimer private bank registered 23 million new shares.
In the commercial and tourism concert, he also stated that Thomas Cook's shares were not sold.
Dark material affects the flight of spacezones
A mysterious phenomenon for years causes inappropriateness among researchers. Dark material affects the speed of spacezones during the so-called swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general relativity principle cannot be fully correct.
The "Ulysses" spacezone flew in space for almost 18 years.
The soon-frozen fuel pipelines threaten the freezing death.
A mysterious phenomenon, swing-by anomaly, has been disturbing among scientists for years.
Swing-by means the gravity of spacezones in which a sky body, such as the Earth's gravity field, is added to additional momentum.
So the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The research partner in the European-American Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sunshine of Ulysses.
What, however, has attracted researchers for years: Lending objects are not fully acting as it would be expected under the ancient gravity law.
Instead, there are abnormalities in the speed.
The probes are suddenly speeding up or slowing down.
The physicists have never found any explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was baptized as an anomaly of swing-by.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's overall relativity cannot be fully correct, which considers the mass extraction of the material as a curve of space.
Stephen Adler is an American physicist, the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, who continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong and is trying to explain the Swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark material that the astronauts discovered in the universe.
"The anomaly may be responsible for the dark matter that may be found near Earth," writes Adler.
The world space researchers learned about the existence of dark material only ten years ago.
Obviously, it creates a gravity force that can be observed to affect other sky bodies.
However, the substance itself is completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light, does not release or beaten back.
According to scientists, a good fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark material.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt were released
After ten days in the captivity of their kidnappers, the tourists taken in Egypt are again free - confirmed by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese kidnappers charged millions of euros of ransom.
In the shooting before the hostages were released, allegedly six hostages lost their lives.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in South Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are already taking place.
Again and again, Germans are being targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports the most important cases.
European tourists in Sahara are free.
This was reported consistently by the Egyptian public television, the Al-Arabian Arab TV and Italian media.
According to Italian Sky TG 24 television broadcasters, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: "Our fellows and other hostages have been released.
We're currently investigating their health status," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, and a Romanian citizens and eight Egyptian escorts are safe and safe - reported by the Egyptian public television.
19 participants in the desert expedition are supposed to be on their way to Cairo.
The reason for the shooting before the hostages were released is still blurred: according to the Egyptian security officer, the hostages have already shown their willingness to release hostages when the Sudanese army suddenly killed their six.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom," said the official.
"The trial was only about taking hostages," when it suddenly happened, "the surprise."
On Sunday, Sudanian soldiers shot six kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and two arrested.
The hostages demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been transferred to the German wife of a hostage.
The Al-Masri al-Jom newspaper, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release of hostages was withdrawn because the kidnappers are concerned about their own integrity.
According to the report, women's hostages are released after payment of the ransom.
Men are held by kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"To lead to suicide" is stepfather's violence
The court said that a woman was suicide because her stepfather raped her for years.
In the village of Stithians in Cornwall County, Michael Trerise, 57 years old, spent six years in prison after he confessed to attempting a rape on eightfold.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that he regularly tied up his stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's statements, he wrote: "I feel like I'm an excellent for his death."
The trial stated that Randle was committed to suicide at the home of the town of Plymouth in the Mutley district, at the age of 34, on 1 April 2007.
When he lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied him up and tied his eyes in front of the colonies while his mother worked in a beer shop.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and re-elected Cornwall.
His stepmother moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turns out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust Monument Protection Organization, was persecuted by the terrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle, who used to love surfing and biking, said "sense dead" and "speaking about life".
In April 2007, Terrance Randle found her father dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle was confronted with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his confession in a letter: "I tied her up and tied her up all the time.
I wasn't sexually harassmented.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You were extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure it was terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim's suicide.
But even more thoughtful is the fact that if he did not do so, the case might never have been brought before the court."
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to the impact of Stephanie's parents on their daughter of the crime you committed over the years.
If this didn't happen, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
The official who lost the important data was accused of.
According to the BBC's reports, they accuse the government official of infringinging a secret of office, who's strictly forgotten classified documents on a train in June.
The man was posted by experts from the Ministry of Defence when he left two strictly secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were transferred to the police.
This is the lowest accusation of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of deliberate assault.
Frank Gardner, a reporter from the BBC Department of Defense, said the move was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
"They thought that the Ministry of Defence and the Government would treat the case as an internal case", said.
The employee who cannot be appointed was accused of under point 8.1 of the Law. This paragraph is about the preservation of information.
The State Prosecutor suggested that the accusation against the Officer be represented by the Metropolitan Police by the man for his rather sensitive work in relation to the Joint Public Procurement Committee.
The documents he lost included secret surveys on Al-Qaida and the ability of the Iraqi Army.
On Monday, he was informed of the decision and then moved from his home to an unknown place.
Household-building cooperatives pay the account of B&amp;B
UK housing cooperatives can count more than £80 million after saving Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The government spent 14 billion quids to protect its deposits by Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that use deposit holders' money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, Chairman of the Association of Home Constructions (BSA), it is "aggravating" that companies and members must pay.
Finally, the 14 billion important loan will be reimbursed after the repayment of Bradford &amp; Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest accumulated during the period shall be charged annually to the 700 financial companies using the loans.
The Financial Services Discount System has confirmed to BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are among them.
It is annoying that the institutions that have been prudently active so far must now pay the accounts of the institutions that were much less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We found out that all companies have to pay in such a proportion as the amount of deposits they hold, and that they share 18% of each other's costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan will reach 450 million in 2009.
This means that companies need to lose quid 81 million to pay the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, director of the trade union of housing companies, told BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
"It is uncomfortable that those institutions must pay the accounts of much less prudent institutions that have taken care of during the recovery of the housing market."
According to BSA, no company has been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
"In all respects, we need to examine this case in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and members from a significant amount of account," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September of this year.
In 2010, a full yearly interest will be paid, which may be twice as it is now.
Since housing cooperatives are self-assisting organisations, without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the account either through higher fees or lower interest received after their deposits.
The price of milk increases by five pennys per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The dairy company in Jersey has announced that it will increase the price of milk by more than five pennys per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two penny increases in February and the survey carried out by a consultative company.
Resaleers themselves decide whether to transfer price increases to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of milk in Jersey last changed in 2002.
They rejected the request of the former representative of Bangladesh to defend freely
The Court of Bangladesh rejected the application for protection of former MEP Sheikh Hasina on the patent, which means that they can be arrested when returning to the country.
His attorney said that the court refused to defend him on the ground that he was blackmailing a businessman at the time of his parliamentary representation of $50 million ($729,700).
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina, an old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released this month.
Sheikh Hasina must return to Bangladesh for the next few weeks, but the Awami League demands that the temporary government supported by the country's army give him full freedom first.
According to the reports, although conditional immunity has been made to go abroad for treatment, the conditions of the free footing do not clearly show whether you can preserve your freedom when you return to the country.
Your lawyers say that you will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
"The Court of Appeal rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for a bail that it is not necessary, because it has already been placed on the loose foot and has been involved in foreign treatment," we learned Rafique from Huq's attorney.
"We're going to step up the decision of the appeal court."
According to his lawyers, he needs to be protected in the free state so he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after 17 October.
Last year, after the temporary government supported by the army took over the power, he was released from prison in June to go abroad for treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Problems regarding the vaccination programme against Afghanistan Polyo
According to the United Nations, nearly 200 000 children from Afghanistan remained out of the recently organised polio vaccination programme because of violence on the Taliban.
Last week, the UN has organised a protective vaccination in six counties.
However, they said that for safety reasons they could not reach the children living in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
According to the United Nations Confessor, this happened despite the promise of the Taliban: they will not attack or hinder the work of thousands of staff in the vaccination process.
The appeal of BSkyB to ITV has been rejected
The appeal of BskyB was rejected against the decision of the Committee on Competition Rights, which instructed him to reduce its interest in the rival TV, ITV.
The Competition Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
Previously, the Committee concluded that BSkyB's participation would hinder competition and dishonestly influence the company over the ITV.
BSkyB purchased its share in 2006 and thus effectively prevented the NTL, which has been renamed to Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Office reported that the share purchased by BSkyB from ITV would jeopardise the independence of ITV, encouraging the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
The director of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's supervisors were all opposed to buying.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV participation would be unreasonable and disproportionate, particularly in view of the fact that the BSkyB expressed its willingness to give up its voting rights.
Another investigation of the U.S. State Attorneys case
The U.S. main prosecutor has appointed a special prosecutor for examining the executives of nine US prosecutors in 2006.
The step followed the fact that the case report by the Chief Inspector of the Justice Wall criticised the decisions of the government officials.
The report judged the officials of the White House, the lawmakers and the former chief prosecutor, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was fearful that the prosecutors were saved from political consideration.
Nora Dannehy, Special Prosecutor will now investigate whether the investigators in the investigation tried to prevent justice by lying.
"The serious accusations of possible crime have not yet been investigated and it has not been cleared," said Glenn Fine, Chief Inspector.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor who was empowered to make witnesses confession.
The series began with nine state attorneys removed from their position in December 2006.
At that time, they said that state attorneys were released because of their weak performance.
However, it later turned out that the exiled public attorneys had nothing worse than many of their other colleagues, which led many to the conclusion that political consideration was taken behind the expulsions.
Some state attorneys participated in the prosecution process of high-level Republican Congress members, while others refused to participate in the investigation of electoral fraud charges against democrats.
The U.S. State Attorneys are investigating the government and conducting court cases.
They can be saved at any time, but they cannot be removed from their position for political reasons.
At that time, the head of the court wallet, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of the attacks of state attorney and eventually resigned.
Many other officials in the Justice Wallet have also given up their resignation.
In his report, Gonzales greatly criticised the role of the case, and he believes that the main prosecutor's "primary responsibility" is for discharges, for the "reported" control and "excellently withdrawn" from the process.
Other officials - including Karl Rove, former helper of the older Bush - criticize the lack of cooperation in the investigation.
Meat Loaf Eposa receives recognition
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored for the epic hymn of "Bat Out Of Hell" in the Q Awards Prize Gale.
The singer who will receive his special golden award next week at the London celebration said it was an honor.
The nine minutes, fifty-second song was the song of Meat Loaf in 1977, the album of the public success.
The Coldplay received most of the awards for this year, four categories of candidate lists.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that cross the borders of time or genres and "Bat Out Of Hell."
Jim Steinman's song needed a very big voice, and that sound was Meat Loafe.
The song started with an almost two-minute instrumental stunt.
He appeared as a small album in 1979, and he got to 15 on the hit lists.
However, the album of Meat Loaf "Bat Out Of Hell" was present on the camper lists for almost nine years, and then over 40 million copies were sold.
Meat Loaf - a real name Marvin Lee Aday - has recently had health problems. Among others, in 2003, she suffered surgery due to heart rhythm disorder after she collapsed on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts because of a slight genital inflammation.
Later it turns out there's cyst on the wire.
An unknown large city street, often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of routes, tours and other sideways, some of them are famous, others are merely practicable.
However, many trained taxi drivers and long-time local residents could find it hard to tell us where the Extra Place is, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The little street is in East Village, heading north from First Street, without reaching Second Street, between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Approximately 9 m wide and 36 m long and much more like a dust alley than a main transport route.
There are no street boards.
Technically, you can't find it on a standard map.
But the street has admirers.
It is there, for example, the Avalon Bay, the building of the newly built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to bury the Extra Place again, and he wants to ensure that the new buildings stores and butiks can be accessed in a clearer way.
The admirers of the street include the neighbours who have long lived here, who have been caught in the dark streets, that this was the only remains of the past before the surrounding renovations.
However, the owner of the street, the building and development department of the city, does not have to insist on it.
In this month, at a meeting of the Regional Management Committee of the Regional Government of the Regions, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the Committee would prefer the street to remain in the city's management and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, reported by Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Municipal Board No 3.
"There are so few areas in the city, and we want Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
"So we can make proposals for renovation and management that Avalon can perform, but we also want to ensure that it is available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that he wanted to bury the small street again, and he wanted to have seats, and that part would be used by a coffee shop that the builder is expected to rent a area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, the speaker of Avalon Bay, told me that even though the company wants to use the street, he doesn't insist on holding it.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to refurbish this dead alley and make it a pleasant public sound," he said, adding that the city suggested buying.
Seth Donlin, the Speaker of the Conservation Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and noted that the office was responsible for building buildings and not management.
Her colorful neighbor, compared to Bowery, Extra Place, has little historical significance.
Some say that in 1802, he received the name "one country", when Philip Minthorne's great possession was divided among his numerous children, and no one kept a demand for narrow ground range.
The Punk-rock monument closed in 2006, the rear entrance of the CBGB was opened to Extra Place, and perhaps the street was the most popular photograph of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia" album.
"Remek scene" said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"He was full of garments, dresses, barrels, poster pieces, and wood leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how they own East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, whatever modest, must remain in the community.
Others mention Extra Place as a rareity, which is a virtually unchanged piece of the city and which must be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, the author of a bitter nostalgia in the process of the city's death, published a part of the Extra Place story in 1952 in the article "The New Yorker", which was published in the article "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is even in the middle of the day dark, bound by stainless, iron rocket doors and spalt windows, and where the wind wears one week's newspapers in the channels."
The street, except for a few exceptions, looked the same way a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street, next to the back door that used to drive to the CBGB, and now he's got a higher flooded clothing store in his place.
It was graffiti on the walls, and an empty, 0.75 litre of beer bottle was lying next to a dumped fresh paper fish.
Some of the travellers told me that they rarely think of the Extra Place, but they think we could use a renovation.
Fields said that some of them underestimate their attractiveness in the current state of the street.
"I've spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, gloomy and disgusting places," he said.
Discussion on two-lingual education: Continuous exposure to the English linguistic environment
In this section, the Education Monitor is debating the opinion of Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Isumi of the candidates on two-lingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher and director of education research in the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research in California, the "Not as good as you think: Why does the middle class need a school selection option" book.
It is not easy to be in favour of voters from Spanish.
Barack Obama's proposals for education are also included here.
According to Obama's campaign, "Afro-American and Spanish lip students are likely to obtain a degree significantly less than white students," and that's true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama's education plan expressly supports "transition two-lingual education" for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether the commitment to dual-lingual education, which focuses on school education in non-English, will be overcome by its interest in combating high performance differences.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep contracted general school in the eastern part of Los Angeles county.
Most of the students at school are Spanish lips and low incomes.
More than a third of students - many of whom have recently arrived - learn English.
However, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state mathematics test.
It is also impressive that 93% of the fourth graders have performed excellently in the English language and literature test.
This incredible performance was not achieved by the instrument that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repeating, practicing, continuing evaluation of skills and rejecting objections.
Furthermore, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school education principle is the 'full involvement' of English students in the language environment.
The essence of the embrace method is almost exclusive use of English in teaching other objects.
Mikels, who opposed two-lingual education, said, "We've got a great success that if someone walked in a classroom, he wouldn't notice who was the student who came back from Mexico 12 months earlier."
"It's working," he said, "We're working."
Would Obama, as an example, provide schools like Sixth Street Prep for other schools educating a significant number of Spanish lips and English students?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear, but because of the education policy of its own party (National Education Associations have long supported dual-language education), and since they are consistently supporting dual-language education themselves, we cannot be sure of Obama's response.
Although you agree that immigrants need to learn English, Obama has recently expressed an appreciative statement of the question when he said that people should not be so concerned about the "only English" of the law.
Instead, he said, "they should be able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to achieve a reduction in the differences between the results, you should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and ignoring them.
The oil price was rigorous because of the new economic concerns.
On Monday, oil prices fell steep because of the concerns that America's rescue plan for financial markets will not be able to stimulate the economy.
Raw oil's securities went back to $99.80 a.m. at the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices decreased by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
For the last two weeks, the stock exchange has been undermined by the financial confusion in Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached $ 145.29 per barrel in July, the barrels went back to almost $90 at the beginning of this month before they reintroduced the immeasurable uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were reintroduced by concern even after the Congress's leaders announced that they were able to agree on the economic rescue action, which is the greatest in history.
The news has been shadowed by the concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
The latest events of the emerging crisis will be purchased by the Citigroup of Wachovia Corporation's bank business, announced by the government on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to the Barclays Capital analysts, the result of the desperate weekend negotiations seems to be "likely, the rescue operation has failed to revive the stock market enthusiasm."
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for goods, such as oil, is also expected to decrease.
"The future of the market for stock shares, interest rates and exchange rates has become uncertain all over the world," wrote Deutsche Bank as an analyst for investors.
"We think that the market in goods will not be avoided by the epidemic.
The biggest question for the stock exchange is the extent to which the US's "sickness" infects the whole world, especially China."
As oil consumption decreased due to the slowdown of economic growth, the analysers of the banks declined from their expectations for the next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
With the bravour of the second quarter, the team set up its records
After the last eight seasons spent more time in the Jets field than anyone else, Shaun Ellis playing in the Defensive end position thought he'd seen everything.
But then he looked at the opening of the second quarter on Sunday, when Jets changed a pointless game into a sensational field.
"I've never seen that before," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals came into full harmony with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback gave Laveranues Coles 12 yards of touchdown paste. It became a perfect advance for a afternoon in which their progressive cooperation has evolved significantly.
Favre gave Coles two touchdown pastes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell after each other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't regret the trouble," said Favre about all the passports that she gave to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We've been able to communicate well so far, regardless of what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing balls, defense stopped the Cardinals controller, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, playing in the cornerback position, caught a bad shot and threw it back at 32 yards, which meant touchdown.
Eric Smith, the safety player got into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to hit the ball out of Warner's hand.
This could have been the last turn of the most amazing game.
However, when Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and Jets got it, Jay Feely kicked the 20-yard field, setting the 34:0 results.
That was the best result Jets has ever achieved in a quarter.
When they asked the Jets coach Eric Mangini to characterize the sensible nature of the game, he said, "The second or the third quarter?"
When they told him that both - in the third quarter Cardinals got 21 points so that Jets didn't get one - Mangini said: "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third quarter.
We got a lot of points in a short time."
The resting Gebrselassie will set up his own world record
The Ethiopia Haile Gebrselassie again showed why many of them were considered the best medium and long-distance driver ever lived in Berlin when he broke his own world record on Sunday, and he became the first one to run 42.2 kilometers in 2 hours 4 minutes.
At the comfortable flat track, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds during the time of 2:03:59 in the previous score of 2:04:26, which was achieved last year in Berlin.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie set up the 26th world record of his career in so many areas that from 1500 metres to marathon almost every distance gained world championship or world records.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Peking, fearing that, in view of this, it may have been too cautious that air pollution would further exacerbate her asthmatic problems.
Instead, he called me to Berlin Marathon.
Under almost perfect conditions, Gebrselassie won on Sunday, incredibly 2 minutes at 56 seconds per kilometres at the time of day, at the beginning of 9 °C and at the end of 13 °C.
Since the maraton runners, such as Gebrselassie, and Paul Terga, Kenya, had turned to the long runs, the maraton record decreased more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa in 1998 with the result in Berlin at 2:06:05.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago, his two legs were cramped and couldn't train for two weeks.
Obviously, it was fresh during the forced rest, and it wasn't rusty.
"I'm so happy", Gebrselassie told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started retraining a week ago, and today I had doubts, but finally everything was all right."
He received some criticisms - especially from Kenya, Ethiopia's Eastern African rival - that he is using too many tools in his competitions, usually avoiding many world-famous marathon runners, leaving iramfutors as if he was running on the field and putting world records before the spirit of competition.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's excellence in long-distance.
Gebrselassie reached the peak by four Kenya iramfutors on Sunday 1:02:04.
Two live-line Kenya runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after they had exhausted.
Not much more than 4,8 kilometers before the target, Gebrselassie abandoned Kwambai with a last sprint, secondly targeted by 2:05:36, fixed by 5 minutes on its individual best.
Kamathi got in as third in 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, has closed a remarkable year with the fastest victory of the seventh, 2:19:19.
The World Summit is held by British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
During the spring, Mikitenko 36-year-old won a surprise at London Marathon with the result of 2:24:14.
The Peking Olympics could not have been involved because of the alleged back injury, but it was quickly healed and won the Berlin marathon, where he improved his individual peak five minutes.
He won the competition with smart expectation: he first allowed a four-person group of ethiopias and Kenyai to advance and to take a significant lead, and then he came after about 30 km.
The Ethiopip Askale Tafa Magarsa targeted secondly at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop in Kenya became third with 2:25:01 results.
A separate city, pride and trials of blacks
The experience park in Greater Orland - a few miles away from everything that shines, loud and powerful - is hidden in a quiet small town where the pride and complexities of African-American life have been born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city that encompassed the country, and which was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, is now not as simple as it was described in 1935: "The five lakes, three croquet tracks, 300 brown skin, 300 good swims, a lot of guawas and two schools without prison."
It's a pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have been to the Zora festival that has been organized every year.
Yet, in many respects, the city described and made it tourist attraction - which is also included in the Florida Roadbook issued by the Federal Authors of Crimea Project - is separate from the environment.
Samely independent, decent and closed as in the 1930s, when Hurston, according to one of his writings, was often unwilling to share their true thoughts with white people, who know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing."
Even in the year when the black president's candidate Barack Obama opens his mind on the racial issue, many here are untrusted to the outsiders' eyes.
The 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here his whole life, and the oldest church in the city.
"You have to say it correctly."
Eatonville has been characterized for a long time by winning and fighting paradoxone.
At the same time, it is a historical model for black exits, but it is a nearly 2400-person community where poverty indicators reach the national average double.
Partly a literary node and partly an example of American slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes glorified, southern, urban, black culture that flows in the shadows of oak trees.
So it's not surprising that the residents here are both proud and defenders.
And the picture of Eatonville has been important since Zora (this is what everyone calls Hurston).
In the books written in the truthful, strong dialection, "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) presented his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida Roadbook transformed the city by road 17 to one of the locations of the history of blacks and human dramas.
Hurston, who was brave in life and in literature, even the drummer, introduced readers to the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: "We find the modern public school right from the road with a brown-based white corner, well-being courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller cares for, although he can barely write and read."
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband, and he wrote that Lee Glenn sells all kinds of drinks, and anything that might be needed in temporary accommodations.
So some hundred words Hurston brought Eatonville into contact with autonomy, but also with inconsistency, remarriation, and sex.
Obviously, the Fodor's passport introduced it differently.
This description really didn't everyone liked it.
"Zora told me things like they were," reported the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, and Hurston made them immortal by quoting the songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like it."
They still remember Hurston as the first freak who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville in Florida.
Augustus 77 - year - old Franklin recalled that when Hurston stormed into town, he usually arrived in Chevrolet without notice, smoking cigarettes, and in a long pants to a city where people still are proud of their dignity.
Most of the people were charming, said Franklin, but a lot of people were charming.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Franklin.
However, on the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added in his chair, "No longer.
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer published again.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with most of the world, forgot about it.
Although he was ever a popular writer, Langston Hughes' age, and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in an insignificant grave in Fort Pierce in Florida, where he lived before.
There were no significant memoirs in Eatonville or large public readings.
"I don't think they understood how rich the world was, or what he left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, the author of the book Hurston, published in 2003.
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-gauge road through the city instead of the two-gauge main street, the Kennedy Avenue, which had an important role in the community's life.
The expanding Orlandó has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorways connected to the states on the west side of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still walking after a difficult history period.
Among other things, enhanced integration has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the wars on race mixing have tasted hatred with the community.
"At the same time, a group of white boys came over and threw the oranges and other things on the side of the road," Franklin told me.
"There was a woman who died in this.
They threw a Greek melon out of a car."
In a letter written by The Orlando Sentinel, in 1955, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court for violent integration. So he said of the decision called "Brown v Board of Education": "He is more offending than respecting my species."
Today, the citizens say that the deszegregation of schools was positive in some respects, weakened the consolidation of the eatonvilles and undermined the confidence of young people.
"The black children used to kill them - that I remember - the man huged his teacher in the morning and night" - reported the daughter of N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins, Managing Director of the Nonprofit Organisation called Eatonville.
"This took me until the students and teachers came from a joint place," he said.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us", said Nathiri.
However, human rights helped to raise many other Zora Neale Hurston - in black writers, actresses and artists who have risen up in prejudices, as he did, with sober confidence and ranks as follows: "How can anyone deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!
That's incomprehensible for me."
In 1975, Alice Walker conspired to Hurston's insignificant grave and began to fight to give his reputation back.
Five years later, the bookstore shelves were put into the shelves by Robert E. Hemenway, a recognized Hurston's biography, which reintroduced it to America's role models.
The roadbuilding project would have started just when Eatonville's most famous daughter returned to the focus of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors looked at him as a savior.
In 1988, the community started organizing a Hurston festival to show us what would destroy the county's main route.
Thousands of fans have arrived at the opening event two years later, and many have been returning to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the county refused its roadbuilding proposal.
"Because of the five-distance of the main road, the community revived, connected to full speed, which means real civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped change the image of the city itself.
There was an increasing number of people outside the city, such as Rachelle Munson's lawyer, who started to go to church in 1993, and the locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the National Historical List in 1998.
In 2006, the new, flat (naturally called Hurston) library was opened on the rewritten and enclosed Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remains Florida's cucumber toast: it is not only ten miles from Orlando's center, but sometimes it feels like a suburban side street during the summer rain; it's as small as when 27 black families founded in the 1880s.
(90% of the inhabitants are black today)
They're still taking care of outsiders who come here looking for Eatonville's story.
For most interviews, a prior authorisation is required, and a few things, such as the oldest fresco of Eatonville, which a white man painted and black people working on the ground, should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, including the self-confident teacher Jones, who are particularly attracted to the vibrant red one, fear that their separate community is misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival became increasingly wider, the pride of the hometown grew.
In particular, young people are increasingly viewed as Eatonville, as Hurston saw his own species: wonderful, problems and everything together, not better, or worse, as proud, creative, busy, foolish and disturbed as other race and ethnic groups in America.
Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who's planning to return to the local government, or to the police, after the college has been completed.
And it seems that the younger ones also learned to describe Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just travel through here think this town is nothing compared to the others," said Alondra Kenon recently after the celebration of God on a Sunday.
"But if someone stops and wants some time to get to know his history, it's a very nice city."
We're all talking financial language here in New York.
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If tourists didn't care about the journalist bulkheads and the vast television player on Times Square, I wouldn't notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with the glass-blooded, bee-shaped offices over their heads, bankers and risk fund managers who have held New York in power have lived the most difficult days since 1929.
The couriers are still squeezing their metal tea trucks on the walks, carrying trays loaded with muffin for breakfast meetings.
There are still men with Spanish lips in the block houses, carrying fifty rolled shirts as human mussels, hanging in a cloth like a cloth over their shoulders.
The office workers are still in line for their sweet breakfast bakery in the cars on the street, and they are still impossible to take a taxi between 4:00 and 7:00 on the ordinary afternoon.
I didn't feel that there would be any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the emergency news, I didn't decide to open a new bank account.
I was deliberately planning to take care of this during the afternoon rest of my JP Morgan Chase bank's local account, but there were 20 people in the line before me.
Not at the banker's window where money can be picked up or paid, but at the customer service counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's store and where new clients open a bank account.
A lot of people in front of me, I later found out from Starr, the banker who ordered me, they were in line with the same intentions as me.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money from smaller banks in their dwellings, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from the so-called guarantees (such as housing cooperatives), credit cooperatives and small-town savings stocks that operate only in one state and allegedly treat their customers as family members.
Last year, 15 such banks have been ruined quietly.
In recent days, a bank with $327 billion capital in Washington Mutual has been held under bankruptcy, and when the New Yorks started home by weekend, another bank, Wachovia, a bank-saving buyer of $440 billion.
The office and store employees ahead of me, fearing another collapse, they transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe shelter, to the bank that makes most of the capital injection purchases on Wall Street.
The simple people in New York have become an expert in finances in the last few weeks.
A woman in the local Chinese store said on her phone that she went bankrupt from Lehman Brothers bank and her huge-looking CEO Dick Fuld was complaining to a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform of my apartment's block, he changed his 50-year-old caretaker, and we were not talking about Brad and Angelina, or my food delivery, as we used to.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I invested all my savings in cash market assets.
I changed, you didn't risk it."
Muslim graves were mourning while Austria was on the right side
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the Austrian Freedom Party on the right hand, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian Right-wing Party, Vlaams Belang, participated in an demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008, in which the organization called "Väers against Islam Threatment".
Traffic boards have been stretched with symbols that represent the mosques crossed with a red line.
According to the police, extremists on the extreme are responsible for the harassment of Austrian Muslim funerals, which took place at the same weekend when the extremist parties had made significant progress in national parliamentary elections.
There's more than 90 graves in the trauni cemetery next to Linz, between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators were drawing Jewish symbols, such as David stars on a few graves, but the detectives said they were trying to hide their extreme motives from the hatred of immigrants in Muslim.
It is not clear whether the incident can be associated with the elections in some way.
A spokesman in the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply corrupted" at the hearing of the cemetery, which happened shortly before the end of Ramadan, the Muslim religious month.
At the same time, Austria is conducting a conscience review after yesterday's parliamentary elections, in which the language of the political balance is right.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which received almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the future of the Liberty Party and the Austrian Federation for a strong anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were stalled as alien haters of their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the President of the Liberal Party, who holds more than 18% of the votes, expressed the campaign against the headlines and bulls and not the allegedly associated with food.
At the final meeting of the party in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood", which will help prevent Islam from strengthening.
Both parties want to protest the construction of the mosques and mines, arguing that they are the political symbols of the ongoing Islamicism of Austria and Europe.
According to public opinion studies and analyses carried out directly after the extreme victory, the change was largely due to the young electoral base who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter was banned from a foreign trip.
Garry Glitter, convicted of sexual rape of children, known rock star was banned by the court from travelling in France and Spain.
The judges decided to inform the control authorities of their intention to travel through France to Spain in addition to Glitter’s six-month ban.
The Kent Police received a ban on the trip by Thursday after submitting evidence to the court on the judgments against Glitter on rape against children.
Glitter, named Paul Gadd, was not involved in the trial of Kent Ashford Magistrates, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent Police submitted a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court in order to prevent Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up personally."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of its intention to travel abroad because it is obligated by the law on members of the sexual offences register.
It shall notify the authorities if it intends to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also obliged to notify the police at least seven days before the planned departure.
If it does not notify the authorities, it may be sentenced to a five-year loss of freedom.
The Kent Police told me that they don't want to talk about the unique cases in Glitter County and possible whereabouts.
We learned from the Kent Police spokesman: "The Kent Police will do everything they can to protect the children inside the country and abroad.
"We believe that it is easier to check someone if you do not leave the United Kingdom because there is a comprehensive system for us to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the Kent Police is to protect the population of Kent.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after he spent 27 months in a prison in Vietnam for raping a 10 and 11 - year - old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he should have boarded a flight to London.
However, he claimed that he was sick, and he refused to fly to London.
The landscape authorities were not allowed to passport investigation, so he finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities were also not allowed to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where the officials of the Land Police and the Immigration Office insisted on returning to Great Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, Heathrow airport arrived at Terminal 3 and remained there until David Corker went to the court of West London, uxbridge, as Scotland Yard requested, was registered under a court order for sexual offences.
Glitter spent four months in prison in 1999 for the possession of photographs of child rape in the United Kingdom.
According to a source of Home Affairs, Jacqui Smith, Minister of State for Home Affairs, has welcomed Glitter's failure to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take pictures on the stage because I want to introduce the artist from the personal page" Günther Bauer Photographer
No decorations, no haircuts, no dancing shoes.
From the great masters of the flamenco, without the enthusiasm of the act, to get to know the usual face of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in the moments away from the inner audience, when we have a personal move, we can capture the depths of a caught look, or we can admire the beauty of an unspecified, but expressing hand.
In the German series of photographs by Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, the theatre of singers, dancers and guitars is linked to these less known common sites of masters.
Through the photographs, the flamenco's specific iconography is presented from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the international importance of the flamenco day by day", believes the author, adding that Flamenco-people's "composer" could be anyone, because the pictures are seen by the observer in the shock that these images are not typically depicted by the artists.
These people on the street are artists who are able to bring passion, sadness, joy on the stage... and plunge the audience.
But stage photography is not suitable for grabbing their personality.
Their personality and character are the deepest of their beings.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to inherit the personality of the greats of the flamenco through the camera."
In 1997, the Cante de las Minas festival led Bauer to his long journey, making portraits of flamenco singers, guitars and dancers with plate cameras.
These portraits quote classic photography thanks to the camera and the theme selection.
However, the use of different stylistical tools breaks from traditional image design and suggests modernity. The following reflects faithfully the idea of Bauer about the flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, but it changes from day to day and always impressive."
Not dancing, not singing or music alone, rather the artist's personality, character magic of the audience.
In the days of the El Photomata gallery, the leading motif of the works is the search for the essence of the artistic magic, which becomes visible through the means of sensation, existence and appearance.
The known shapes of the flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are metalled by this photography collection of sixty artists.
The project has also become a flamenco-antology, about which a album will soon be published in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits has been cornered by the "SportART project" series for two years to repeat the idea.
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is a little different from that, the photographer adds: "I like to photograph people, to get to know them and to enter their lives for a longer or shorter time.
In my opinion, the most difficult stage in photography is the portrait.
You meet people, you meet, you bring together fate with people you sometimes don't even know, or who just want a few minutes to photograph.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.
The exhibition with Flamenco-people address selected from the portraits of contemporary flamenco will be held in the El Photomata Gallery in parallel with Alameda de Hércules until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he works on is "prepared bravery"
The scene and the act are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on writing his new novel. The novel's principal character is an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who lived in Congo and Amazonia for 20 years.
The official Nobel Prize was also a potential writer yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia event who admitted that his current work was "prepared blindness" and "all signs indicate that it should not be written" the novel.
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it, and I hope I can do it sometime" - he closed his presentation with these words at the festival of ideas, thought and opinion exchanges, which received hundreds of writers, historians and journalists in Aqueduct for four days, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of "Current and Dogs" was one of the most outstanding participants in the literature's holiday, and he added the hopes.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' "Our Friend of Neighbourhood."
After halfix Romeo's greeting, the audience welcomed the clock, in which the authors of the audience were shortly occupied with the amazing memorial ability of the Peru writer and a large amount of humor, how he had developed the special adventure of his reading passion and the desire to live life; how he was reassured with the disciplined writing method, busy documentation, many repairs and rewriting; how he had influenced his writers Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what his stories are built.
The Latin American novel acknowledged that it was impossible to measure or demonstrate whether books change our lives, but added: "I don't think literature is merely amusing or a mysafag-life experience," because it has an effect on people and making them think, so he asked the writers not to allow them to tempt them and bear their responsibility for their calling.
Because of the weather of the stepmother, the farewell of Pozoblanco is shorter, the horsemen's bicavidals are shorter.
The traditionally organized horsemen's bulls in Pozoblanco's holidays were deleted from the show yesterday morning after the future horsemen's torques found the arena field inappropriate for the battle.
As a result, the Committee agreed with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to miss the bull.
The weather reverses have thoroughly ripped the celebration series, since two of the three events could not be held.
He left on Saturday because of the rain with the second bull.
The future main players, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautist Castilblancho would have fought bulls.
So they only had a bullfight on Friday.
The winner, Daniel Luque, took three ears home as a trophy, and he was taken on his shoulder after the sophisticated and aesthetic struggle.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante’s two bulls gave many respects and ears as trophies, but he was more of a public than his own performance.
After that, however, El Juli followed, who contributed little to the aging of the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable round with the second bull, most of the audience was able to get out of the row.
In sleep, a two-two-toned abdominal truck tried to escape from road control.
Four o'clock in the morning, 50 minutes.
Bask County Police is conducting traffic control in Armiñón (Álava) administrative territory.
The authority stops a van in which two passengers are travelling, and passengers are trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tonnes of abdominals, but it wasn't noticeable.
The detectives picked up passengers, and one of them was arrested by a 28-year-old man, and A. A. J. was identified by the Basque Government's Home Affairs Department.
The man in custody is accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting.
The case occurred in Armiñón's administrative area where the employees of Álawai Round Control carried out traffic control on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave me gas and then left the location of the check.
The detectives picked him up and then the vehicle stopped a few kilometers from the station, and his passengers escaped from the motorway to a forestly area.
Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after reviewing the Iveco Daily branded van, he booked its shipment of 2178 kilograms abdominal.
Abdominals filling the back part of the vehicle have been deployed by the police to carry out a more thorough investigation and to measure the drug.
In addition, the inspection has shown that the fake plate of the vehicle does not match the information contained in the papers of the van, and that is why the arrested person is also subject to a proceeding for a public document for counterfeiting.
The Basque Regional Police continues the investigation with the aim of arresting the other suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, escaped the motorway, on the other hand, to determine the origin of the busy drug.
The 28-year-old accused A.A.J. was transported to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and the court measures were also initiated within a few hours.
He was arrested by an actress Heather Locklear because he was driving under the influence of the medicine.
Actor Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by the police in Santa Barbara (California) during the weekend because he was driving under the influence of the medicine.
According to a witness, he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange manoeuvres, a spokesman of the People's magazine in California on traffic control.
According to the witness, at 16:00 30, Locklear pushed the gas to the bay, blew the engine, tried to leave the parking lot forward and backwards, and went through the sunglasses several times in the back.
Shortly afterward, the witness who probably didn't recognize the actress first saw Locklear stopping on a nearby motorway and getting out of the car.
He also called the police because he was worried about Locklear's life.
When the police arrived, the actor sat in his car, which partially paralyzed the road traffic.
"It seemed like Zavart," which is why the police took him to a specialised centre for drug and alcohol investigations.
According to a police speaker, the actress was a co-operative and alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded, and the speaker also said that, based on the first impression of the officers, they thought that Locklear was under the influence of the medicine.
Locklear was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug.
Locklear came out two months ago from an Arizona Sanator where his anxiety and depression were treated.
Lamazares calls on the IU (United Left) andaloúz Federation to take care of the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary General of the IU and the United Left today stated that the regional federation of the Facility will decide on the case of the Seville Municipal Council of Youth and Sports in Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva renounced last week after accused of misrepresenting his position to give advantage to his family members.
"In these things, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this case really belongs to the competence of the Andarus organization," Lamazares pointed out the procedure to be applied by the party against the former member of the City Council in Seville.
On the other hand, the President of the IU underlined that in the discovery of irregularities that Silva may have done, "acceptability" should be kept in mind: "The IU has always taken a plane in addition to the maximum transparency of such cases."
He added that it was part of the training "the strict ethical code for public staff."
"May blood", the epic formation of Garci
Benito Pérez Galdos National Epizódok inspired José Luis Garci, who reiterates the famous revelation of the Spanish anti-Frank in the May blood, which is the greatest formation of his filmography with a budget of almost EUR 15 million.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the human flows and social analysis he has always admired in the work of a well-known novel. This is what Garci told the audience of the actress at the film show in Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría today.
The more than two and a half-hour May blood is presented in the movies on Friday, and later Telemadrid will be presented as a mini series in more than four hours.
The great admirer of José Luis Garci, Galdos' literature, made his childhood dream with this illustration. All this thanks to Esperanza Aguirrra, because he trusted the Madrid Land three years ago to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid of May. Garci accepted the request with the condition that the foundation of the story could be given by the National Epizodes.
The 15-million budget was fully financed by the Madrid Autonomous Province and it was a special opportunity for Garci: he could show "the disrupted Spanish, who joined the wrong leader, because he forced the country into a huge failure to fight for independence with the rule of Ferdinand VII." said.
However, the director expressed his regret that the budget of the fantoms of Alatriste or Goya who kicked the Mayan blood more than double was not able to count, and therefore it was forced to skip some of the scenes from the script, which - as many other occasions - will be recorded together with Horacio Valcárcell.
So Casting didn't work on the usual work method for the director of the reintroduction, he took the scenes with the actors he'd started the experiments before the shooting. Because Garci thought it was a rehabilitator, and because, as he said, "the directorship is part of the theatre and the cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we're working on."
More actors in May's blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not first step up to his camera.
Garci - who may be proud of four Oscars and an Oscar Prize - believes that before the Hollywood Academy, the Spanish candidates, i.e. the May blood, the seven French biliary bars and none of the Vak sunflowers who have finally entered, represents the young generation of the Spanish cinema, "where it should be presented" - said.
Garci's film doesn't count awards.
"In this case, you think you're working for the posterity, and then you'll realize that only happiness matters, and then you'll be happy to have another film ready", says Garci with a 30-year-old career behind her back.
Isabel Bayon remembers the life and art of Seville's dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer in Seville makes me remember a dancer in Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, born in the Triana district and moved to London with three-year-old parents, from the Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and and andaluúz mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela).
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern Dancing.
During his busy life he fought as a pioneer for female equitence, whether Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and he fought against the wear of a contraceptive to women's freedom of movement.
He exploded dancing and aesthetic revolution in war in Europe, and his life crawled Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gambo, and he gave me the attention to Tortola, whose personality was really impressed."
The flamenco dancer said: "It's not our goal to tell the story of his life, but to capture his soul.
I remembered flamenco styles from the titles of his dances.
For example, about the "snake dance" to guaji, or the "snake dance" to the tango.
"She danced in a sense, and others say that's my style," he tells me.
Two of the most incredible actors highlight the presentation: Miguel Poveda is now singing again after the opening door on Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, wanted to work with an earlier student.
"Matilde makes the older Tórtola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the request, it's very honorable to play in my play."
In addition, Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga music directors and guitars, Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón singers; El Pajaro batt, Rafa El Viola, and Juanfr Juárez, who plays "the permanent character that keeps his love."
The piece also presents a large part the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and then it reaches even remote landscapes, including India, the United States or Italy.
"I wanted to remind him, because his personality had a great impact on his own age, but they don't know him anymore, and even less appreciate his employee," says Bayon.
The performance will start tonight at 20:00 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, the "One recently married poet's diary" appears.
The first illustrated edition of a recent poet's journal will be presented in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where in May 1916 Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia. The presentation is part of the programme titled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008), organised by the Culture Committee of the Andalúz Regional Government on the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize of the Office and the anniversary of the death of the two of them.
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the final edition of this work, the International Congress held in New York, the restoration of the Nobel poetry monument and the "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The bright summer tree" exhibition. The exhibition opened in May this year by several Andaluz provinces and was planned to visit New York to the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andaluz Regional Government has gained eight hundred copies of the journal of a newly married poet named Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso to promote the reputation and work of one of the most popular poets.
Without Paul Newman, it's not that attractive America.
"God sometimes creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was like this."
The quote comes from an actress Sally Field who worked with Newman in a film called the victims of sensation, and reflects the shock and inevitability that Newman's death in the American cinema and the whole of America.
It's just how hard he got Oscar.
revoked in 2007,
and he was well-knownly ill,
But he's still arranged for everyone to die.
"Sometimes it is impossible to express our feelings, and I've lost a good friend," said Robert Redford, "he has made life better and this country better."
No one was afraid it might become ridiculous or overwhelming.
One of the cinema and home's heroes went into a particularly dark period, which was covered by the fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When there are such difficult times and many people are easily losing their virtues and very few people we can look up, we don't have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, he has physically incorporated plátóan ideals of beauty and justice.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and a protector of lost and winning matters, starting from the anti-drug foundation created in the memory of his first-born son who died in drug extinction to create a domestic bio-food farm.
It was a real gift to a country that could hardly overcome his own diet culture.
The shining admiration wave went to Hollywood without regard to nationalities and origin.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, says it's not a man, it's an age that died with him.
Another English, Oscar awarder, Sam Mendes, said that his joint work with Newmann was clearly the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, a bad boy from Australia, called Newman the greatest inspiration.
George Clooney, who may be one of the few who are attempting to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle today, has determined the integrity of honesty and the private life away from serious and cameras.
It's not always easy if it's even possible in the middle of today's media jungle.
Still, there are people who try and Paul Newman's role model.
He was divorced once, but then he lived faithfully with Joanne Woodward for fifty years, and he would certainly have had many opportunities for infidelity.
"Why are they eating hamburgers somewhere else when the meat comes home?" he was joking.
In heaven, you may be proud to be fans of your daughters on earth, which is not very common in America.
"One of all his works was not as proud as the faithful husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and the devoted human friendly roles", they tell us.
The hot way to the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream a Madrid Olympics, and after 2012 failed, it might become 2016.
But, I'm asking if we're really ready for it?
Because if we're off the race last night, I don't think so.
They called it a perfect race, but I see it was the worst of all that I've ever been.
It was characterized by a bundle of inappropriate inconsistencies, and if it were to be evaluated once, and I would be the exam, the result would be clearly faded.
Let's go in line and start at the beginning.
The insignificantities began by taking the number, because they had to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go sooner, at least get everything at the same time (including the chip, to avoid posture).
That's not what happened.
First, only the number was given (the first meaninglessness, only to go there sooner) and (after the usual position), as surprising, only the S T-shirt (the second meaninglessness, because I have the size of XL)!
What world are we living in?
Or because of the crisis, did they decide to save the material and just buy cheaper, small T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still sweeping from the day of the race.
In addition to the terrible early to take over the chip, the position in line lasted 15 minutes from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be handed down.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the competition started, and we haven't dropped the backpack yet, and when we finally did it, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain has made it even more pleasant for more than 40 minutes of expectation, designed by attempts to raise people and stand-in.
I think we'll get about 500 sure lung infections by tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, not our actual time, because I assume my chip has incorrectly fixed the start.
If they asked me about the perfect race, I wouldn't happen to think of that.
So I think we can keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft (virtual) is searching for reception
At the MIT Initiative Technologies Conference, Microsoft has introduced a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence that is capable of performing some basic tasks. For example, Microsoft can call a taxi (or a vehicle transporting in the company's territory) based on the information that has been heard from the conversation.
This "receptional" means a camera and a format and facial recognition system to identify how many people in the room they - and even, you remember what clothes they wear - and hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
In addition, you can group the presents on the basis of discussions.
On the video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but he knows he's not a member of the company that's talking to him, and he's not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she came to see someone and made sure she'd be able to help her soon.
It's all without the blue screen.
Impressive.
But this is, of course, the music of the future.
At the moment, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot of people in this week said that the Microsoft strategy changed.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contains less accompanying programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if the computers were running the necessary programs instead of all the commercial garbage, the machines would be five times faster - bravó, Steve, that's something.
They invented the Spanish message, given that Microsoft has been connected to Windows in all new versions.
The change of directions will be reversed.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly needed, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I also joined the theory that this Google made the first step to become a Windows competitor.
Many have rightly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element for dialogue between hardware and software.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to tell his mother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it will have to be counted by the "death" of the operating system, not absolute, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this thought.
People get less and less attention to the operating system and more and more on the web browser.
The computer is only switched on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more time to browse than the time we spend in the world of windows.
What is the use of a large number of apps with the system then?
Less sometimes more.
And Windows 7 is less, much less than Vista.
It's less difficult, less depressed, less complicated.
Microsoft's goal is to integrate its services on-line and eventually to report an alternative to Google.
They're all very necessary, I'll give you an example of why.
This photo was taken at the beginning of the month in Redmond, a contact with Microsoft employees.
On the souvenir machine, he calls a poster to use the company's browser.
In 2006, an independent investigation found that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google for Internet browsers.
By the way, last week, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has also been reported slipping.
Not at the beginning of 2009, it arrives at the end, in fact, in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to throw Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 on a joint market.
After all, the mobile phone would increasingly function as a computer.
But the slide, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, they'll definitely ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This was what Pablo Picasso wore in the Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick's Véres diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Crossfail, as well as one of the basic costumes of the gay shopping audience.
And while we're on the list of specialities, we can even remember the peace figure of the man of the wandering circus chicky chicky chicky.
But what are we talking about?
I mean, the "tank", as the English lips call it, but no competitor with Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, because of the elegant name, although friends are only mentioned as "Marcel", which is due to sports, legend is that Marcel Cerdan was named by the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, unisex custom, special symbol, and the small (also recognized) Belgian flag also shows its competitors. This is the most characteristic models hidden in the neck of the T-shirt.
But the Belgian company does not just make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, casmir cardinals, wool pants, seafoots, babes, mini-lines - and we could still be listed - are all of the company's products.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
Although it is regrettable that they should be wearing their underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I'd love to be a young mother; no matter who the father will be."
It's very similar to your brother, but at the same time it's accomplished itself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but it's full of energy.
At the moment, Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the world of fashion.
For Monica, modeling means much more than giving some pretty and beautiful girls his name to something.
He was present at the promotion of the new Paris headquarters of Mango and the most strongly sponsored by the Spanish company.
It's hot and gentle.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We present Mango's new autumn and winter collection that my brother and Penélopa were planning, and we also participate in the publication of the second 'Mango Fashion Awards' offer and the galaxy of Valentino in the Opera.
It's a dense day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at the Mango Company.
We both love the movies in the '50s and '60s; we've taken a lot of it from there.
And then, a lot of times I'm just going to go to town and watch women dress, dress and pick their clothes together - that's my favorite time.
You work as a dancer, an actress, and a fashion designer.
That's what I think, but at the end of the day, these three things are connected, because they have a lot in common.
I was interested in clothes when I was a kid. I was looking forward to going to my grandmother's house and sneaking in my aunt's locker.
Now, you were the Canaan, almost got up with a cheerleader.
And then as a dancer, I always tried to listen to my dressing.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for lessons and rehearsals to have a good time looking into the mirror.
And in the actress role, you really match your role when you get the costume.
You see, it's all connected to everything, and all my respect for designers and professionals.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than I've ever been, I love the 30s.
I think women are really worth it, they're already experienced enough, and they're making less mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't worry.
Ever since I was a kid, I've done what I want to do, and it's filled me with great inner happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother because I was born like this as a woman, actually, I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
And as far as the future father is concerned, no matter who it is.
I'd like to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movies, and last year, you've been shooting more movies that they haven't even introduced.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and unhappy, want everything right away, but I know it's impossible.
I can't wait to show you the last hour and the search for the grave of Christ.
I wonder how you guys feel about them.
I'm sure you've been decorated a few days ago with Naomi Campbell on the runway.
Oh, no, that's not true.
I didn't go on the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and he simply invited me to London for a charity fashion show for his own organization named women for a better world. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The outlined clothes were auctioned, and the amount was offered to Naomi NGO.
People don't even know how kind of Naomi is.
I know so much about it, and I can assure you that half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look at the right side of his activity.
He asked me for a noble case for the fashion show, but if he wanted me to stand on the head, I'll do that.
If the fate of women living in the third world is bet, I don't know the impossible.
Recessive drunken drivers will be required to install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior would require a vehicle to be installed in a structure that would prevent the start of the vehicle if the driver was in a drinking condition or would not blow into the structure.
The proposal was submitted in June and is currently dealt with by the Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which the pilot project will take one year.
As the project aims at re-marketing, the carman will also have to take part in a repeated transport education course.
In addition to the DGT, DGT and the FITSA Foundation are involved in the experiment.
According to the statistics, 30-75% of the cars arrested several times because of drinking driving.
Alcolock would stop this because the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air that is blown into it. If it's higher than the permitted, or if the driver didn't blow into the device at all, the system would not allow the car to start.
The cost of an instrument of more than 1000 euros would be the burden of an offender.
A related study in the United States of America showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of irregularities by up to 65% in the first year of installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could save their lives every year.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent crime from becoming a crime,
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce, as the implementation of the legal reform is carried out in the ordinary context, while the necessary reform of criminal matters would require a fundamental change in law.
The instrument is not available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although in experimental mode some industrial and public service vehicles have already been installed.
The Parliament will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Works Party, which, in French, urges the installation of the system in school buses.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
With English accuracy, at 17:00 a.m. at the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City, the Spanish Air Force was delivered by the Asturiasi Princes Party.
The sun was already on the ground, but it was so fired that only when we were using our hands as an eyewitness, we saw the royal party coming out of the plane.
On the foot of the stairs there were Spanish ambassadors and other ranked personalities.
A few hours before I asked a cab driver if he knew that the Spanish Princess would come to the city for an official visit.
Well, that's great.
No, no, sir, the lady in Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or so...
But the Mexican press, and then he knows everything about the Asturiasi Princess Party and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting for the red carpet of the airport hangar, by the 27 marine soldiers, who provide the protection of dignity.
The Prince, smiled, sea blue dressed, and then the Princess, puts the wind in his long hair, in a backed dress, but not in the usual toes flashing shoes, may have been warned that Mexico City is threatened by a storm.
They stop and smile at cameras for a moment, then enter the room where the official bet is followed.
In the gate of their hotel - one of the four largest hotels in the city - is a reporter of the mexican television.
The most valuable fashion prize
The best place in the world for the transfer of a fashion prize is definitely Paris, and the most sophisticated and undoubtedly Valentino of today's fashion designers.
Mango recently announced the second tender for El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims at international training for the young talents of the fashion industry.
The main prize is EUR 300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, Belgian winner of the first tender, saw his own design clothes in Mango's display under 54 in the boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and at a very low level he was relieved of its impact.
Besides, this is the second largest European business of the company and recently opened at 1335 square meters.
The biggest business is in London.
In the meantime, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner in the Paris Garnier Opera, which was intended for Valentino, in the midst of the thanksgivings for the chair of the jury.
In the finest Chagalos, the presidential table made by Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, his brother, who came with a heavy heart and sadness because of his recent death, wore one of the company's pieces and some of ELAH's breathtaking jewelry.
Andik, Mango's owner and host had fun with the guests.
Monica Cruz came to the store in his own design pants and shirts, and he wore a sexy long black dress at dinner.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace visit, but before he showed some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning in Oliver Martinez, we could love it - he will be two metres tall and bike - and John Travolta arrived at the Paris Intercontinental hotel. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he said in good advance that he wouldn't ask for any odours.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress count
It's not 1,000, it's 1,000, and there's one way to turn it off from the chaotic and messy usuals.
More good news is that we can find them all in a single book that arrives in the bookstore on 30 September to bring peace with you.
It's almost awkward at 7:00 in the morning, but it's even worse to think what accelerated life forces the day every day the world today.
The office's name is tension, and the computer's back pain.
Stress is the genocide of the 21st century.
But to overcome daily exhaustion and to overcome problems at work are not one and not two ways.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in his book so that everyone can find a solution to the most comfortable and free moments.
The stress-sold work bears the title of the 1001 relaxation method, and the calm from Pearson Alhambra y DK comes to the bookstores.
If you're convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this handbook will certainly squeeze it in his faith.
In addition, it also serves other ideas that help relaxation, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to prepare natural foods to 100%.
While your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and have become the central problem of stress life, it's time to retreat in the fotel, relax and focus on reading.
Those who speak in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think of those who are shaking up and completely alert about what happened to them that day, but about those who talk to them during sleep.
The phenomenon may first seem scary, but in fact it is completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
They must have told more of them that he spoke at night.
With regard to its frequency, it can be completely rapsodic (e.g. only one occasion occurs in a high fever disease) or more frequent (on a daily, weekly or monthly), and the child usually does not remember anything on the next day.
The display cannot be restored for a single start-up reason.
Often, other sleep disturbances, such as nightmares, nightrises, nightmares (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking are parallel, but this is not legal.
As we have mentioned, a condition with high fever, or a stress or increased excitement may also be accompanied by a condition.
However, it has been limited to this time.
The intensity of the speech is also very variable.
It may be quiet, calm, inconsistent words, morming, but it may also occur in the form of yelling, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to monitor the child and the specialist.
As has already been mentioned, it is a charming phenomenon, and therefore there is no cure unless it comes together with another form of sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. insomnia or stressed).
However, there are some things we can do:
Let's keep the child calm before sleep.
Let's choose reassuring games and avoid the child watching terrifying or aggressive TV shows or series.
Children who tend to be nervous or more relaxed are taught some relaxation methods to help them find internal peace.
This helps the child to sleep more calmly.
If you still start talking while you sleep, let's try to keep our peace.
Remember, this is harmless for the child, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Useful advice
Don't wake the child up.
It would be impossible because the child has no consciousness, but he'd be rushing me out of sleep.
Despite talking, he's actually sleeping and resting.
Do not forget if there is multiple severe anxiety that leads to the phenomenon, it is recommended that you turn to a specialist or find out what causes the child to have a lot of anxiety.
If you speak clearly (this rareest case), do not start asking them to know anything about him.
It would be worthwhile, because when you go to sleep it isn't so conscious that you can get your thoughts together.
On the other hand, you just hear the speech, but you do not see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of the heard and any conclusions.
Never tell the child they can question his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
It's a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is, don't worry, it's just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Finally, Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, Illhaeusern's team finally gained a new boost and rewinded on the home field.
Although there wasn't a wild game, the yellow-blacks got in many situations, one of which they finally managed to win.
The rate of match wasn't too tight because the attackers felt hard on the right rhythm.
The first door shot by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the remote ball just touched the top corner of the gate. Then the Illhaeusern came up and followed each other with the shots: Fonderflick tried a remote shot and then Hirn shot over the gate. Romain spicchiel and Diebold also tried to squeeze the protection of Dannemarie.
On the other side, players were protected by a block in the middle of the field and only the eternal mover Riahi was in a shooting position.
The beginning of the second halftime promised to be crucial: first Riahi and Temporale took place on the Dannemarie side. Right after the first shot of Diebold, the ball was brought out by illhaeuserni Marais, and then the gate gave it (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern's Golfman did not enjoy glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the course, so his teammates had to continue their struggle in human strength.
The Dannemarie, however, couldn't take advantage of it: there were no problems with the home team, who were just a little backwards to strengthen their protection. Only the last seconds kept some excitement when the ball got very close to the gate.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy puts an expedition to Bretagne.
On Monday, the demonstration held by fishermen has paralysed the traffic of several ports of Breton and Normann, so the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec at Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the demonstrators.
The latter promised that the President would be accepted in a "constructional spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with "concrete proposals".
The presidential visit is currently coinciding with the "crisis committee" meeting established by breton fishermen with a view to initiating action against the rise in the price of gas oil, since the oil price exceeded the average price of the 1,14 euros record per litre.
According to the President of the Republic, David Martinon, the President will "negotiate fishermen about what solutions would help companies to recover their competitiveness and make the seafarers more secure working conditions and hiring".
Fishermen are determined to wait for Nicolas Sarkozy to arrive.
Tuesday morning, traffic slowing demonstrations in Morbihan and Calvados were held in the county of Calvados, with nearly 10 km long distortions.
They also paralysed the transport of Quiberon yachts, but the roads towards Belle-île were not blocked.
The Quiberon peninsula has placed road blocks.
On Monday, seafarers have already witnessed their determination, and then in the morning, tyres and pallets were ignitioned in front of the tanks of the ports of Brest, while demonstrations were held in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic coast and La Manche. For example, in Sables d'Olonne, the Vendée county, the fishermen did not board the ship while in Le Havre, about 20 ships prevented the traffic of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in the county of Loire-Atlantique have at night eliminated the huge oil-refining block in Donges.
However, the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for a Wednesday meeting in the Ministry with a decision on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday its next step and participation at the meeting planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the Heads of the National Fisheries Committee, as the Committee has not supported their efforts.
"The strike continues," said Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, for example, was announced by "no way of traveling to Paris."
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes for gas oil are currently paying about 50 cents for litres, but they believe that the operation of a vessel would only become profitable if the price of gas oil would fall below EUR 0,30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
"Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" in Connecticut's home, when he was 83 years old, he died of cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have also shown their respect to the actor who died in the age of 83 and who was committed to his career in Paul Newman.
Embraer does not change its 2008 transport plans
Despite the crisis facing the global economy, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is planning to land 215 aircraft this year.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer company in the world, Embraer, is able to keep the plans, and in 2008, 215 aircraft landings - confirmed by Fredrico Fleury Curado, President of the company.
In the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian producer company is largely counting on the Chinese market, in particular in the case of 30-120 landing aircraft.
In the past eight years, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group Insurer, which has been recovered by the American financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets to pay back $85 billion for it, announced the Dominican edition of Financial Times.
In addition to its life insurance and American pension insurance activities at international level, AIG would choose from a large part of almost all other business sectors - the newspaper quoted the sources that are close to the case.
According to Times, the Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine the possibility of sales.
The AIG did not confirm this information.
The assets intended to be sold by AIG include the airline leasing company International Lease Financial Corp, the 59% share of the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, and its property portfolio and private capital investments, adds Times.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on sales.
The AIG must quickly access liquid assets to repay the 85 billion dollar loan approved by the US Government and thus risk whether it has to divide from 80% of its capital and loses its shareholders in an appropriate proportion.
The study of Paris Historique on the historic Morning Meeting meeting
The New York stock exchange reported a historical downturn on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (which never saw a decrease of nearly 800 points) and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) was sinking at 777,68 points, thus closing at 10 365.45 points.
The largest decline in the index (684.81 precise) was registered on 17 September 2001, when trade began again after the 11 September terrorist attack.
Nasdaq, mainly based on technology papers, was closed at 1 983,73 points, while Standard &amp; Poor's 500's expanded index decreased to 1 106,55 points according to official closure data.
The Wall Street stock exchange was weakened at the time of opening, and then the Senate unexpectedly rejected the banking rescue plan to restore market balance, started to fly deep.
Members rejected 228 'no' votes against 205 'yes' the funding requested by the Minister for Finance by Henry Paulson.
The plan was adopted by nearly two thirds of the Republicans.
"The market has turned down bad signs because Congress seems to be unable to approve a plan", thinks Lindsey Piegza, the FTN Financial analyst.
"It seems how much the market was expected for this plan," she added, and then expressed her concern that if a couple of days later adopted such a plan, it would be too late.
"If the plan is truly condemned to death (...), then on the Fed (American Central Bank - the Authority) and on the other central banks will be ordered to deal with the crisis and the credit conditions will continue to be tightened up" - warns Brian Bethune, the CEO of Global Insight.
Piegza adds that the sense of urgency is further enhanced, "every more and more financial institutions go bankrupt every day" in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking branches were purchased by its rival, the Citigroup.
The crisis has suddenly accelerated in Europe, which has made urgent measures necessary to rescue banks in the UK, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market is an FTN Financial analyst, not just an American crisis but a global crisis.
The bond market has been significantly viable.
The 10-year-old bond yield decreased from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday evening and fell from 4.357% on the previous day to 4.161%.
Obama won the first television match
The two American presidential candidates, followed his first debate again, which had to decide that John McCain or Barack Obama would be brought out of the battle as a winner.
Not surprisingly, both the Republican and Democrat campaign's responsibilities told themselves the victory in the television struggle followed by a third of the American households.
According to the political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's action was respectable, it was not sufficiently impressive to stop the decline in popularity: this is proven by surveys of five weeks before the presidential elections.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democrat is more a candidate in the fight: according to the results published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
In the most counting, even indefinite voters, 39% of the requested people believe that Obama will win, while 25% of them will win McCain's victory according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase its advantage with his party, Joseph Biden's promising to be great on Thursday. Biden's first and single public debate with Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned me this weekend, "I'd like to underestimate Palin.
He has good instincts.".
McCain's 70-year-olds never miss putting forward his own undeniably enormous foreign policy experience, but stresses the "naiveness" of his opponent on these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"It seems that Senator Obama doesn't understand that..."
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed for the presidential position," said McCain.
This is the main attack surface that has been used by the Republican television advertisements that have been running since yesterday.
However, Obama emphasised that he represents the future.
He didn't let himself get confused: he was confined and made up.
He stressed that he was able to make and restore the picture of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama already did," he cut back the democrat ad evoked this weekend, which puts the Republican leader's eye on the fact that he still hasn't measured the impact of the crisis on the U.S. end people.
"In the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday before twenty thousand people gathered in a shower rain in North Carolina for the constituent meeting.
Even the words "the middle class" or "workers" have not even dropped out of his mouth. The troubled situation in the financial world is undoubtedly favouring Obama, whom the Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy at the edge of the collapse.
"The next seven turning points may be", he said yesterday, the influential democrat senator Charles Schumer.
According to a veteran of the Clinton Government, a representative of Rahm Emanuel's democrat, Obama has "special instincts in the economy" such as Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the view of the candidate democrat, the current crisis is "the final judgment on the bad economic policy over the eight years created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain".
Senator Illinois reaffirmed that despite stock exchange fluctuations it will be able to reduce the tax burdens of 95% of the Americans, adding that its primary objectives include the creation of potential energy independence by using renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain is planning to create 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
However, both of the presidents carefully avoided the issues relating to the banking rescue plan of $700 billion (470 billion): the extremely unpopular plan was adopted last night by the Congress.
Minsk: "You noticed that there was a choice here?"
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday evening at the capital of Belarus to reject the expected results of parliamentary elections.
On Sunday nights, after the closure of the voting positions, hundreds of Belarus gathered on the main area of Minsk to prohibit the malfunctioning of the election results.
Although no results have yet been published, many young people protested against President Alexandr Lukasenko, saying, "Diktator, say no!".
Some people admit that they didn't even go to the vote: "Why would I go?" They do with the vote they want!" - says a young man.
Demonstrations do not believe that the regime, which has been in good shape before foreign observers, would be ready to change a democratic system in order to develop relations with the European Union.
If the election were to be considered clean by observers, the sanctions involving the country could be dissolved, in which 40 Belarusian leaders refused the visa and some bank accounts were frozen.
However, according to the opposition, the elections were not clean.
"We were kept from the electoral committees, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote counting," he regretted Jurij Potyemkin, who was organized from the twelve parties, thus a very heterogenic spokesman of the United Democrat Forces Coalition.
"The changes were purely nominal", highlights Alekszandr Milinkievics, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections and the leader of the Pro-European movement. "The point is to count the votes and, in our case, this executive power.
If the delegations of the opposition enter Parliament, that means that they have been appointed and not elected.
But their access to Parliament allows them to be placed on television, to meet in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore take the lead in political life because "a dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
Because if our severely debted economy against Russia is in a crisis and we are not able to renew, we risk being under the authority of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the outcome of the vote is accepted by the European Security and Cooperation Organisation following the electoral process.
It stresses that the participation rate seems too high and the wide organisation of the preliminary vote (26% of the electoral citizens participated in Minsk) allowed any manipulation.
"You noticed that there was a election here?" - asks the question, the head of the Social Democrat Alekszandr Kosulin, who was released last of August this year by the second of which he was arrested as a political prisoner.
No one has abstained in the voting positions.
And up to five opposition representatives will enter Parliament, namely those who are most in line with the leadership.
The silence of the night is going to fade again in October Square.
In television, President Lukasenko and members of the Central Election Committee will be delighted.
Blood's safe again
Ms. Francine Décary had a good reason for celebration because the Héma-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood tax companies in the world today.
And most importantly, it has succeeded in regaining people's confidence, which was severely affected by the scandal on infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As known, the national blood reserves treated by the Canadian Red Cross were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency symptomatic (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and general shock, the Canadian Government launched an official investigation in February 1994 by leading Judge Horace Krever, which was aimed at finding out the circumstances that led to the tragedy and making proposals to avoid similar incidents in the future.
While Judge Krever's late report was submitted, some provinces have set up a own committee aimed at designing a new blood management system for Canada.
The Gélineau Committee carried out this task in Québec.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood-protection services were established in Canada: one of the Héma-Québec, who serves Québece, and the other of all the other provinces and the Canadian Customer Society responsible for the supply of two territoriaries.
"When the Héma-Québec started its activity in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Québec's blood supply system" remembers Doctor Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the coming years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and of our work in the area, we managed to regain people's confidence." Décary proudly states that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the people in Québec considered the Héma-Québec to be reliable.
Décary, however, does not forget that "confidence is extremely fragile".
Since the establishment of Héma-Québec on 28 September 1998, he has applied the principle of caution.
During this period, a number of cases have been discovered in Europe when the fertility disease, i.e. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, has also been infected, tells the doctor, who has been running the company since the start of 1998.
"We didn't know if this disease was spreading through blood.
This is why we rely on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which, if we are uncertain and there is a risk of serious disease, then we must take out measures which are excluded. In this case, it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease that causes brain changes and thus inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from persons who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And for a few years, it was clear that the disease was spreading through blood.
This case convinced us that it was sense to apply the principle of caution."
In 1999, there was a technology on the market that enables a much more sensitive diagnosis of HIV virus. This is the nuclein acid test (NAT) that can directly detect the virus in the blood of blood taxes and not antibodies that are antibodies against the virus that were based on previously used tests.
With the NAT test, we could shorten the window perimeter, which will keep the virus from infection until we can show it in the blood by means of our technical tools - explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to a shorter period than one week.
Thus, there was a significant reduction in the risk of the blood donors infecting the blood cell outside of our knowledge and that this could not be demonstrated.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through transfusion.
Today, the risk of getting someone infected with HIV virus is 12 million for one.
"That means that we should divide 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400-500 thousand blood products each year, it should be over 24 years to have an event like this and to have someone infected with HIV virus through a blood product.
I think that now anyone can accept or write blood transfusions to restore health - says the first leader of Héma-Québec.
"The challenge of the coming decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogens are getting into the system.
It only happened last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nilus virus, would enter the blood with insect stings.
That is why we must be constantly out of space", continued by Doctor Décary, and then stressed that, in addition to emergency supplies, Héma-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
"Aging the population also increases demands.
As anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also affects the stock of blood tax, as only 3% of the population in the network is able to deliver blood.
However, every healthy person at least 18 years of age may give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of the applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have visited a country where malaria destroys are not eligible for blood delivery for one year.
"That's the 3% reserve we have enough to satisfy the needs of the hospitals.
It's very rare we're running out of stocks.
However, we need to increase the number of blood taxes to the extent that existing ones grow old because they can no longer give blood after a while.
However, it is very difficult for people to convince them to give blood, but it is even more difficult to keep them and make them become regular taxes.
In this running world today, there's hardly one hour for a man to go to blood" - he regrets Francine Décary.
Hema-Québec, a farmer of $297 million annual budget, provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heartburns, eyeball tissues and leather tissues, which are used only for persons who have been severely burned.
These fabrics are analysed, transformed and frozen, then placed at the Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public stem bank in Québec.
Only treatmentd as medical waste can be obtained from oesophageal cords that allow the treatment of progeny cells rich, including severe diseases (e.g. leukemia).
"Some weeks ago, we celebrated that we have entered our bank for the thousands of oak blood samples, and we plan to take more than a thousand new samples a year.
At the beginning of the next year, we are likely to start offering them for organ transplants" - Physician Décary, who believes that the pigeon blood collection program is very popular these days.
"So many mothers are sad because they don't have a chance to do this" - really, because Héma-Québec does not have a way to make this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Québec.
Football - in the pre-decision Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders yesterday at 3:1 at USL-1, and came into the predecision with a total of 4:3 results. This was the fourth-decision match of the second and crucial for the results of the Saputo stadium.
The final goal is Antonio Ribeiro's midwayer got the match in 90 minutes.
While the first half-time was gone without a goal, in the second two middle tracks of the montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino found in the opponent's net.
From the Sounders team alone, Roger Levesque managed to play Matt Jordan's gate.
Remember, the first match on Friday was the Impact 2:1 defeat from Starfire Complex in Tukwila, Seattle's suburbs.
Impact's playing with Vancouver Whitecaps in the predecessor.
Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder's team, pulled out from Whitecaps at 3:1, wins to 4:3, but the Whitecaps got in the predecision with a total of 5:4.
The Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches are still detailed today.
In Dióhéj - winner Kovalev goal
The Canadiens' favorite trias is ready for the next season.
The Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn formed three great attacks, and finally the Canadiens won against Florida Panthers 3:2 in probation shootings last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting got a goal. Plekanec two and Kovalev closed the match with a goalpass, which was the fourth victory from the six preparatory fights of the team.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who got the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warns the Russian player.
"I need another game to feel really shaped."
"He tried too much to get out of you in the first third," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think the outcome of the game was a pleasure.
He's got a huge ovation."
Northern ambitions of Charest
The Prime Minister does not rule that the election will begin this year.
The meeting of the Liberal Party was barely over, Jean Charest traveled to Jean-Talon in québeci yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) will win for the interim election today.
"Reduce our last great north border": this ambitious long-term goal was expressed by Jean Chares at the last meeting of the québeci Liberal Party in Lévis, which was also enriched with visual elements, while the President tried to focus on the point.
During his presentation, behind his back, there were similar images like Moulin à images.
The three giant recordings followed each other: the dams of water power plants, mine production, Québec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during the election periods.
By the way, the head of government at the press conference refused to guarantee that the election will no longer start this fall this fall, although he added that his schedule was very close.
The "good plan" for the fourth pillar is the "view of the future of the Prime Minister Québec", which will be composed of a "new economic area". This includes a Labour Convention to be concluded with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several conventions designed with Ontario.
Recently, the opening to the North (i.e. the North Pole at 49th Latitude) was often included in the Prime Minister’s speeches, but it has never been held on this subject.
However, the Head of State was merely striving to explain why the North was held as "a treasure mine full of great opportunities". However, he did not mention the timetable, investment amounts, or a specific order of importance for future projects.
Only a few development opportunities have been highlighted: in particular water plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which continues to stimulate the growth and reconstruction of state infrastructures in the blocking countries.
It is located on the north with "nique, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds" - named Chares.
This is the area "twice as much as France", "the territory of our territory, Québec.
It is not only in us but in us," reiterated the Head of State, stressing that it intends to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Québec's development was largely defined by the relationship with the North: the gold leaf in Abitib, the design work of the Québec, the Bay of James...
"This is our future, our future," he added, after a stage break, he looked at the giant map behind his back.
The North of Québec, which is 70% of the territory of Québec, includes part of Labrador, which Québec has always demanded himself - the Head of State declared at the press conference.
"This is our historical resolution, which has been confirmed by all the governments.
There is a border that has not been agreed for a long time, and if it comes to an opportunity, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government."
On the other hand, "we must also reconsider our view of the North", the Prime Minister said, talking about the north-western passport, which is opened every year as a result of the melting of the corner ice.
In the opinion of the Prime Minister, it is an important task to take the area in this new geopolitical environment.
And what about the natives, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister stated that the government of Québec pays particular attention to them and that the plan will benefit many people, especially young people.
The two ministers, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau, members of the various parties, were later sent to the Coast of Québécois, have already started the consultation with about thirty local communities.
It was also launched by the Interministerial Committee of Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (minister for transport and natural resources) plays an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", where "they create a common vision".
Northern development would otherwise be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly," promised the Prime Minister.
Jean Charest described this "visio" as in line with the ideas of the pre-liberal Prime Ministers.
"Just like the former liberals, we are thinking differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges."
This was, by the way, one of the topics of returning the weekend that began on Friday with the 50th anniversary of the Jean Lesage party.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois power plant be baptized as the dam of Adélard-Godbout.
"Our politicians, including Godbout founding Hydro-Québece, the quiet revolution and the national distribution of water plants, or Bourassa known as the father of the Gulf of James, all knew how to decorate the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he also quoted another - true, conservative - work, namely John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister "Roads to the North" between 1957 and 1963.
As regards the plan for Eastmain1a-Ruper's dam, President Charest stressed that the installation was planned for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I'm planning to be there," he told his calls, and he accepted his statement by a loud storm of applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no choice in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote in autumn this year, which is also possible by the law.
He stressed, however, that the calendar was already full because he took up duties at the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and at the Québec-New York Summit.
The party meeting at the end of the week has proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal President to develop nationalist decisions, which were almost approved without thinking, and this is particularly about the "imposition-related efforts": the Liberal Party, in particular, demands the recognition of the special character of the Québec in the Constitution.
I would also like Québec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunication Council, and these Members would have the right to take part in the decisions taken in Québec.
However, the opposition took skeptically the main points of the North Plan.
The Head of the Coast Québécois, Paulina Marois, reintroduced the North Qean Development Policy introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government in 2003 rejected the application of this policy.
If you hadn't done that, "we'd have been going a long way ahead", Marois said that in agreement with Mrs Françoise Mercure, who was launched as a candidate for today's vote in Jean-Talon.
The ADQ opposition party supports the Government's acceptance of the North Plan.
"We, however, want this not to be a mere act," said the leader of Sebastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, returning from his freedom today.
Letters - A Disappeared Country
Vic Toews, Minister of the Harper Cabinet (or the Minister of Justice), took the courage to call Louise Arbourt Canada "ashamed" last summer.
So to despise a woman who constantly fought for the truth and deserves all our admirations - that is very much about the people surrounded by the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, which has not delivered his own citizens home from the Guantanamo concentration camp in some of the Western countries concerned.
This is the government that absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when he was committed crimes.
This is the only government that, despite the signing of the Geneva Convention in Canada, has refused his word and has allowed a child soldier to float under inhuman circumstances.
The only government that makes a puppet theater of justice while examining the guilt of a defendant.
Let us just remember that the UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian lawyers also require Omar Khadr to be transported home so that they can have a fair trial in Canada.
And our government will look over the cake: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult has been completely destroyed even now, and all the years of torture may have sealed his destiny for life.
Although we are not aware of this, we are currently devastating our rights, freedom and democracy. "Democraticity": Harper constantly voices this word, which sounds just like an empty speech from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morals anymore: they can be spooked, tortured and imprisoned any Canadian citizen by the comfort of the leader of a government that was so far in minority (and what can be after 14 October...?).
Many constituents believe that the salvation can be found at a party that glorifies the Goodness, the Law and the Order. They do not see that this government has squeezed the values of the good news and dignity of our country.
Dear Mr Toews, the shame is more like this - don't look anywhere else.
Opinion - The Barrick Gold Orwell Vocabulary
A letter from Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Barrick Gold mine was published in Le Devoir's September 17th.
After Orwell's advocacy, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company launched a six-million-dollar sue against three authors and a small-funded publisher company in order to initiate a so-called 'public debate'.
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decision, especially in abuse proceedings, is not the truth, but the law.
It's not surprising that Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Would Barrick Gold really be the best way to be the public debate to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to?
Regardless of the outcome of the case, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada need to spend significant amounts on defending and fighting in an unequal fight where the army of lawyers supported by almost unfulfilled sources of the mining industry on the other side.
In this unequal struggle, however, the tactics are often used to destroy the defendant and make a friendly agreement that is not only to silence the opposite, but also to fear those who would try to deal with the question again.
If the Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have made his views known to the public.
Although in many other countries, where Barrick Gold operates, this happens differently, in Canada, the controversial parties usually do not hit each other with a stick, they say their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had enough to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in the press, media, publications, paying independent research groups that could have found light on the question.
But it seems that Barrick Gold doesn't trust the public opinion, and with a move, he miss requests and letters written in the protection of Noir Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how the "public" debate could be initiated if, at the same time, you ignored the opinion of this public?
In the head of the Vice-President, this word is probably just the lawyers paid in bus, and not the general dwelling of Canada: the meaning of the concept is thus very narrow.
In a democratic state, the freedom of speech deserves even other judges.
Barrick Gold, however, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that Noir Canada's authors and publishers are mainly supported by the public because it judges the rough procedure of the mine.
The public opinion is ready to listen to Barrick and to make judgments, but on the basis of civilized arguments, rather than by a trial for many. (In the context of the term "public debate", Barrick Gold has recently called on the authors of Noir Canada in writing to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to the surreal developments of Garver, the Barrick Gold procedure is launching an open attack on freedom of university research and seeking justice, which are building stones of all democratic society.
In the whole of the procedure, it denies the right to quote authentic resources, to debate facts and interpretations, which are the basis of spiritual activities.
If a country like Canada can only study and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of today’s world, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could be done in accordance with the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right to answer.
We have been able to deal with debates, differences and conflicts in our university range for a long time.
The unreasonable procedure of Barrick Gold shows that, unlike claiming, there is no interest in having an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public disputes in Canada, and it is now time for governments to finally take measures limiting legal procedures for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue - Democratics and Republicans agreed
The Republican and Democrat leaders of the Bush Government and the Congress finally agreed yesterday on the economic rescue action, which has been the largest in line since the great economic crisis in the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan to prevent the financial crisis on Wall Street for months must still be approved by the two houses of Congress.
Key points of the plan: Better monitoring of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds foreseen; new provisions to keep the number of houses occupied due to the absence of payments; access to the payment of the managers of the companies benefiting from assistance.
Mr. Henry Paulson, American Minister for Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the American Parliament, and Mr. Judd Gregg, the Republican representative in the trial, reported the good news yesterday a few minutes before midnight after the two-day marathon negotiations were over.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets," said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush Government.
"We have done everything to save real economy and American citizens from the current crisis in Wall Street", explained the Democrat.
"The most important aspect is that if we don't do this, then the shock, chaos, and confusion in the everyday lives of the Americans", said Judd Gregg, Republican representative.
Negotiation has been accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have an adverse effect on the mood of investors.
The stock exchange has given you a deadline for the agreement until the opening of this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations were willing to agree, however, they did not welcome the progress of the situation to the end.
Senator Barack Obama, Democrat, was attributed to the extension of the agreement with elements such as provisions relating to the maintenance of the household or payment of the heads of companies assisted by the State.
"When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary steps to ensure that other people are irresponsible, it is not a very pleasant thing.
These steps, however, are necessary," noted in an American television show.
And when the opponent, John McCaint, was asking if he'd vote on the proposed plan, he said, "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I have read in large lines is already seen as something that we all have to digest and through which we can move forward.
The possibility of not doing anything is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the 700 billion-dollar plan, taxpayers would buy doubtful demands from US financial institutions, something risked, unsaleable assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis that led to the collapse of risky mortgage credits (second mortgage loans) and then spread to other debt-indicating (trading) securities and ultimately caused the freezing of liquid resources and the fluctuation of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was failed by a group of Republican representatives last week.
We seem to have been stirred from this dead end since the democrats agreed that certain "toxic" tools of firms in difficulty should be guaranteed by the government rather than purchased.
In order to be satisfied with all members of the Congress, a provision has been included in the plan which requires that if the government has to bear losses for five years under the programme, it may impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a 250 billion dollars would first be paid; this could be followed by another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The remaining $ 350 billion payment should be approved by the Congress with a new vote.
In exchange for assistance, Washington will acquire a share in the supported companies, through which the profits can be dividended and sold after the crisis has collapsed.
The federal government will be able to delay the booking of mortgage loans covered by the plan, and it may also impose the maximum value of wages and disbursement to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The designers of the plan would like to vote on the plan today by the Parliamentary House and the Senate on Wednesday.
However, despite their forces, it is still not certain that the plan is approved.
As yesterday, the statements against the plan were repeated among both the Republicans and the democrats.
"It's absolutely clear that Washington won't hear your voice", announced the Republican Scott Garrett, who is a member of the Financial Committee of the House.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there isn't one that would benefit taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, a minor congress group leader, called the "sceptical group", shows things differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic experts, including three Nobel award scientists, wrote to us to ask the Congress: don't hurry and look carefully at which path you are going to choose", announced Sherman yesterday.
At the same moment in Europe, it was once again understood that this is a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux States announced that the Fortis banking group has a share of EUR 11.2 billion (EUR 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Belgian, the Netherlands and Luxembourg governments became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that he would not buy the bankruptcy competitor after losing EUR 2 million (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) due to the crisis in the United States of America's secondary mortgage loans.
With Fortis 85 thousand employees, one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurance companies.
"This money isn't thrown out," said Wouter Bos yesterday, Dutch Minister for Finance.
"In exchange, we have a right to vote and influence at the bank.
This is exactly what the depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain."
In the meantime, on the other side of La Manche, the British government seems to be preparing to state another bank that has been destroyed by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the total of the ongoing loans of Bradford and Bringley bank, of which real estate loans amount to £41 billion (75.5 billion U.S. dollars).
The Spanish Santander bank announced yesterday that they were going to buy the British bank's subsidiaries and clients.
The Bradford and Bringley after this Northern Rock would be the second bank that the British government has been trying to state since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Goodbye to the actress Service
According to some people, the eyes of the beautiful aure were the main bat cards, others said the main weakness.
Did you ever get rid of the mirror of the Nazarcis the American actor with a sad smile?
Yeah, I don't.
The disgrace, sensitivity, and her born talent also disgraced the stretch of the spirits of the true great monstrums of the art world.
But what a giant track he ran in!
Paul Newman died at the age of 83 in lung cancer on Friday at connecticuti's property, one of the last icons of the American cinema's time.
There was less monumental personality than Brando, who was compared to, and who for a long time was considered a competitor in the films. In her organs, she was more restraintable and undoubtedly vulnerable, but she also announced freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
There are often exceptional children from the blending of blood.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a German Jewish father and Hungarian mother’s children.
European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic forms of the American dream.
He didn't think too much about you, which just enhanced his merits.
In the early 1950s, Yale University's drama, then in the New York Actor's Studio, before he came into the theater, television and not much later in the movie world.
Besides being a live fighter of civil rights, in 1979 he reached a second place on the Le Mans 24-hour race. Besides, he was considered a sex symbol, although he had been happy in marriage with actor Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we will never find out what shadows he had on this mysterious, closed, job-involved actress's life, who hated the glowing of show-business, and that remains a mystery for ever.
He was honest, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked the cinema enthusiasts: in his big roles, we can only see in the black screen of memory.
The seventh American art has been struggling over the life of more than fifty years.
In our memory, the young man with the "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is a charming cowboya (1969) and the sentimental wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role we saw in Tennessee Williams' work in 1958.
From recent times (1990), in the image of sensitive Mr. Bridge, we can remember who, at the age of age, faces the fact that her marriage has not changed her hopes.
Paul Newman has also seen a lot of other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Free Up", the unforgettable formation in Rocky Graziano's role as a storm-lived criminal boxer, was originally intended for James Dean - and after his death - started Newman's actor career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work "The Great Fight", which won Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Robert Rossen's "The Svindler" brilliant film (1961) was designed by a desperate, revengeable billionaire player and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's "The Color of Money" film. In 1987, he received a single Oscar prize in nine marks.
Changeful times, but always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like this.
A change in ages was marked by the time of the run.
The younger ones are known mostly from George Roy Hill's Cultural Film (1977), where Reggie Dunlop is made up of a non-normal coach of the ice club team.
He was seen in the "The Great Jump" recorded by the Coen Brothers, but he was seen in 1994.
Sam Mendes' film "The Way of Damage" closed in 2003: the last one appeared in the role of an Irish Mafia Chief.
Unlike many cinema legends who left the movies relatively quickly, Newman remained in the light for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its shining, shining and imagination.
Bertrand Tavernier, French film director, not without all humours, thought that his game of subplay was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always merciful to the handsome Paul Newmann, who for a long time had just fallen into the face of film roles.
Yet, he played young and successful characters less often: he was more likely to regain the sense of society’s nerve disease, alcoholic, malicious or hopeless figures, for whom he was able to give back his drift and rebellion with perfect credibility.
As a ruler, Newman showed a less known face: in the depth of his soul, he was truly an eyewitness and sensitive man.
In the film "Rachel, Rachel" held in 1968 with the wife of Margaret Laurence’s Canadian writer’s novel, Joanne Woodward, drawing a fine portrait of a melancholic woman in the main role.
The "Harry and son" of 1984, with a film of repulsiveness and sadness, is a memory of his son, Scott, who died in drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman's undeserved actor remembered. His close friend and old warrior Robert Redford (with whom they played in "The Great Challenge" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid together") said, "Hey, his presence made my life and the world better."
The joy of generosity and being: this was the secret of this great actress's vibrating personality that we have just lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his comments about civil rights, the environment, the fight for independent film production and Hollywood's explosions are obsolete.
A lot of times we've seen his picture smiling on the packings of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods.
However, revenue from such sales has always been transferred to the Foundation for Children with Disease.
Newman never sat on his beans: he's been committed to his profession all the time.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: "Your father always and all the time was incredibly grateful for the star of luck.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It's also a privilege for us that we could go through the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a citizen, above all.
What were they producing in Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, 8 October, the trial against Zuschlag János and his associates will begin.
Political and associates are accused of fraud and other crimes, including illegal counterfeiting, which have been caused in particular by serious damage to the criminal organisation.
According to the Public Prosecutor, the successful tender funds have been used for their own purposes and the performance of the tasks has been proven in many cases by unreasonable accounts.
The public and municipal funds, totalling some HUF 65 million, have travelled into the Kassah of the Young Left, partly in the pockets of certain persons.
The method described by the investigating authority was that the tenders received were recorded on the basis of cost accounts that were not fully completed and the associations never complied with the undertaking.
According to the accusation, most of the accounts were fake.
For these, the charter blocks were acquired on the charter market, and the circulars were manufactured in Kiskunhala.
And what companies should be called account manufacturing, including on the Balaton-surface road to which János Zuschlag sent Lados István.
According to his recent statement, he had to look for pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice on his consumption there, and then he prepared accounts to be submitted to the applications of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, social and employment wallet and the Capital Municipality.
In most cases, István Lados noted these with her associate, Heritage, who, according to our information, wrote the most necessary reports to win the aid.
One of Lados' study guides was a beer house.
According to the two accounts issued by Zuschlags, in 2003, the restaurant provided a meal for the ninety members of the Association of Commissioner Pont.
However, they would not have been able to access the restaurant at the same time, according to the company manager.
Same way for the Better Future - later together with the Third Eighth Century - the Foundation was issued in the summer of 2002 by form and content errors.
A badacsonytomaji pension was only three rooms, and more than ten people couldn't sleep in one night, yet the account was about a hundred thirty guests.
But the fantastic form-loaders were overloaded even when they also marked Pigal Kft., whose accounting - according to the information provided to the defendant - did not include documents for the Better Future and Hoppa's name.
The head of the company, Wolf Winner, told Hvg.hu that when the D.A. was called in and presented to him, he knew immediately that it was about false documents.
"The stamp was in the wrong place of our company's name and tax number."
He added: In addition to the form, it was not appropriate that there were hundreds of people in the account, since they had a total of 11 rooms in which there are no such places.
Moreover, the account also called for a meal, while their restaurant isn't working long ago.
The inspiring account manufacturers did not follow the fact that the travel agency in Budapest looks only for foreign roads, so in botoru, a travel in Hungary was designated as a service on the cash account, which was also not agreed with the company’s accounting practice.
Furthermore, as the investigation has revealed, the VAT was included in the document, while travelling to non-EU countries was VAT-free.
Among others, the size of VAT was mistaken in the four documents issued by Hotel Rév Fülöp Kft. for the Right Future, since the company's service is not covered by the 25, but with 15 percent VAT, and the employees of the hotel only issued a machine account, while the account was handy.
In addition, the "outsourcing" account was damaged by the fact that a company has been designated a road freight transport as a carried out activity, which was found by the prosecution procedure, which was not carried out by the company based on the initial investment advisory.
Furthermore, the formal deviations - an inappropriate account format, not a real stamp - showed that together with the Third millennium Foundation, the XXI. Century Cultural Association and the Insurance Point account were false.
As for Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Camp in Kun proteins, whose representatives deny that they would have issued the accounts.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that the HIB Kft. was being eradicated at the time (2001) when the Young City Association had eaten at the time, and that is why the company’s winding-up officer, as we know it, also denyed that he had made the paper.
I've been made known.
Other groups of issuers are those who were aware of the need to issue a figurative account.
The Esély for Budapest Foundation issued an invoice for the Young Baloldal - Young Socialists at the request of the Threeth Eighth Century Foundation for some four million HUF.
The leader of the Collab Kft., according to the accusation, one of the defendants, was charged by George Ludovic to issue his figurative account.
He also cooperated with the Zuschlags with the current Biogate Kft., which in 2003 was founded by the Better Income Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Redfeny Association with roughly five million HUF of accounts, which were not behind the real economic activity.
No money movement, because the completed accounts were torn after, but the organizations have forgotten to include it in their documents.
The following groups of companies issuing the invoice are the ones that can be linked to the defendants.
Thus, in Budapest, the fuel and motor vehicle trade, although there is no place in Delta Trió Kft., Ukrainian Managing Officer, was Iván Kuubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several accounts on the sale of computer equipment, worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these accounts were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. Smallkunhalasi, which has been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
This company was an executive director of a Romanian man who would also have forwarded the company documents from 2002 to 2005.
We are aware that Cubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he issued an invoice on behalf of the Kft to Atlas, Hoppa and together to the Third millennium Foundation, and took their countermeasures.
Accordingly, at the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian stoneworkers founded the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually worked, which the defendant said was the reason they didn't get a job.
At the request of a lawyer at Zsolt, who is a defendant's associate, who also makes the papers of the company, he made accounts for the associations associated with Zuschlag on behalf of the companies: Atlas and Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Cubatov has issued 15 accounts, worth 14,2 million HUF.
The prosecutor believed that 10 percent of the amounts indicated in the accounts and the VAT hit Cubatov's mark.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. for figurative bills, and they were manufactured for the tender of the Sure Point.
The Y-Generation and the Association submitted an application for Modern Hungary in January 2006 to the Socialist Party's public benefit organization, the Foundation for Mihály Dance (TMA).
They also won HUF 500-500, but the amounts were not used for the purposes set out in the tender.
In order not to find out, five fictional accounts received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These invoices were found, by the way, during the search of Árpad Kemecsi in his office at the educational lounge.
A part of the defendants in the trial, as he did in the D.A., is likely to report on the course of the accounts.
The most interesting thing can be if you are the first accused, Zuschlag János, decides to appeal to everything.
His statement of this is not too detailed, and although he promised many times that he would speak extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is for this purpose, but for a large part of the damage, 50 million HUF in return, the socialists have made a deal with it, and Zusi will take the fall.
Whoever could have been offended today, since his requests for home custody to mitigate the circumstances of his detention were constantly found in deaf ears.
While the offenders of economic crimes that cause much more damage and do not reimburse them may walk freely or, at least in their own homes, expect the end of the proceedings against them, he will not have the opportunity to do so.
Psychology of overbringing: why are we selling more money?
In auctions, customers tend to release more money, overestimate the goods.
This well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior has developed the neurological-economy foundations for researchers from the University of New York, neurologic and economist.
According to their study in Science magazine, people do not want to go down in a kind of competition such as auctioning eBay, so they will pay too high prices.
The research attempted to map this "play" nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers has been lottery, another group has been auctioning, while using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method, the active brain areas of experimental individuals were examined.
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but during the auction game - in which the other party's overbidging is an essential element - the complex called the brain beneath the game was intensively operational when the game was lost.
This brain area plays a role in the mechanism of the nervous system 'supporting' involving several other functions.
Therefore, researchers believe that the price increase can be explained by avoiding the intense reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the research team’s economists also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this three groups bid against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group simply informed the real value of the product and made their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they get out of the game won, they'll be rewarding $15 more.
However, the third group received just $15 before the auction, but the members of the group lost this money in the event of a loss auction.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, only to one of them the profits and the loss for the other.
However, demonstrating the hypothesis of neurologics, the members of the "deceased" team were willing to make higher stakes than the control and the "fortune" group.
"These results cannot be deducted from any theory of an existing economy.
For the time being, they explained only the phenomenons in auction with the joy of victory and the avoidance of risk.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped to solve the contradiction between these two theories by now gaining a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we contact a doctor?
Around half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
The number of hepatitis-infected people here can be estimated at 100 000, but only seven thousand people are treated for which the patients often don't know that they're infected.
The name of the hepatitis is the collection name of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, typical of liver inflammation and yellowness, but their pathogens and caused diseases differ.
hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the nutrient channel (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body wets (swelling, vaginal, saliva).
Travellers should certainly be vaccinated against virus A and B, no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis Symptoms occur two to three weeks after infected food consumption, generally with malaise, weakness, abdominal disorder, nausea.
After this, the yellowness of the skin and the eye protein occurs, the faeces are clear, the urine becomes dark, healing may take two to three weeks.
A million people die worldwide in the more severe type of disease, hepatitis B liver cancers and liver muscles.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected receives pharmaceutical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may also lead to liver suppression, liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease because the pathogen destroys the liver cells underwhelmingly, in many cases the first symptoms occur only 20-30 years later.
Thus, early prevention, regular screening tests are very important.
In three groups, such diseases are much more than average: people who have passed blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattooed people.
The number of chronic hepatitis C virus infected is currently 200 million in the world.
As a routine laboratory study may indicate the disease, it is appropriate to contact your doctor if you notice any unidentified symptoms.
In time, recognising the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body so that the infectiousness is eliminated and cancer can be prevented.
On 30 September, the World Day of Hepatitis was organised first in 2004 by organisations representing patients worldwide.
It aims to draw attention to chronic liver inflammation, causes of development caused by viruses and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Whoever believes in God hurts less?
According to a recent study, religious faith works as a kind of painkiller, which could already facilitate the death of Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment, studied how divine faith affects people's feelings of pain, announced the British Telegraph.
As part of the fairly bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were involved in electroskies, while all studied paintings representing a Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out most of the pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, Catholics were also able to activate the part of their brains that were responsible for regulating pain.
The study is the first in a research series in which scientists, philosophers and theologians participate on different sides of the university.
The test was exactly as follows: a sparkling device was attached to the left hand of the test subject, which provided the electrocock.
The researchers asked the participants to look strongly at two paintings, the image of the Virgin Mary of the 17th century by Sassoferrato and Leonardo da Vinci with the Hermellin of the 15th century.
The authors of the study were hoping that the sight of Virgin Mary would create a religious state among believers, while the image of Da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and thought it was reassuring.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour on a MRI scanner machine, during this time they received 20 electroscopes in four consecutive parts while watching the religious topic or the general picture.
The Catholics reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary they felt "security" like "problemed" and "rested, peace filled them".
In view of the religious image, 12 percent of the pain was reported less than when Leonardo was seen before you.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who is involved in the study, thinks that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, including the atheists, only the right photo should be found.
"We should find a picture that feels very positive for someone like a mother or a father." said the psychologist.
Tom Wright Anglican Bishop welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should and in many cases will change our personality." -- he added Wright.
After the great results, the question is, if Leonardo or a similar calibre painter displays the image of a madonna to believers, how would that affect their pain control?
Would the sight of the high-quality Virgin Mary make even better results?
You're what you're sharing about yourself.
On the 10th birthday of Google, you can tell Google: you can find at least as much in your pocket as in your head over the sky; you know where you have holidays, what special orders you go and what you're interested in.
And that's still not enough Eric Schmidt, according to one of the company's main men.
However, as far as orwell's terrifying skeptics are concerned, they don't see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently announced to Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more personal data about its users, and this is necessary to keep themselves on the original goal of Google founders, which was to say, "We'll get all the world's information into the system".
According to the spoken Google leader, the company will continue to handle all the information even at the beginning after ten years of global reverse work.
What about five years later, Schmidt answered: "Wish Google could answer questions like "what to do tomorrow?" or "what work would actually fit me?" - but until then, software can't answer such simple questions because they can't answer the users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the exact recording of searchwords during online searches, the IP address they were looking for and the page interested have left after the search.
For example, through the personalized Search launched two years ago, users can store their own surfing background history, look back on what they were looking for, clicking on, and thus generate a much more personalised findings for them in the long term - the same logic will be based on the Recommendations that offer us products and services based on our earlier and fixed preferences.
What if they use my data against me if they look at what I'm dealing with? - they ask users who are worried about seeing the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, the size of the potential power represented by the company may be scary, not fear of guilt, punishment, liberty, but also rebelling against power in the Interneters.
However, it is confirmed that all the expressions requested are not only recorded but that they may be transferred to a third party, in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
This was perhaps the loudest example of the past few years, in which Google provided information on the orkut community site, which it reserved, about the pedofiles, which enables identification.
However, Internetists who were concerned about personal rights could even have been forced in May when the company successfully proved to the Court of Justice with the EFF electronic legal protection organisation: in other words, Google could not be forced by any other point of the Constitution to provide any information that the FBI has secretly requested.
(The federal government has successfully fought about fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of searches, which have been obtained by reference to the confirmation of the child protection law adopted in the past, but did not succeed in obtaining the individual users' search lists and obtaining a full website and keyword list covering two months.)
Google’s judgment is quite contradictory: those who keep their personal data from giving, because they feel that their intimate sphere and their private life are being used by Google’s services and conservative imaginary multi-companies who are presumed against them.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its inspiring computer fans, activists, users, sees the next generation of large companies, the "roading corporation" in them, in contrast to the rival, Microsoft for Windows as a world conqueror, as far as both fight for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not ask its users for an identification code other than Microsoft, does not ask for money for its applications, the open, free, constantly kept source codes and program packages are much more accessible, younger, cooler than the official software experience.
However, it may also be because the geek have a very problem with personal rights and the Internet, which is one of the most commonly voiced keywords in recent years, the web 2.0 has drawn behind them.
The web 2.0 is about nothing more than co-laboration, the intention of leaving traces and using the communication channels available to us, and while these levels change individually, the point is that we show ourselves.
A common young person can also lead a profile from Facebook to Xang, link them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm listing his musical habits, then they can all be linked to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, which can automatically show their latest photographic galleries on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can read a number of exemplary cases that illustrate: the girlfriend will easily find out the morning photos of the common friendly circle, seeing who she spent the evening with or fired a company's worker only because she writes her honest opinion on top management in her blog: a certain, private life concept has been completely reassessed for now.
Whoever lives online means what he shows himself, we can make a basic point behind today's young people's behavior.
If you want to hide something, or at least you want to avoid Google monopoly, you can do it (for example, using your Google search system, but not deliberately leaving a print with Scroogle).
For example, the number of people who do not register with purpose to avoid appealing to the social sites can be replaced by alternative versions that do not bind to giant server parks and which do not combine the best profile we have ever had.
The public opinion is not so secretly waiting for Google to show the protein of his teeth.
The company's current value of USD 156 billion is worth more than IBM (140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola (110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising interfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and the services introduced at an increasing rate cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but also to many other software developers.
Critical controversies, however, also find the counterparts affecting the worrying: for example, the upper management completely rejected the protest of employees, after raising the company's caregiver's fee to double, the company's management found it too costly for employees to eat a lot of daily meals, but it all disappears from the fact that Google was still driving a head before the Chinese Government in 2006 and under their agreement, the company's filtration of all the findings that infringe good taste and Chinese regimen interests.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds like they are not proposing a new service, only when it is already available, but surely, the problems of the coming months and years can move the world again: while some people believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project has been so sized that the company will soon have to face the Supreme Court of America, others are afraid of the Health system, while we can build a full health profile of ourselves with our previous discoveries, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can also provide good material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the popular Cory Doctorow’s novel, the Scroogled point orwelli, describes the future in which a person is alarmingly approachable only from Google’s data.
Two juveniles helped the dual killer in the trail.
Two juveniles were interviewed by the police in the case of a dual assassination in the occupied suspected they were assisted in the assassination of the crime trails - said the speaker of the Borsod County police chief assassination on Tuesday.
Young people recognized their burdens and are currently accusing them of crime.
According to the information provided by the MTI, two young girls are protected freely.
Criminal violence can also be punished with a loss of freedom for up to five years.
The suspect of the dual murder of the Root, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
It's designed for profit, suspected of crimes involving more than one man's murder.
The investigation revealed that the 23 - year - old young man owed a higher amount to a 53 - year - old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debts, so last Wednesday, the creditor was thrown to a place in the oyster, where he killed him, and then the man's 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was prepared to commit a crime, a sign of this is that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon at the scene.
The police are investigating the circumstances of the weapon and use by an expert involved.
Varso's stock exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague stock exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw stock exchange to buy a hundred-dollar stock package of the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by Poland despite the fact that the stock exchange in Warsaw was previously excluded from the new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
That's why the stock exchange in Warsaw is in public hands.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of the papers over a few months.
The new Czech Economic Day E15 knows that the Polish offer represents the highest amount that interested people have so far offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Belgian stock exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, the manager of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner and would not rule out that this would lead to the end of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the stock exchange is estimated at 5 to 10 billion kroons by market experts.
Under the agreement of the shareholders, about 90 percent of the papers could be sold.
The largest owner of the stock exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.r. 13.5 per cent.
From the perspective of European papers on the financial crisis
In their Tuesday comments on the growing international financial crisis, European papers will be mentioned "second September 11."
We thank the President of the United States of America for the global financial disaster, accusing La Repubblica in Rome, the President was not even able to list his own party behind the proposal for a law consolidated in his wound to remedy the desperate situation...
Again, instead of Pearl Harbor, mentioned by Warren Buffett's billionaire investor, it is more appropriate to talk about the second September 11.
A part of the Madridi press sees the crime bat in Washington.
According to El Mundo's view, the lack of political leadership there has led the world economy to the edge of the collapse.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and then the whole world will suffer.
However, Bush's plan was not perfect, but following the Congress vote, the threat is that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the biggest transformations in capitalism is happening.
The threat can no longer be ignored - shows the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still provide rescue support to support financial institutions today, and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy with their money.
However, if more banks doom like dominoshocks, neither funds nor further promptings will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to go beyond national self-esteem and to centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
Only on Monday, more than EUR 100 billion were received by the weakening financial institutions - reminds me of the Vienna Der Standard that the concerns that, like the Americans, European taxpayers need to touch their pockets deeply in order to cure the crisis.
The EU has not been seriously concerned with the crisis that sweeps through the old continent as a tsunami.
"Safeguards" will not need to be flagged up to EUR 100 billion, but it would be good to be recorded: in which case it is reasonable to go to taxpayers' money to prevent more damage.
The flight of the dongo is imprinted by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop collision-free technologies if not imitating barrier sensors in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented by the CEATEC in Japan, dongo bees gave the strategic starting idea of Nissan's engineers to build the next generation of conflict prevention systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the biodecorative autobot control system of type BR23C, a robotised miniature car, which was equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that eliminates all impacts.
During the flight, all bees create their own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our security protective shelf - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, the technology PR and research development brand.
Its role is important to the complex eyes of the bee, which can be seen in all directions in more than 300 degrees of vision.
To copy that complex eye function, engineers touched the laser telemeter idea.
This identifies the obstacles within the 180-degree vision space before BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into an operation to avoid impact.
During the crack of the second, there will be an detection of the obstacle and then the autobrobe, imitating the movements of the bee, changing the direction immediately by turning the wheels to avoid impact.
In any way different from the current system, this avoidance manoeuvre is done in a completely inspiring way.
"If this wasn't the case, the car robot would not respond fast enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Auto-robot project.
Incentively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most fragile and inner layer of safety shields, a layer within which the impact is currently considered to be inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must be under an eyelash.
However, in a different way from bees, the difference may not be directed upwards, downwards or throughwards, only two-dimensionals, and only in the direction of wheel rotation.
In this way, only rotation and acceleration were used and slowing the car robot as an option.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are easier and more density, meaning that their lifetime is longer than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, the instinctive intelligent reaction is an important, not the ability to process data, even less storage.
This device must process and respond to only a few input signals per second.
There is no need to maintain them and react with intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres, so he is constantly using only a few dozen kilobates of memory.
There's no need for gigabams or a memorial of the size of it.
This is the first step to develop technology for immediate avoidance, which, according to Nissan's estimate, can be involved in serial cars within 10 years.
Additional application may be possible for the unit to be integrated with the GPS satellite navigation system to drive the car to the specified end target by avoiding obstacles on the road.
He's got a name for the poisoned child.
The written version is prepared for the 700 billion dollars economic rescue package for the purchase of bad loans of banks in several detail.
In the first round, half the amount is spent.
According to the Eastern Coast, the Congress leaders were in the debate of the total $700 billion rescue package, which has been overnight, reported by the Reuters.
We have made a serious progress - reported by Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American Parliament, who believes that the agreement is only being put on paper.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said about the outcome of the compromise that the programme will work and work, but it will be necessary to do more. Pelosi says this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy's car.
A written version of the package was made public by the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday evening 8 (i.e. two hours of Monday morning) but did not cause a spectacular fluctuation in the stock market.
The draft legislation on the Act on Economic Emergency Stabilisation Act 2008 on the programme will first be voted by the Parliament on Monday and then on Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then they welcomed the news of the agreement at the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy - Tony Fratto, the spokesman of the White House.
By the way, the programme differs from the original proposal for Bush administration that would have spent $700 billion in one of the singles to buy high-quality, credit guaranteed securities.
At first time, up to half of the amount of 700 billion can be spent using 250 billion immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on Monday, this is what the Ministry of Finance buys of bad-classified securities, and another $100 billion will depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be checked by a separate body, which will be attended by the President of Federal Reserve.
The cost of the other half of the 700 billion depends on the new Congress decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may use a combination of tactics: it may at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and other types of "toxic" loans.
Buying in auctions and can happen directly - was announced by the competent authorities of the Ministry.
The legislation enables the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial wallet guarantees the means of worrying for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary instruments to provide up to $700 billion to the urgent needs of the American financial system, either to buy the widest of bad assets or to avoid a systemic risk with a collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as they sign it.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks waiting for State aid may expect the government to limit their exit money - which the overseas slang simply calls gold parachute.
Payments are limited only in certain cases, and the limits depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys in auction, the gold parachute is added unless the retired bank manager is retired.
When buying bad credits directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that managerial money is not overreacted.
The picture includes that the existing gold parachute contracts do not change, the restriction only applies to new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of directors - commented on the measure by the President of the Committee on Financial Services of the Parliament, Barney Frank of the Democrat Party.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State acquires the right to acquire shares, thus the risk of taxpayers is reduced, as they can eventually gain in the transaction as the economy and the rescued bank are recovering.
The draft law states that in the following five years the President must submit to the Congress a proposal which provides how to return the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides, there were people who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, i.e. not protecting the taxpayers' dollars - declared by the Republican representative of Darrell Issa in California.
A colleague of a democrat in Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believed that the same measures were urged to be responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices increased further
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1,1 per cent higher compared to July 2008, with a decrease of 3,9 per cent compared to one year earlier.
As a result of the domestic and export price change, industrial producer prices were 0,7 per cent in the previous month and 3,2 per cent in the previous year.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum compared to the previous month by 0.1 per cent.
In addition, domestic sales prices in the processing industry also increased slightly by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The largest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather product, foot production sector (2,8 %), mainly due to the monthly price increase of 4.6 % of bags, linen production and 2,5 % of foot production.
The higher price levels of plastics and chemicals resulted in significant monthly increases in the chemical, product manufacturing sector prices (1.6 per cent).
Price reductions occurred in oil processing (1.4 per cent), the production of electric machinery, instruments (0.9 per cent) and, to a minimum, wood processing (0.1 per cent) sectors.
Prices of paper production, publishers and printing activities have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, price increases between 0,2 per cent and 0.9 per cent were measured.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which represents a significant weight in domestic sales, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the overriding impact of the official gas price increase carried out from 1 July.
Twelve months in comparison with domestic sales of manufacturing industries, prices increased mostly in the petroleum processing sector (33.4 per cent).
The production of metal products in the sector was seen with an increase in prices of 13,2 per cent in food, drink and tobacco production representing a fixed weight.
Price reductions in textiles, textiles production (2.5%) and the production of electric machinery and instruments (0.3%) have occurred in the sectors.
The increase in prices in the other manufacturing sector was between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.
Over the last year, prices have increased by 10.2 per cent in the manufacturing industry as a whole.
The prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector were 18.7 per cent higher than one year earlier.
In August, the largest monthly increase in the prices of investment goods in the sectors concerned showed the domestic sales (0,7 %).
In the consumer products sector, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, and in the energy and further use sectors did not change compared to the previous month.
Compared to the same month of the previous year, the highest price increase was observed in the energy and forward-use sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer products sector, price increases of 6.8 per cent were measured at 1.4 per cent for investment goods.
The export sales prices of the industry in Forint increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, with a 12-month comparison of 3,9 per cent.
In a month, our domestic currency fell by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar, compared with August 2007, by 7.5 per cent, and by 15.9 per cent higher than the dollar.
You don't need a visa to the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance to enter into the American-Hungarian visa-free agreement on 12 January - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of local Hungarians.
In his view, "this is now well-depends only on whether the electronic entry and control system will be built out on time across the sea."
However, he pointed out that the new system does not have a permit to enter, but the tourists will have to register themselves before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Minister of Foreign Affairs Condoleezza Rice, who will be transferred to the Central Cross of the Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Hungary with the Foreign Policy Advisors of Barack Obama's Democrat Party and the Republic of John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are next to the rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates of the two great American parties, provided the government's 700 billion-dollar banking aid package on Sunday, but there is a politician demanding the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and the administration were reported on Sunday morning after the Marathon negotiations for days: they have concluded an agreement on the banking rescue package.
The crisis of Wall Street and the financial package to melt the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain also claim that it is more suitable than a competitor to take the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama has reapproached some of the benefits of McCain after the Republican convention, with the appointment of Vice-President Sarah Palin.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Law on a package of 700 billion would quickly be adopted by the Congress.
It stressed that the proposal contained consumer security passports that he also supported.
"We must now act with responsibility (...) for your job, savings, the entire industry, threaten the stability of the entire economy," said 35 thousand people.
He didn't miss calling McCain's economic ideas a long time ago.
McCain explained in the interview to ABC: "We will all find it hard to swallow it (...) but nothing's simply a way out."
The Republican Senator announced that the proposal included the setting-up of the Minister of Finance and the restriction of the final withdrawal of the top leaders.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no role to play in the negotiation, but he had a daily relationship with the minister.
Prime Minister Nancy Pelosi told me on Sunday that the Parliament would hopefully have voted on the draft law on Monday.
Lapland of the German linguistic area
The right-hand camp is unaffected, only within the camp, the voters became more self-conscious - so Der Spiegel analyses the weak role of the CSU in Bajoran.
Haider is ready to rule Austria to prevent red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
The article “The Revolution of the Bajoran Revolution of Franz Walter, ” of the German newsmagas on the left side analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politician, the erosion of the CSU started long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
For decades, Christian socialists have renewed Bajoran, and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The exchange of times is also the problem of Christian democracy, such as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for the CSU, but a process ended on Sunday, which was almost exactly ten years of probability: an undisputed hegemonia of a state party has ceased.
For 10 years, CSU landed 47.7 per cent in 1998, first in the 50s, below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so it was mentioned in the Stoiber age.
This is why the modernisation carried out consistently by the CSU in the province, which eats his parents.
Sociologists have been prophesiing this for 40 years, but they were mistaken in the pace. However, there could not have been consequences for the CSU of the voters' loyalty to the developing regions of Bajoran.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and there are political consequences.
The right-hand camp is unaffected, only within the camp, the voters became more self-conscious, more critical, more self-conscious.
It is also noteworthy that in the last weeks, the classic civilian groups have been most distant from CSU; they are free-employed, industrialists, graduates and higher-level graduates.
Here, CSU's support has shrinked by 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The article on Conservative Vienna Day entitled "Who, Who? The parties on the Backed Coalition issues" deals with the confusional internal policy situation after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The EVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ into its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens don't want to agree on the coalition.
The election has taken place, now everything is around the coalition; in the debate organised in public service television, the parties have barely allowed access to their cards.
President Werner Faymann, SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the EVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties - in some states and in the social partnership - is quite possible.
The question is, can you imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the ÖVP, as an alkancellor, has left Faymann open.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molter course has been voted for anyway.
The recurrence of this direction is not about.
Molterer responded carefully to the red offers.
As you said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to intervene in the OSCE.
To party the opposition or enter the coalition, the parties are currently fully open, the issues must be discussed within the EVP.
Jörg Haider BZÖ repeatedly appeared open to all directions.
"To prevent red-black coalition, we're ready to take responsibility for government," said Haider.
Vehicles: Breaking the evil circle of poverty, segregation
Today, the European Conference on Equality began in Paris, which is the host of France, representing the European Union's serial presidency this year.
Líbia Járóka, the fidessist representative of the European People's Party, has called attention to education segmentation as one of the main speakers of the professional negotiation, as this is also the most serious obstacle to the violation and enforcement of the Roma children.
The high-level conference, on behalf of the French Presidency, was opened by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The main representatives of governments, European social partners and European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities have been invited to discuss.
According to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, Járóka warned that, in addition to discrimination in employment, the Roma are mainly required from the labour market on the basis of their low level of education.
"The majority of Roma youths do not have a secondary degree, and due to low quality basic education, they can only have an insignificant degree of higher education."
Járóka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children can constitute a strengthening of the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the representative, it is necessary to inform these links in the broadest circle - including between Roma and non-roma.
As soon as the Roma student starts school, the chances of becoming productive members of the labour market are increasing; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid after income and consumption.
"The right of Roma to ensure their right to quality education and to ensure the eradication of their low-quality and separate education", highlighted Járóka Lívia.
According to the representative, the European Union's objective and action-oriented convergence is essential for the immediate acceleration of school deregregation processes and for the correct implementation of existing and planned anti-discriminatory directives is essential.
"We need to break the devil circle of poverty, segmentation, unemployment, and we need to give Roma children the opportunities of democratic space to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen", asked Járóka.
The European Equal Opportunities Cluster to be held every year since the last Berlin meeting, in the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Mercy for temporary time
At the end of October, they will decide on the double fate of Huber-Beckstein.
Despite the creepy election falls, the heads have not yet fallen, so far at the Bajor CSU's tops, the discussion of personal issues has been overlooked.
Parade Erwin Huber and Günther Beckstein County Head of State may still remain in place, questioning how long the mercy lasts.
In the last weekend of October, the 17% catastrophic loss tandem will be decided by an extraordinary congress.
A great deal of judged couples have been perceived: they do not hold on to all their strengths.
This attempt was made to calm the fracture and the mad members of the base, who demanded personal consequences one day after the "bajor tsunami" because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - true, even with the control of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his track - the Christian Social Union acquired 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the stoiber defeat, it ran only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was a "unit ruler" of 18% of German GDP in Bajoran.
Conservatives continue to be highly counted for the Hungarian economy in a central southern region, which will certainly be forced to coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of the inward reorganisation, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture will also be placed in the narrow investigation team, which will start with the liberal FDP and the Free Electors on the right-hand side side, on a possible Munich government coalition.
It's a strange sense of fate that he's getting into the law on the Free Electors list by the Gabriele Pauli whose action against Stoiber used as a pair of huber-Beckstein smugglers, and then he's treated unrestrictedly with the prominent local politician.
The CSU leaders are now turning all their energy into some way of stabilizing Beckstein.
Stoiber, the former Head of State and former President of the CSU, who has been calling the hardest day of the political career on 28 September, will also have an active role in the transition.
On Monday, Huber made some remarks to the CDU, he believes that they would have earned much more support from the brother-in-law.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel cannot be a Chancellor if CSU, which has a significant role in national success in 2005, is somehow not recovered.
Markl, which is difficult to conceal his fiasco disappointment, says that the loss of CSU soil will not negatively affect the Belgian large coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
The SPD has achieved the weakest result in Bajoran since 1946 by 18.6 percent.
Lukasenko-Official: 110-0
No opponent was able to enter the Belarusian Parliament following the Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of Alekszandr Lukasenko in the country, but according to the European Security and Cooperation Organisation (EBESC), by the irregularities in the process of voting.
The OSCE, sending 450 observers from 43 countries, did not accept the elections.
Although the 10 million-dollar country's ten-dollar law has made the opposition a long decade without opposition, before yesterday's elections, the United Nations Democrat Forces (ODSZ) had seriously hoped that Lukasenko, a quarterly renewing the Presidential mandate of the 2006 debated pure elections, would be allowed to appear in Parliament by some opponent representatives.
The U.S.O.S. has thus stopped the pre-balanced boikot.
In the context of opposition expectations, it was stated that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which has credited the constantly degrading Russian imports of natural gas and has contributed to the introduction of Beltransgaz into Russian hands of gas pipelines across the country - wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, where Lukasenko and several high-level politicians were not allowed entry permits due to the antidemocratic policy arrangement of Belarus.
Firstly, the EIB pointed out that, when assessing the election campaign, the EIB emphasised positive movements rather than shortcomings, such as the third of the opposition candidates.
However, the fast report of the OSCE on Monday has already objected to the campaign - in which the opposition candidates could not in essence appear in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not be present in the recording of votes.
In addition, the opposition believes that there is still an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to take a smaller confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of South Ostetia and Abházia, which has broken down from Georgia, even though Russia - with which Belarus constitutes a federal state in paper - has considered two areas independent for a month ago.
- We have taken two steps forward, one behind, but the most important thing is that dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU - said to our newspaper Alekszandr Milinkevics.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to remain, despite the fact that "the power was frightened to allow an opponent to enter the weightless parliament".
The opposition does not intend to dismiss action in view of the results, rather to send a message on the need for economic reforms to the electorate.
- Of course, we have a lot of problems, and the opposition papers must be printed in Russia, leading to barriers to dissemination by the local authorities, but I can see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevics, pointing out that the regime of Lukasenko, which considers the main result of social security, even the layer of most officially supported pensioners, is not appropriate.
- The country's debt, due to the increase in the trade deficit, is a matter of time for the breakdown of social security, which calls for the graveyard's silence - said Milinkevics.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers classified the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebegyev, leading the mission of the Community of the Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosty, "not the words, but the actions," so the lack of opposition is evidence of the graduates of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Monday only before work."
In the history of Chigi Palota, unanimous rotating doors were installed for recruitment and entry of workers.
From this day on, this new measure will apply to the agents, to filter out those who block and then go get a coffee at work.
Renato Bruneta Minister of Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office, presented the novelty of the sunshine today.
"The twisted gates - said Brunetta - are used to work better and more efficiently, to reduce shortcomings and increase services"
"A new, more responsible and more transparent period will come.
This is the real reform" - stressed Brunetta.
With Chigi Palace, all the buildings of the Council of Ministers will be completed.
Masi says "the installation of the rotating caps is also of a symbolic importance".
The secretary-general confirmed that we had no resistance from the employees: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
There's no more coffee and brilliant.
Brunetta says, "A good capuccino at seven o'clock in the morning, she can do miracles"
At the University of Administration in Rome
At the hearing held, the Minister described: "in three months, 50 percent of the public sector's shortages due to the disease, which represents more than 600,000 employees in a year."
He added, however, that the Italian administration should be more efficient.
, "the wage dynamic of which, according to the Minister, has been twice as much as the private sector in the past 8 to 10 years, and has well exceeded the inflation rate."
However, thousands of public employees have gathered together, joining the submissions supported by the Italian Environment and Consumer Protection Association to object to the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"When the Minister of Administration boasts of data supporting the reduction of the deficiencies due to the disease, the war of the "wearless sunshine" continues to grow", writes the Consumer Protection Association.
Thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff in Italy have gathered to send wars to the illegal rules of the regulation."
The regional administrative court is attacked, inter alia, on the eradication of supplementary nutrient money for medical reasons, on the extension of the period of residence of workers at the sick leave, which means the period within which the patient visitor may appear, and on several other aspects of the new provisions required by the Minister.
Occupational accidents: According to Napolitano, prevention is more important than anything.
There are 2.500 accidents at work in Italy every day, with 3 deaths and 27 permanent disability.
According to the workplace accident insurance data, almost 1.200 deaths occurred in 2007.
The numbers testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death and demands almost twice as many victims as murder.
Today, Anmil will organise the day of victims of work accidents in all the counties of Italy, traditionally on the second Sunday of October, on the 58th occasion, to draw attention to this dramatic problem by the institutions, social organisations and public communications.
"The worrying data reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, are underlined that prevention plays a very important role in accidents at work", said President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to President of the National Association of the Balances of Workplace Rokkantak.
The Head of State honestly referred to the "consolidation's lasting commitment to preventing workers at work, protecting the interests of workers in the accident, helping family members of the victims and putting public opinions on the captivity".
"The tragedies of the media and the public's interest in the media and the public are caused by a natural and genuine confusion, but we must face dramatic, repeated and repeated events in reality every day."
Napolitano openly admits: "We are desperately struggling with the lack of resources, and financing education and information is crucial.
In particular, initiatives within the school are important to direct awareness of young people who are not able to enter the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to the importance of the issue of social importance and to obtain more effective legislation.
The President of the under house, Gianfranco Fini, stressed on his behalf, "the seriousness of the accidents in the workplace that are dying, the social importance of all of us, and the institutions are required to end this as soon as possible."
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of these types is still amazingly high," said Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmil.
"We do not want this decreasing trend to be duplicated, decreasingly, because the greatest tragedies occur when attention is lost."
"We believe that at general level we are still not doing everything we can to combat the phenomenon, which can be solved through a complex action programme.
In our view, stricter supervision and control should be required - emphasised by Mercandelli - and more stringent intervention in the field of labour training, starting from school education."
He added: "More efforts are needed to inform and dental public opinions".
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment against a phenomenon that is a problem at social level".
Mercandelli then criticised "the gradual deterioration of the compensation net for the victims of accidents at work" and the "aid direction towards which the system has drifted in recent years".
"The goal is therefore to give back the safety of the workers, because the destiny of the victims of the accident cannot depend on the lawmakers where they are self-restricted and where they are dividing."
Hallucinations may be caused by MP3 players
Obsolete hearing damage may be caused by listening to portable recording devices for longer and high volumes, such as MP3 devices -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, on the basis of the opinion made public today by the Scientific Committee on New and newly identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
"The opinion shows that 5 to 10 percent of permanent hearing damage may be caused by those who listen to their music player with high power over an hour per day for more than five years" is read in the explanation.
"It is worrying that young people who use high-power portable music players and mobile phones in mass and practice are unaware that they can irreversiblely damage their hearing", said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk that we need to respond urgently to," the EU Commissioner added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and widely disseminate information about them.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can operate and keep up with the latest technologies.'
Brussels invited the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the spread of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people involved in their noise.
"The European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and the stakeholders, is ready to examine the possible measures to be taken to protect children and young people who have been put into service by means of means of the means of transportable players and similar noise", said the member of the Committee.
The current European Security Regulation sets out in 100 dB the maximum level of noise that can be issued by portable music players, however, accompanied by increasing concern data on hearing damage caused by the excessive use of such sources.
However, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise, which can significantly reduce these hearing damage.
The EU's Scientific Committee's opinion states that those who use a portable recording device who listen to music with a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week are more than the maximum current value for working noise.
If someone listens to music for a longer time in similar circumstances, there will be a risk of permanent hearing damage after five years.
This means that about 5 to 10 percent of those using the portable device, which can also represent 2.5 to 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno set up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
Today starts, until March, results are expected in June.
This is the schedule for the operation of the Committee called the future of the capital of Rome, which was set up this morning at the new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
In the next six months, the President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Members of the Commission will draw up Rome's directives.
After the end of March, the public meeting and the municipal committee will evaluate the study and plans so that the strategic plan for the capital is officially approved by the Municipality and Prime Minister Gianni Alemanno in June.
"This is a completely independent committee, in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented, emphasises Alemanno's role, to develop proposals for the ideas of developing Rome, which may be supported by political decision-makers, so the Assembly and the Municipal Committee.
There is no conflict of competence, we just wanted a platform where big plans for Rome could be created.
In March, after his work, the Committee will be dissolved because it has a mandate for specific time.
In June, we are submitting a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of Rome Headquarters - the mayor said.
For those who consider the Commission to be unnecessary, indicating that the opinion he has set up does not have a compulsory force, Alemanno responds: "All depends on what work the Commission will do and on the quality of proposals to the table.
If the quality proves to be appropriate, as in the case of the Attali Committee in France, which I am confident in the case of Rome, it will play an important role in its contribution.
The power of policy is often fragmented in the management of daily affairs and in dealing with urgent cases from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further and plan for a longer time and work committed to the development and future of Rome."
The mayor of Rome wants to point out that "the Commission is not considered to be useless "waterheads", as it is free of charge, and is not going to go to any euros of Roman citizens, but it serves to encourage thoughts and aims to involve the most outstanding minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "the need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework, which enables our city to jump on the quality that he would so need, thinking about his future in a united spirit".
On the future of which the mayor of Rome stresses: "It will not only be limited to current local government frameworks but will look far further", we see not only the future metropolis and the capital status of the city, but also the role it can play as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A known, independent American politician wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first Jimmy Carter, who decided to ruin the American economy with his choices, and developed close relationships with the enemy Islam (so that he does it as a private man today)."
As the election time approaches, attacks against Obama are densified.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambitions.
Obama believes in an unfamiliar way that you can win the highest public dignity of a nation with two governors and five senators black so far!"
These attacks are actually nothing to say; of course they are racist, but they don't answer the question of the voters, whether it will be a good president, and then there are public opinion research: they indicate that Obama will win, and it will make a significant difference.
In this case, there is someone who listens to his emotions and not to his mind.
In the southern States, a mississippi newspaper wrote in his principal article: we know well that in the voterabin, the true American patriot who voted.
There is a side of American thinking that remains hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk what you want, we'll know where we're gonna put the lyx on Obama or McCain."
Some people swear to him, if Obama wins, they leave the United States.
They never said such words until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all the cleverness, the democrats' winning weapon is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush's office? 89 percent responded to Iraq.
America's changing.
This nation has lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and they've been swept down so that he flew home.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
Still, most people believe that Iraq was Bush's weakness.
It's a huge task for someone who's gonna take George W.
U.S.: the economic collapse is already felt by journalists, and the time in editorials has come, and many people blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW Research Institute asked 500 American journalists how they feel about their future position and spiritual power.
Well, right now, almost all journalists are pessimists about their own future.
However, it was not clearly claimed that their concerns would have been reduced in terms of credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as before.
The problem of American journalists is money.
They believe that the 2008 crisis is a failing economic model.
There is a further serious problem with the newsroom, i.e. restrictions on journalist editorials.
If we don't want traditional journalism, in the sense that the great public has achieved in this context, to shrink at least, this problem needs to be resolved, says the presses asked.
Today, there is a well-seen and complex pessimism characterized by American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior leaders working in the printed press are convinced that national zsurnalistism is on the wrong path.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in top leader position.
Printed vs. electronic press.
To see where the world net is going, the press's employees are not having a problem.
The biggest publishers make their way to the Internet, and many of them think they're the killer of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" identified by journalists has increased to 79 per cent.
The 500 asked journalists acknowledged that he'd put his voks alongside technology in the hope that it might be for the benefit of blackmail.
Today, in the U.S. press, there's a break between editorial leaders, i.e. the directors and the reporters working for them.
At national level, 56 percent of the leaders are sure that their correspondents share their information with others, while at local level this rate can only be made to 23 percent.
Some of us are involved in this with a certain job.
At national level, 47 percent of the leaders fear that they can lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, that's 30 percent.
The question of "sure work" in America at team level (for our editors, szerk.) is constantly on the agenda.
Only 13 percent of journalists have a contract.
In the case of a huge nation like the 300 million inhabitants of the United States, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet service providers work, employers usually offer as much as they want, so the thing "when or not" works on the basis.
Directors usually receive high salary, and editors can earn ten thousand dollars per month, in addition to their pension and health insurance fees.
However, freedom works quite a complicated principle: the first year is x day, third, until the maximum 15 days are reached after a certain time.
But the American journalists, according to their own statements, are often "infected" in the year.
Everything is a function of the climate.
UNIPOL: ROMANIC REPUBLIC: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFRATAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Council of the Rome Court, rejected the application of Danilo Coppola in the real estate sector, who wanted to visit Grottaferrat to a Roman apartment.
The investigation against Coppola is due to economic bankruptcy, in the context of an investigation in the case of the Unipol - BNL agreement on the exchange of shares.
Last week, during the procedure against him, the house arrest was dissolved and changed to the residence ban for Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have requested that the property specialist visit the capital apartment of the rural town.
According to the Court, however, these fluctuations (in respect of which the prosecutor has submitted a refusal) would allow the company to influence and access the evidence brought against it.
In danger of the elite
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago, when the House did not vote for the 700 billion dollar rescue package presented by the White House: a major part of the Americans was more interested and still interested in the punishment of Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is also supported by the New York Times yesterday, which informs us that the current crisis has led to a breakthrough within the Republic of Paris, which shows an increasing divide between the traditional, retarded, the federal and business circles' Eastern coastal attitude and the new anti-Dan Washington and financial trends in central and southern states.
This direction has been expressed in a critical manner during the introductory vote of the Parliament.
However, this event is only one of the major changes that the economic transformation that is still going to indicate or see, not only in the United States, but also in the whole Western world, and perhaps beyond it.
It seems that the crisis, as well as in the US and in Europe, only speeds up the long-standing phenomena that are solid in this new atmosphere and finally come to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-establishment, the re-establishment of the dual category of state sovereignty in public knowledge, a form of re-statement of the economy.
The crisis affects the banking-financial institutions, which are also in close contact with the foreign country, but mainly, and rather widely, they engage people and families that live in a single country in a state.
This, however, is a direct political challenge for those in government: what to respond to the difficulties and protests of the people who are otherwise elected.
Thus, in economic terms, the crisis seems global, but in political terms it is almost national.
It seems that political internacionalism is essentially outside the coast: it is a fair evidence of this that the European Union cannot set a common policy direction between different interests and different national strategies.
So everyone expects the intervention from each national government, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, but mostly the opening up of funds: as only individual states have economic resources in a difficult situation, a financial stock capable of cleaning things up.
They also have the assets and the powers to use them: under circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that are likely to have no other market and no international organisation in such a way.
Furthermore, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on the national state is fully in line with the fact that economic growth has taken place in recent times is an increasingly important factor which is closely linked to this element: this is territorial.
In a paradox way, while we were convinced that we had already entered the network, the increasingly sophisticated world of technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was ordered to dominate the world, we had to realize once and for all that our future is increasingly dependent on things that are less devout than water, crop and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, yet fully linked to a restricted place, to a area.
So whoever controls the area has a lot more batting cards than it was born in a place where there was no crop, no oil, and no water.
I would also move to the second novelty, a kind of a fracture line.
Who says that the area, the state, the government, will say, politically, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two interchangeable phenomenons:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, for people who can take care of the events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, in particular economic leaders, is the total loss of credit, who have proved to be completely inappropriate and proven that many of them are still in blurred areas.
The two together are even more important and in some sense more disturbing: the feeling of credit loss, impatientness, incompetence and segregation, which affects the entire leadership elite in a growing number of Western countries.
So it seems that the population is becoming increasingly convinced that the time of the social elite at the top of this year is over. It expired before their actions, experience, lifestyle, culture, in the context of the complex word, and societal elite becomes increasingly alien from the opinion of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in the form of a segregated, but strong delegation moves against the dominant divide and the traditional political system. This voters did not expect to be "in the stallions", or in recent times the sudden change in public voice. Such as the conservatives gained power in Austria and Bajoran, the collapse of the working party in Great Britain or the riot of the American Congress representatives against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right side).
It seems that the traditional elite, its parties, programmes, and even its own programs can be said that he is becoming less understandable with his habits, press and renowned senses in the same way, and that is why he can increasingly represent what has been going on in the deeper layers of Western society for a while. Furthermore, the economic crisis is increasing, spreading and potentially able to create an increasingly impedimental spirit.
Despite all of this, speaking of "the riot of masses", honestly, it would be an exaggeration.
But it's okay to open your eyes at all.
We can use super-powered glue on the wall.
With a super-powered glue to overcome gravity and walk on the wall as Spider-Man.
This goal was set by several American research centres, and a group of four institutions are close to the solution.
With a glue of only 2.5 square centimeters, researchers managed to glue and hold a 100-pound body on a vertical wall.
The U.S. magazine “National Science ” published discoveries from some researchers at Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The substance invented by the scientist group has already been produced from the development of special "coal nanoductory" materials.
"The adhesive operating principle must be imagined as a package of spaghetti-like pipe system", says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher of the Atlanta Georgia Institute of Technology.
Researchers have come up with the idea of the leg covered by the microscope, which gives the animal a perfect tap.
Tests carried out with different materials such as glass, teflon and choke paper have been confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the feet of these reptiles, while "wisely removed from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher of the engineer arm of the dayton University.
"This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
We can go on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe, but researchers think in a less impressive use than the interconnection of electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes do well to drive heat and electricity.
You can find more app in the field of space search.
Superheroes can wait.
RESEARCH - the Berkeley University of California also conducts experiments with a new adhesive material.
According to the article published in American Chemical Society c., scientists from California presented a hairdryer made of microfibrous material that during the movement on the surface is self-cleaning, always giving a perfect tap.
Drugs?
We need to take care of the grapefruit, orange and apple.
These are thirst drinks with high vitamins, especially in the summer, if they are taken together with certain life-saving medicinal products, changing their absorption, by confirmation or reduction of their effects, depending on the case.
The risk of co-administration of carton or fresh fruit juices and certain medicinal products by Professor David Bailey, London University of Western Ontario, announced at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit juice was already on the pillow of the defendants when it was found that some antibiotics, antihistamine, anxiety-reducing, heart rhythm control and nerve medicines could be considered to be toxic.
CHARACTERISTICS - Two years ago the Italian Medicines Institute itself published the news in its official publicity and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with such co-administration and to watch what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NO CSAK GRAPEFRUIT - Researchers say that orange and apples also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
The list of active substances that prevent the absorption of grapefruit and other fruit juices could be classified in length.
This is why Michele Carru, Professor of the State University of Milan Pharmaceuticals: "Specially, such discoveries are referred to the various national and international pharmaceutical agencies, who, if necessary, will ensure that the information contained in the relevant substance is changed.
Therefore, you should always read the package leaflet for the intended use of the medicine, and if something is not understandable, we should not let ourselves be affected, but ask our doctor or pharmacist clearly," stressed Ansa’s specialist.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Economic Award
The American Paul Krugman received the Nobel Economic Award for the analysis of the territorial links between commercial models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old neokeynesian Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the strongest critics of the economic and foreign policy measures of the Bush Government.
After a few months of the terrorist attack in September 2001, Krugman, in his New York Times, predicted that the latter event would have even more fatal consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of twin towers.
This forecast has not limited the debate, it has been put into the eyes of the economist in many times, but today we know it was accurate.
"I'm astonished, and I'm a little shocked that the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom has gone beyond public interest", said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "greatly valuable economist", but it is fairly "promoting the criticisms of the over-liberalism of the Bush Government in an aggressive way".
Open Office, the third edition was worth the antimicrosoft package
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is present today, an open-programme application package, which aims at increasing layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from public administration.
After almost a year of work by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office presents a number of new enthusiasms to the general public: the welcome screen and the rethinked, less spartan user interface, it offers several important innovations, such as the compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and supports the new format of ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 according to ISO standard.
A special attention was paid to the compatibility of Office 2007, so that Open Office can open new extended Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
It's interesting that some of the modules are specific features such as which allow you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files by email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into the graphic module while maintaining the site arrangement.
On this surface, we can also create "hibrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with table managers or text editors.
The sharing within applications has also been through a number of developments: the table manager supports the common use of workbooks, but prevents the re-checking of each other's work.
Some companies are already working to make some of the functions available on the Internet (on the cloud, on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be presented in the weeks to come.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html.
The program package is also available outside the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems for Linux.
At your request, we can take the installation CD at our home or at our work.
In view of the spread of the home application, freedom is probably the greatest attraction, but the Open Office programme package is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector, as it can count for many administrative and school projects.
There is no ideal education, advice and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open new business perspectives.
The Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-compliant text editor; Calc, Excel-replaceable table manager; Impress, Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase is the best known Access database manager; and ultimately Draw the graphic module.
The 2008 target is to achieve 5 million downloads. But if we consider that the new version has already been published, this figure will probably be higher than the expected.
Kohl's results are positive, it's the fourth dopping case.
At the last stage of Tour de France, one of the participants, who competed in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, has produced a positive sample, Bernhard Kohl, Austrian, who also won the best mountain leader with my bronze.
The news was on the website of the Equipe Internet newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor, the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol, and after the German Gerolsteiner competition, Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in the third generation version of the EPO Cera test.
The sample of Kohl's blood, similar to those performed in recent weeks, has been studied by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malamabry.
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera results, Austria will lose its third placement and will prohibit competition for two years according to the requirements.
The report on the positive outcome of Kohl's third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and reported with the Associated Press news agency: he indicated the positive dopping outcome to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians managed to stand behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, and won the best-minded trick.
BEVANDORS: NEW YORK's tempered the request, ITALY's RASSI?
Italy has only recently become one of the popular destinations of the host immigrants from the country of immigrants.
This is why "Belpaese" becomes a racist nation? This is the question raised by the New York Times, the young Burkina Faso Abdul William Guibre - who was murdered last month in Milan because he stole a box of biscuits - he devotes a long article to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well characterised by what New York Times is called the "paradox of the nursings": in the northern regions the "strongest integration and the highest employment" is also the "the support of immigration and Northern League" in the country.
To support increased tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also quotes cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws required by League, which would bring the grass on immigration more closely and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants, were presented as an example of the change in mood in Italy.
This trend was also highlighted by the President of the Republic and Pope: "Giorgio Napolitano met the Beneds in the Quirinale Palace, and called on the state and the Church to work together to overcome racism."
Students are suffering from expensive rental fees, even a room cost 900 euros
The market for accommodations issued to universities is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, Rental Rentals, a student can pay up to EUR 900 for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already spent so magnificent sizes that, due to the gross cost of the families, is blocking students from the possibility of learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of Sunia's study office. "The high demand in these cities has distorted the market so much that there is a general process of excitement against locals."
In most cases, the real estate offers also include a series of irregularities: non-registered contracts, non-repayment contracts, associated subsidy.
According to Sunia, it would be necessary to take an exceptional measure that will allow the price to be maximised through the revision of the tax system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, around Brianza, the price of a single room is also EUR 450 for a bed; the average cost of a single room is EUR 650 (Bande Nere's neighbourhood) up to EUR 800 ( Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but can reach EUR 900 (Vittoria's neighbourhood).
In Florence, an average bed is EUR 350/400, a room costs about 700.
In Bologna, where the majority of students live in the neighbourhood of the university, a bed place costs EUR 250/280 when it is double and EUR 370-500 when it comes to a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), one person and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Somewhat cheaper (550 euros a single room) prices around other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
All can be saved in the outskirts: 300 euros cost a bed and 450 single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, they ask for 300/450 euros for a bed, for a room between 400 and 600 euros. The highest in the area of the price bed is Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Amine.
In Bari, there will be 250/350 euros for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities prices are even lower in absolute value, but they represent greater weight within the city bud.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students are often looking for accommodation, there is another abnormality: the rent charge from foreign students is approximately 25-30% higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, good-old Cinema Paradiso, in the cities, the time of the old cinema rooms was sacrificed
Traditional movies are closed for the Multiplexes.
"A city where there are no movies, blind city, is like a face without eyes."
The images made by the director Giuseppe Tornatore are presented efficiently in all that takes place in the Italian capitals, but also in rural areas.
Circumstance of the cinemas - the appearance of the large multitermic cinema in the suburbs and, consequently, the storm of one-termists in the city centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time, it has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When historical and memory-full places disappear, "it's like a friend leaving, an acquaintance with whom we shared our paths and many experiences," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The movie that was 20 years ago an Oscar prize and the Cannes Festival award, tells the story of a small-town movie lirian story, the saltwave, after a movie story that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data provided by Anec, is clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional film theatres have been closed. The biggest loss was booked in the major cities: 10 film theatres have been closed in Florence, 9 Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 torino and 5 Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna, which has lost 82 single-term cinema and then Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that for their disappearance, it is not the responsibility of the multiplexes that proves better than the highest number of newly opened multi-term cinemas in Italy in these three regions: the number of rooms in Lombardia, 81 in Toscana and Emilia-Romagna in the last five years increased by 195.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally", says President Anec, Paolo Protti. "We are building new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of the existing ones, because when a city cinema closes, not all of them are willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention unloaded financial funds for the support of operators: the State's late debt can amount to about EUR 10 million.
It is also an ethical and moral disgrace that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
It would require €16-18 million a year to maintain the market".
This is the first Italian city that decided to remedy the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec.
The provisions would include the tax advantages granted to operators and the advantages granted to the public in order to facilitate accessibility: viewers may enter restricted zones and parking tariffs in certain parking lots.
"I like this initiative" - says Giuseppe Tornatore - and I hope that other cities, even with other measures, will follow Bologna's example.
However, it is also certain that traditional movies, to be able to fight with the rule of multiplexes, need to improve sound and image quality, because today's audience is much more demanding.
To protect the traditional cinema, it was always an important question for me: closing Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave the cinema, which led me to doing the Cinema Paradiso, although I've been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the via Nazionale before the closed Rialto or Quirinale, so I don't see the posters blacked from the dust, I'd rather turn my head.
Close ties between politics and 'ndrangheta, arrested Mayor Gioia Tauro
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromodel Clan in municipal decisions."
The judges of the Anti-Maffia Directorate of Calabria and the mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor of Rosarno, who were arrested in charge of external participation in criminal cooperatives this morning.
Bilincs have been taken into the hands of Gioacchino Piro model, the senior intermediary between the clan and the administration, and a lawyer nephew, the same as the boss, who had been convicted earlier for participation in a mafia-like crime cooperative, and a compensation of EUR 10 million.
"One of the law and moral rules, more of the good taste," says the prosecutors, and the two local authorities have expressed their intention of paying advisory fee to the lawyer of Piromode.
"In this way, the clan would have had a formal visit to the city hall, which would have given us a further opportunity to control and control the administration, which could be of significant importance anyway.
Agazio Loiero, Chairman of the General Assembly of the Calabrian region, does not hide that there is a number of conflicts in the region between local institutions and the organised subworld: there are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than anywhere else, where it will not be possible to play together.
However, many local politicians are resisting the 'ndrangheta' pressure, they are the heroes that remain clean."
Continuing this morning's arrests in July, when the police announced that the Piromodel clan was managed to be cut off.
At the end of April, local politicians were released from their mandate to manage the municipal government. Gioia Tauro's Municipality Committee was once dissolved in 1991, even because of the alleged mergers between organised crime and local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democrat mayor of the eradication, came to the head of the right-to-mouth coalition in the second round of 2006.
He cried for Botran when the County House ordered the dissolving of the Municipal Committee.
He brought to the Court Vice-President Marco Minnin and accused him of planning everything with a political aim, but the Court stated in the arrest warrant signed this morning that the Piromodel clan was dared to require the A3 project to be changed.
The ordered hearing against Dal Torrione reveals - the public attorneys writes - that "it was inclined to meet the demands of a large group of entrepreneurs who were well-known to the Piromodel family, to subordinate the decisions of the municipal government to the clan interests."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come
An inexhaustible source of energy, which accounts for 70 percent of the surface of the planet, and which is just discovered by large international energy companies
Hulls, sea streams, wires, and a renewable energy source for which giants like Chevron are now trying to put their hands on.
They've been searching for a hundred years to find a way to get energy from the sea movements.
By 1980, when the price of oil decreased, the idea of marine energy has been misused, but today the need for environmental protection and the rise in the price of petroleum will give the sector a new boost.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) 2007 estimates that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by facilities that use sea waves.
This quantity is twice as much as the nuclear power stations are currently producing.
In addition, there would still be the flows and wires.
The giants in the ground.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant to be established in Northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary step when the signature was declared.
Two years have passed, and more and more companies have taken voks alongside maritime energy, including those who have so far been dedicated to traditional energy.
"The Chevron is studying the energy-efficient technologies of the oceans and considering the possibility of cooperation with us," announced one of the American oil giant's co-operatives, the Wall Street Journal's economic newspaper.
This cooperation concerns obtaining the authorisation required for the launch of the submarine energy project issued by the American Energy Commission.
This is not a minor matter, especially when we consider that the US is working on oil extraction in Alaska and that President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drillings.
In addition to Chevron, the New York Verdant Power Inc. and the New Jersey Ocean Power are the way of energy that can be obtained from the sea.
Technology is waiting for development.
According to experts, this is still an in-depth technology, because the energy from the sea does not dissolve doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities, such as Portugal or Scotland, are all small sizes, and therefore there is no too much problem with the ecosystem.
However, in order to generate energy in a greater degree, facilities that are more environmentally significant are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses an interconnected booying system.
The pushes raised by the waves and moving the buoys up and down shall be transformed into a hydraulic pressure of the plungers and cylinders placed in them.
Pressure turns a turbinate, which feeds a generator.
The electric power gets to the mainland on the cables pulling under the sea.
At the same time, there are four similar installations in planning phases that are only waiting for the federal permission. A part of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, however, has already begun energy production for a shopping centre and a parking lot using six submaritime turbines in the East River of New York.
When the water moves, the turbines rotate the shovels and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant has announced that he has a long list of partners who are only waiting for permission to use energy.
It's floating after the lights.
Currently particular attention is needed to make use of the options that can be exploited through the flood.
Although there is a periodic phenomenon, the electric power is more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves, so it can be seen as a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska and the rest of the coastal States spent 7.5 million dollars in 2008 to exploit the energy supplied by the tide, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
