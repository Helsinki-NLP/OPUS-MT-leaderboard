Welsh's representatives are afraid they look stupid.
Some Members of the delegation have been confused with the proposal to change their title to the MWP, namely the Member of the Welsh Parliament.
Kohu was born with a plan to turn the name of the representative body into the House of Wales.
Regardless of the party's position, the members of the representation will be concerned that the change may cause them to be ridiculed.
According to a representative of the Workers' Party, the group is concerned that the name's "critical with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group "not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to the representative of the Conservative Party, his group is taking the view of a "open mind", but he points out that the word of the MWP is a short-speaking leap of a stupid word.
In Wales, the w letter is used in this context in the same way as the U-word of Yorkshire.
The Commission, which is currently preparing the legislative amendment necessary for the change in names, said: "The final decision on the headings of the delegation is, of course, owned by the Members."
The Wales Government Act for 2017 empowers the delegation to change its name.
In June, the Commission published a question of opinion on the proposal that the appointment of a representative body for the Wales Parliament would benefit from broad support.
The Commission favours members of the delegation to be appointed as members of the Wales Parliament or abbreviated by the WMP, but the MWP option was most supported in the public opinion survey.
The members of the representation are obviously proposing alternative headings, but the lack of consensus may lead to the main problem for President Elin Jones, from whom the legislative proposal is expected to change within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also contains other changes to the activities of the delegations, such as the rules on the loss of representative action and the form of the committee system.
During the legislative process, the members of the delegation may make their final vote on the title to which they should be invited.
The Macedonians will go to the electorate in the referendum on the change of the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether the name of the country will be converted into the North-Makedonian Republic.
The referendum aims at solving the decades of a neighbouring country with Greece, which also has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens has long repeated that the name of the North Neighbourhood is in practice a regional requirement for its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, has said that he would ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that the change in name is simply the price of EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins' watches slow down when the Harlem Churchs live in difficult times
"The old people I've been discussing with say that before every corner of the street there was a bar or a church," says Adams.
"Now there's neither of them."
He said that losing the bars is understandable.
He said, "Behavior has changed."
"Bars are no longer common living rooms in the neighbourhood, where people regularly meet."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of the property does not carry as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the exit box."
He added that the churches can be replaced by housing and apartments that are not people who support the rest of the neighbourhood.
"The most people who buy apartments from these buildings are going to be white," he says, "and so they will have to close their doors forever, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these rooms will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by the white congregations before Harlem became the dwelling area of black people - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original methodistic congregation of white men moved away in the 1930s.
The nearby church of blackskins acquired the building.
St. Martins took over a church of blackskins under the leadership of pastor John Howard Johnson, leading a boikot against the main merchants of Harlem's 125th Street, who were opposed to hiring or promoting these blackskins.
The fire in 1939 damaged the building badly, and when Father Johnson’s congregation members were planning rebuilding, they introduced a tower clock game.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martins, proudly called the tower watches of the poor.
In July, the expert who called the tower watch game called it "cultural island" and "unrecognised historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, a Michigan University expert, also pointed out that it was the world's first black music tower play. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a bigger tower watch game at Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says St. Martins didn't replace him.
In St. Martins, there has been a complex sky in recent months, with the help of architects and contractors hired by the religious leaders of the church and the episcopal sneakers on the other hand.
In July, Sakasti, the Governing Body of the Congregation’s Landlords of the Congregation, wrote to the sneakers, expressing their concern that the sneakers would “will take the costs” to the sacat, even though the sacat had not participated in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the sneakers of the sneakers.
Some congregationers complained about lack of transparency regarding sneakness.
Hai damaged a 13-year-old humiliator in California
The authorities tell me the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and damaged him when the boy dived the hummers on the opening day of the humidity season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before seven o'clock in the morning.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB that he dived with his friends on Saturday morning about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help.
Hammel told me that he thought he was only excited after he caught a hummer, but then he realized he was yelling, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
After getting to the boy, Hammel says he noticed that this whole solitary bone had been torn open.
"I'm telling everyone to get out of the water, there's shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flyed to the Rady Child Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The kind of shark that attacked you is unknown.
In the media event, Captain Larry Giles of life rescue said that there had been a few weeks earlier in the area, but it was found to be an unsafe species.
Giles added the victim's severe injuries to his upper arm.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casabladin Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there were more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Gotsbury's intending to be in the United Kingdom's Beauty Department
I've gotsbury's challenged Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' goods altogether beauty care departments that serve experts.
This is a significant movement for the United Kingdom's 2,8 billion GBP beauty care industry, which continues to grow, even though the sale of fashion and home reserves is deteriorating. Larger beauty care departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country and will be extended to other shops next year.
Beauty care products are placed because supermarkets are trying to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and households.
Gotsbury's tells its beauty care product range doubles to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space, and they get their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
The Supermarket will also regain its Boutique makeup range. In the course of the process, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly because young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop odour chain experiments with rental shops in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second was opened later in Burmingham in Selly Oak.
Internet purchases and the transfer of food purchases to small purchases in close shops forces supermarkets to invent new attractions for customers.
I gotsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that the shops will look more like the stores when the supermarket chain struggles against cheap shops like Ald and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores and also Habitat stores.
The Supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew its beauty care and pharmaceutical departments.
At the beginning of the 2000s, Sainsbury's tried the joint venture with Boots, but the cooperation ended with the dispute on how to share the income of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows a business store where Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, owned three years ago, with a pound of 125 million.
The company reported Lloyds to be part of the plan, which extends the selection of luxurious skin care products to four stores with signs such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury's commercial leader, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty care departments to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in workers who have received special training who are ready to advise customers.
Our selection of brands meets all the needs and our attractive environment and our convenient location makes us a convincing shopping destination for beauty care, which challenges the traditional way to buy."
Peter Jones's "rage" after Holly Willoughby retired from the treaty of £11 million.
The Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "in his wrath" when the TV director Holly Willoughby retired from the agreement with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and clothing marks to Truly.
The twin company has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old director of this Morning programme announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pissed off the Dragons Den Star Peter Jones by withdrawing their profitable lifestyle business in the last few minutes, and now he intends to focus on his new giants with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources tell Jones was "rage" in the last Tuesday's tense-sensitive meeting that was held at the head office of Jones's business in Marlow, Buckinhamshire.
The company has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand, and it was assumed to double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
37-year-old Willoughby reported in Instagram to leave Truly, Jones flew one of his vacation homes from Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was clearly Holly's main project.
It was his long-distance plan to ensure his survival for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left all the astonishment in power.
No one had faith in Tuesday's events so close to the publication.
Marlow's head office has a stock full of products that are expected to sell."
According to experts, this Morning driver is one of the most surely productive stars in Britain, and his departure can cause millions of losses to the company due to the investment in the product that includes all pillows and clothing for home food, not to mention delays in the publication.
It can mean the end of long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close for ten years with Jones and this wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby arranged for Cappin Trulyy in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones became president in March.
Couples holiday together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be baked from the new brand delegate of M & S, and he will replace Ant McPartlin as the director of the I'm A Celebrity programme.
The source near Jones said last night, "We didn't comment on his business."
A lot of talk and then we fell in love
He was joking about the criticism that the media would receive on their comments that some would consider to be inappropriate to the President, as well as the positiveness of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be a "new anchor."
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had inspired the first meeting of July in a significant step towards North Korea's nuclear warfare.
However, the nuclear negotiations have been contaminated.
After more than three months of the Singapore Summit in July, the North Korea Summit Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North Americans do not see a "responsive reaction" to the early military activities in North Korea.
He said, instead, that the United States would continue its sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"North Korean is doing great," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship."
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results.
He also defended his unusual style when he talked about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get out 10 000 more, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing out the audience directly ahead.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
As an example of Lombok’s exhibits, a number of foreign volunteer organisations were told that they were not required.
The national emergency required for international assistance was not declared, although about 10% of Lombok’s inhabitants had been homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children constitutes a returning group, it is not sure whether foreign staff can work on the field.
Sutopo, informant of the national disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities will assess the situation to see whether international organisations are allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Indonesia remains unfortunately unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account repeated earthquakes.
Although tsunami shields have been built in Acehi, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The salary probably lost lives because of the lack of tsunami warning circus, even though the warning was valid.
Travelling between the numerous islands in Indonesia is challenging even in the best circumstances.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the earthquake in Lombok is on its way to return, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new accident area.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's past infrastructure at the centre of its election campaign and has provided money to improve roads and railways.
However, there has been a lack of funding for the administration of one, while the new elections are approaching next year.
The tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims of the country has taken the oldest form of religion, also increase their pressure.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street fights with jungle knifes, rifle guns and arrows, as well as other original weapons. This has led to over 1,000 people's death and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their home.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool drowned a late equilibrium against Chelsea
On Saturday, Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from loss in the valioliga after painting 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an input from Xherdan Shaqir 27 away from Chelsea's goal when his team was at the goal of defeat.
He moved the ball to the left before he frightened the shot towards the back stop.
The shot floated above the punishment area toward the right corner.
Finally, the ball fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to play myself to get the ball and players like Shaq will always play as much upwards as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, took one touch and triggered without thinking too much."
Chelsea led a fight during the mid-term of 1-0 Eden Hazard, Belgium, painted in 25 minutes.
In the situation, the Blues storm gave Mateo Kovacic a heel feed before he fled near the central field and spurt the Liverpool field.
Kovacic played a fast wall feed in the middle field.
Then he freed Hazard's punishment zone with a wonderful passport.
Hazard escaped from defense and passed Liverpool Alisson Becker's left leg with a shot in the back corner.
Liverpool meets at the stage of the masters' league on Wednesday at 15 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meets at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia rises to 832 deaths
In early Sunday, the Indonesian disaster agency reported an increase in the number of earthquake and tsunami death victims to 832 victims.
At the press conference, the informant of the Agency Sutopo Purwo reported that many had trapped the ruins of collapsed buildings when 7.5 magnified earthquake hit on Friday and lifted up up to six-foot waves.
The stainless buildings spread widely to 380 000 inhabitants, please.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man as a suspect in murder after finding a woman stabbed to death.
A woman's body found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning started a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 at Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect.
The police are asking the people in the area to report if they've seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its element, but I appeal to all those who have been near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also call on all, in particular, taxi drivers who may have recorded something on the instrument board video, to contact the police and may have vital information for the investigation.
The police informant has confirmed that the woman who was found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
Today afternoon, the crime scene has come to any woman who may know who has asked about her where she was found.
As the investigation continues, the police report that they are trying to inform the victim's closest to what happened.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told me that no one was allowed from the building or out.

The Cromwell statue of Parliament was part of the rewriting charter of history
Extinguishing a statue would be a poetic right, given that his own fanatic puritan carriers destroyed the cultural and religious monuments of England as well as the best talibanis.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "typeryde" and "rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, the President of Cromell, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would make a target of Oliver Cromwell's statue in front of the palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not command or execute the Iconoclasm of the British Civil Wars.
Wrong Cromwell might have to suffer from the actions of his ancestors Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's wonderful description of Cromwell reveals the opinions of the 18th century, and it is historic evidence of the character that many still regard as worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Monet, although more perhaps in the 1800s than today, thinks Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against the external pressure that, of course, was caused by monarchy in this case.
The question of whether a precise description of the subject is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
At least it is certain that the middle of the 16th century dispute has shaped the future development of our nation, and Cromwell, on the other hand, must be identified as a character representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievement as a state manager deserves thanks and memory."
Killer pig smashed a Chinese farmer's life
Local media tells the pig attacked the farmer and killed it on the market in south-eastern China.
Only the body of a man identified by the name "Yuan" was found near the piglet near Liupanshui on the market in Guizhou Province. The man's artery was broken and he was on top of the blood, the South China Morning Post news on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, the pig shepherd is prepared to vaccinate pigs in the Xining Province of Qinghai in China.
His traveling cousin and his cousin were news about the nearby Yunna province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
His cousin found him the next morning, and he also noticed that the door of a close pig was open.
In Sikala, he said he saw a big scream with his mouth in the blood.
According to the news, a criminal investigation confirmed a 250-pound squirrel from the dead farmer.
Guiyang Evening News says a cousin named Wu said, "My cousin's feet were bloody and ruined."
The surveillance camera looks like the cousin arrives at the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man wasn't part of Yuan or his cousin.
One of the leaders of the market told the Evening News that the pig was locked behind locks so that it would not harm the other police when they gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reported to negotiate compensation for the death.
The pigs have been known to attack people before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kg shoved the Walesian farmer against this tractor until his wife managed to escape the animal.
The Oregon farmer had to eat his pigs in 2012. After the event, the farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News channel that, although the pigs are generally not aggressive, the taste of blood can be used as a "discharge".
"They're just gambling.
They're like little children, very curious, and their purpose is not to hurt.
All you have to do is respect them properly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring extensive hardships to the South Americans
Hurricane Rosa will deteriorate predictedly when moving to the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the near future, however, Rosa will bring floods to the southwest of Mexico and the United States.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 metres per second, namely the first class of hurricane, Sunday at 5 a.m. of the east coast, and was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time there is a low pressure on the Pacific, which heads east towards the West Coast of the United States, and when Rosa arrives to the California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it begins to squeeze the deep tropical humidity northward to the southern United States.
On Monday, Rosa brings up to 250 millimetres of rain into some parts of Mexico.
The tropical humidity that then interacts with the approaching low pressure forms large rain areas in the southwest in the next few days.
In local terms, between 25 and 100 millimetres of rain cause dangerous heavy densities and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes rain in certain landing areas between 50 and 75 mm per hour, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas in southwest, and in particular Arizona, are expected to be between 50 and 100 millimetres of rain.
Hard rainlights are possible and conditions can quickly weaken because of the fragmentation of tropical rain.
The threat of tropical rain is strongly recommended to avoid walking into the wilderness.
Rare rains can turn the canyons into sparkling rivers, and thunderstorms produce local wind dusts and flying dusts.
The approaching low pressure area brings local hard drives to the southern California coastal areas.
More than 10 millimetres of rain are possible, causing small waste flows and sliding roads.
It would be the first rain in the region.
The scattered tropical rains begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday until the rains expand on Monday and Tuesday.
The rainfalls spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, in the United States, there can be strong flushings throughout the temperatures of the Arctic area in the cooling, but while the tropicals remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes high temperature fluctuations in short distances.
In the middle of the United States, there is an excellent example of large temperature differences on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omahan and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowan Des Moines is almost 20 degrees.
During the summer, the warmth will continue to increase and expand in the next few days.
From the beginning of October, warmth is expected widely in the central and eastern parts of the United States, while the temperature is +26 degrees in which it feels like north-east levels.
In New York, the temperature can be painted on Tuesday +26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecasts in the east of the United States there are good opportunities for higher average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million looked at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million broadcasts from six television channels were held on Tuesday, where Brett Kavanaugh, Judge of the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who blamed him for sexual crime in the 1980s, gave their fascinating witness statement.
At the same time, the political patch situation continued when the television companies suspended their broadcasting with the last moment reverse that the FBI was conducting a weekly investigation of charges by Senator Jeff Flake, Arizona, on the basis of the agreement.
Ford told the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100% certain that the defeated Kavanaugh shook him and tried to take his clothes off in high schools.
On the other hand, Kavanaugh gave a sentimental witness statement in which he said he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company decreased the average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels of viewers.
The figures of other channels that sent the opportunity, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers in offices.
Some of the proportions indicate that the reading corresponds to the number of American football drop-offs or the number of viewers in the Oscar Gate.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers in all television companies was on Fox News Channel, whose opinion directors strongly supported Kavanaugh's name. On average, the channel had 5.69 million viewers throughout the day.
ABC was second on his 3,26 million viewer.
Nielsen told me that CBS had 3,1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2,52 million viewers.
After hearing, interest was still high.
There was Flake in the middle of the drama Friday.
The cameras of CNN and CBS described how the screams of demonstrators confronted him on the way to the elevator to the hearing of the Legal Affairs Committee on Friday. The moderate republican backing forces had previously announced that he was voting for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed up straight, how he stood in a minute's look down on the swings flying.
"Seison right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you believe he'll tell the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told."
Flake said that his office gave an opinion and added, before the lifts were closed, that he would have more information after the committee was consulted.
Hours later, the cable and broadcasting networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began to vote on the removal of Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary.
However, Flake said it only works in the sense that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate in the next week, as the minority democrats have requested.
Flake was convinced in part by his friend, democrat Chris Coons, on the basis of his discussions.
Flake made his decision after discussing Coons and several other senators.
The choice of Flake had power because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has initiated FBI investigations on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit's political effort
In the interview of the Sunday Times magazine, Prime Minister Theresa May blames the people who criticise his EU differentiation plans for politics, which threatens the future and national interests of Britain.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
Another interview was published next to May's interview on the front page of the newspaper, where his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued to attack May's so-called Chequers' plan, and Johnson called for a proposal that Britain and the EU should charge each other's import duties, "to be completely insane".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a person as a suspect in LSU for the shooting of a 20-year-old Wayde Sims who died in a basketball game.
A 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, and Baton Rouge's police department says he's being charged with a second-grade murder.
The authorities published a video of Sims and Simpson's intervening, where the police tells them that Sims lost his glasses.
The police found the glasses at the scene and told me that they found Simpson's DNA, says WAFB.
The police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde in interrogation.
According to the Advocate magazine, his guarantee amount was set at $35,000.
The death detective of the municipality of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a shooting wound in the neck.
The Agency thanks the Louisiana Police Force, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the region for assisting the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's head of exercise, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "outsight and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-metre assailant grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father played basketball LSU'ss.
He recorded on average 5.6 points and 2.6 record balls in the last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that he was "aboved" and "aboved" from Wayde's death.
"You always fear something like this happens," Wayde said.
The volcano spits the ashes over Mexico City
Ash decommissioning from the Popocatepetl mountain has reached the southern residential areas of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Prevention Centre urged citizens to stay away from the volcano when the crater’s activity was accelerated and 183 gas and ash was registered during the day.
The center registers grains and vibrates several times.
In the social media, pictures were published where the windscreens of cars in residential areas such as Mexico City Xochimilco covered in thin ash layer.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano in the southwest of the main town since Mexico was shaken by 7.1 magnetized earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan Separatists gather together before the anniversary of the vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona in the convening of independent demonstrators and riot police. Thousands participated in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the divorce vote.
The police arrested the group of masqueraded self-employment supporters who threw the police with eggs and powder paintings that formed dark dust clouds on the streets normally filled by tourists.
During the day, more creeps broke out when the police used their bats to control the nuts.
The coincidences between the supporters of independence and the groups of Unionists continued for several hours, when the former were yelling "no forgetment, no forgiveness", and the latter "Let Spain live".
The local press reports that fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries in demonstrations.
The tension is still on the surface of an independent region one year after the 1st October referendum, which Madrid declares to be illegal, but which will be celebrated by the catalytic separatists.
The voters voted with a clear majority of independence, although the participation was the vote in the low-discriminatory boikoto.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in the violent gatherings last year, when the police tried to prevent voting at votes across the region.
Independence groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent national police support from demonstration.
However, an appeal was held, but it had to go another route.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old electrician, who participated in the demonstration of separatists with his wife, said that there is no longer hope for the independence of Catalan.
Last year, we experienced one of the best moments of our life.
I saw my parents cry when they could vote, but now we're stuck in place," he says.
Despite the current but vital victory in the last December regional elections, the speed of the parties to support the independence of Catalonia has shrinked this year. Many of the most known leaders are in a voluntary exile or arrested to wait for a trial of their involvement in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who described the police supportive demonstration on his phone, says on both sides of the politicians, there's a lieson controversy.
"Your business gets tense all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalonia leaders in the investigation until nine years, announced to participate in next year's European elections.
"The best way to condemn the aggravating of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish Government", he says.
Londonderry: Men were arrested after a car crashed into the house
From the age of 33, 34, and 39, men were arrested after the car was reported to run into a house in Londonderry.
The events progressed at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 7:30 a.m. in Britain.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
Somewhere near the car could have been shot by a spear line.
Livingston won Rangers 1-0 with Menga paint
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston secured victory
The serial shooter Livingston astonished the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second defeat in the 18th fight as the manager of the Ibrox Seuran.
The goal of Dolly Menga was finally enough to win Gary Holt's team when he came to another place shared with Hibernia.
Gerrardi's crew was missing the first guest victory of the season at Premiership, and next Sunday it meets the Serial Director Hearts, which is eight points ahead.
Rangers still meets in the European Union in Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his lossless pipe in the series for six matches, and Coach Holt hasn't lost once since Kenny Miler was replaced last month.
Livingston lost places to a visitor who was suffering from blade deficiency.
Holt's team should have led long before its goal, after causing Rangers the evil trouble with their steadfastness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finishing went wide, and then Alan Lithgow got to slide on a painting staircase to Craig Halkett's pussy, but he passed the ball.
The hosts favored the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate from special situations.
That's the way the important goal came.
Rangers caused Livingston a free shot, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played Menga a place he could move the ball to the center of the punishment area and finish.
By then, Rangers had been holding the ball, but he found that the home team was defending, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly wasn't exactly able to try it.
The same pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor prevented Scott Pittman and Lithgow overrun the ball from another special situation in Livingston.
The concentrations of Livingston's punishment were continuously cleaned off, and two situations were also called for an unduly punishable kick-off - the smuggled switcher Glenn Middleton and the ball hit the hand.
"Great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotlann at Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to cross the expectations and was excellent for all players, continuing through the rose lines.
The team's game mode and crew have not changed much to get back to the highest serial level.Holt must be acknowledged of the way in which he has strengthened the team after he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was incredibly responsible for organized defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toes of the whole fight.
But Rangers didn't have any ideas.
The team has occasionally played very well under Gerrardi's authority, but it has now remained far from his demand level.
The last feed was exhausted, and they managed to open the defense of the home team only once, and this should be a wake-up for the Rangers, which is the middle cats of the series table.
Erdogan received a different reception in Köln
The smile was sensitive and the sky on the blue Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the contested German visit by President Erdogan, the aim of the journey is to improve the relations of NATO allies.
There have been differences between human rights and freedom of the press and Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his way to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
In the city, the largest Turkish population resides outside Turkey.
The police prevented 25 000 support forces from gathering in front of the mosque, based on it on security grounds, but there were still many supporters gathering close to it to look at the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of which were Kurds - also brought to the votes, condemning both the policy of Erdogan and the decision of the German Government to invite him to the country.
Competitive protests reflect the distribution of opinions, and some of the Turkish Germans greet him as a hero when others wander him up to the self-government.
Inconsistency in Deptford: A bicycler dies in a crash with a car
A bikeman died when he hit a car in London.
The accident took place at about 10:00 a.m. local time near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there's a lot of traffic.
The driver stopped, and the care staff came to help the victim, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another bicycler died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from the Saturday accident.
The city police say they're trying to identify a man and inform his friends.
There are road blocks at the site and bus traffic has been re-routed, and cars have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in trouble.
Prisoner officials report the high security rating of six injured men in prison's troubles.
The ingestions began at the HMP Long Lart prison in Worcestershire about 09:30 on Sunday, the UK time and continues.
Tornado specialist cops have been brought to place to calm down the restlessness behind eight prisoners in one prison wing.
The small face injury of the police was dealt with at the scene.
One of the most inmates said: "The HMP Long Lartin prison has been sent to a specially trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and it is clear that responsible people are being taken over by the police, and they may need to spend longer behind the bars."
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lart, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison manager was told that he received hospital treatment after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In addition, in October, riot police were alerted to prison because of the serious troubles in which staff were attacked with biljardi balloons.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drying areas can benefit)
Arizona rarely encounters tropical low pressures, but that is exactly what happens at the beginning of the next week, when Hurricane Rosa’s remains move across the southwest desert, bringing the risk of heavy density.
During Monday and Tuesday, the national weather service has already alerted the cities of the southern and eastern Nevada, southern Caifornia and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to proceed directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and it arrives on Monday in the form of rain.
Phoenix’s national weather service pointed out in its tweet, that only "the ten tropical storms have preserved the tropical storm or low pressure space at 300 kilometres from Phoenix after 1950!
Katrina (1967) was still a hurricane within a distance of 65 kilometers from the border of Arizona.
The latest models of the national hurricane centre predict rains of 50-100 mm. With Mogoll's harness in Arizona, there can be up to 150 millimetres.
In other Southwest regions, including central rocky hills and Great Basin, there are actually 25-50 millilitres, and there can be up to 100 millimetres in total.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing in the area of droughts, if there is no danger of hard drives.
Although the floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains can be useful because of the severe drought in southern southern southern southern.
According to the U.S. drought agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest class, says weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first land in the California Peninsula in Mexico.
Sunday morning, Rosa's location is 620 kilometers south of Mexico's Punta Eugenia, which is still the hurricane's strong wind speed at 135 kilometres an hour, moving north at 20 kilometres an hour.
The storm loses its power when faced with cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm strong during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rains can be severe and cause a significant risk of flood.
"The north-western-Sonor of California is expected to be 75-150 millimetres, and up to 250 millimetres is possible", says Weather.com.
Then Rosa continues to travel through Mexico as a tropical storm before it arrives at the border of Arizona as a tropical low pressure in Tuesday morning hours; from there it continues to travel through Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday.
"The largest risks of Rosa or its residues are related to very severe rains in the California Peninsula, northwest Solo and the Southwest U.S.A.," says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy decomforts and waste flows in deserts, as well as land vultures in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton's attack, four attempted murders.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after the 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning 4:00 in Britain.
He was taken to a hospital where he's told he's in a stable state.
The police say that during the night, they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock region in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking for contacts for anyone who may have video material recorded on the mobile phone on events.
Trump says Kavanaugh's experience in the democratic party's evil and madness.
"My voice in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the disgusting and shameful methods of the democratic party," Trump said at the meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from the democratic party's "nasty and anger" throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh proved before the Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual harassment, which would have taken place decades ago in their teen years.
Ford also proved his accusation in the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said "Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, nature and courage" on that day.
"The voice in favour of confirming the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote on one of the most respected legal courses of our time with excellent seaweeds for public service," he told his supporters of West Virginia.
Indirectly, the President referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when speaking of the importance of the Republican voting activity in the interim elections.
"We're five weeks away from the main elections during our lifetime.
I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning full," he said.
"That's why I'm turning around all over to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats had assumed the task of "resisting and preventing."
The senior assistant of the Republican party leadership told the CNN that the first important vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to be held by the Senate no later than Friday.
In Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, hundreds of dead, the number of victims is expected to rise
On Saturday, at least 384 dead earthquake and tsunami were reported to the island of Sulawes in Indonesia. Many were wiped out with the giant waves that hit the coasts.
On Friday, there were hundreds of people gathered at the festival on the coast of the city, while up to six metres of waves hit the shore in the nightmare. Many were drowned to die when the waves destroyed everything.
Tsunam caused 7.5 magnitudi by strong earthquakes.
When the threat of tsunami emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach, and they did not escape immediately when they were victims of it," reports the Indonesian major accidents in the BNPB reporter in Purwo Nugroho Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, but it drew cars, trees, houses and hit all over the country," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached the open sea a speed of 800 km an hour before he hit the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing into the trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers at Palo.
The air photos published by the disaster agency show a number of devastated houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and water-circumcised mosques.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by the afterquakes.
Landquakes felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation of Indonesia issued a statement that the energy released in the great earthquake of Friday was equivalent to around 200 atomic bombs dropped in the Second World War in Hiroshima.
It says that the landscape of the city located at the end of the long and narrow sphere could swell tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "comprehensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had fallen.
He told me that some of the victims were found in the ruins of repressed buildings and added that 540 persons were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims of death and that the damage may be higher than the Palm 300 kilometres north of the continuous coast, in the area called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
The communication connections "are completely broken and no information from Donggala" says Nugroho.
According to the statement given by the Red Cross, over 300 000 people live there, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not telling the tsunami hit Palo, but the authorities said that the waves arrived during the warning.
In the social media amateur video, a man in the upper floor of the building shouts vigorously with warnings about approaching tsunami for people on the street.
Just minutes later, the beach is hit by a water wall that takes buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately verify the trueness of the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a wide cut of electricity that interrupted communication connections from around, please, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
The authorities tell us that the army has started to send help from Jakarta and other cities with transport machines, but you still need food and other basic supplies.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for aid measures and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims of Indonesian tsunami is above 800.
It's really bad.
The staff of the World Vision Donggala have access to security, please, the city where they are accommodationed in the tent roofs in the indoor yard, and on their way they passed the devastation scene, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
When the aid groups started their unsatisfactory task, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from traveling to the return.
According to Indonesia's provisions, funding, equipment and staff from abroad can only begin to flow when the area of accident has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"There is still a provincial disaster," says Aulia Arriani, an informant of the red cross in Indonesia.
"When the government says "OK, this is a national disaster", we can begin receiving international assistance, but the declaration has not yet been made."
When the second night landed, please after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family members of the lost hoped that their loved ones' miracle would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was lifted from the drain.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Societies team, had trained two encamped addicts for the Asian races that ended earlier this month.
The Roa Roa Hotel also trapped her students, says Mandagi.
"I have my own emotional burden as an older member of the pendant," he says.
Gendon tells us that he has tried desperately to reach the beach festival participants Please, competitors with WhatsApp messages after the news of Roa Roa's collapse was spread among the associations.
However, only one gray sign appeared after the messages he sent instead of two blue ones.
"That means I understand that no messages were received," he says.

Kanye West: The Flyer Changes to Ye
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday he wrote, "the character who used to be known as Kanye West".
Ye has been the nickname of a 41-year-old West for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album published in June.
The change precedes his future performance in the Saturday Night Live program, where he is expected to publish his new album named Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who, according to the creator, canceled his participation for "sensitive reasons".
West has previously told him that the word also has religious significance to him, not only is it a shorter of his professional name.
Speaking of the title of the album earlier this year with the radio broadcaster Big Boy, West said, "he believes that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you".
"So I'm you, we, and we're all.
It began from Kanya, which means the only one, and ended up in a shorter form of Ye, which only reveals the goodness, evil, confusion in us, just everything.
The album is mainly a reflection of who we are."
He's one of many known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known in a variety of names called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, she announced that she favoured the names of Love and Brother Love.
The former partner of West, JAY-Z, also, has removed and restored the link and large letters.
AMLO promise not to use an army against civilians
The Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against civilians, and that the report came on the 50-year-old day of revenge against students when he approached the country.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, promised not to use an army to oppress the people of Mexico.
The armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people during the time when left student movements were rooting in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young people in Mexico by providing monthly study support and by opening more free public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and training opportunities lead young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of an intellectual research
The US should double the funding used to study artificial intelligence when China enhances its activity. This is what says the sponsor and artist Kai-Fu Lee who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The opinion was preceded by notifications of the various parts of the U.S. administration, even though the United States lacked a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China has already presented its plan in the past year: it will endeavour to become a leading integer by 2030.
"Twice the budget of an intelligence study would be a good start to note that other countries are so many behind the United States, and that we are looking for an artificial intelligence of the next breakthrough," says Lee.
Duplication of funding could double the likelihood that the following major artificial intelligence would be carried out in the United States, Lee reported in this week's CNBC interview.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Factory: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO in Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of the most important Chinese art intelligence companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an art Intelligence System at Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the US highest ranked Othello player. Later he was headed by Microsoft Research and as head of Google's Chinese activities.
Lee acknowledged the previous technology competitions of the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next would be organized to identify future visioners.
Lee says US scientists worked hard to get public assistance.
"Academic influencers are not taking China, but large companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited universities in recent years to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up their artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think that those who have completed the PhD should automatically grant green cards," he said.
The Chinese Government of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other State organisations provide money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
The United States Ministry of Defence was established earlier this year by the Defense Department of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industrial and academic partners. The White House has also announced the formation of a special committee of artificial intelligence.
DARPA was also announced this month on the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
In turn, the NSF invests over $100 million per year in an artificial intelligence study.
At the same time, the legislative initiative aimed at the establishment of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intel has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in referendum amending the name of the country
In the Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted to turn the name of the country into the North-Makedonian Republic.
In the view of Greece with the region of Macedonia, the name of the northern neighbour is in practice a regional requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its access to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries concluded an agreement on a new nominal proposal, but nationalists believe that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he is not going to vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the required 50% limit of voting activity is reached in order to ensure that the result is legal.
The question in the voting flag was: "Would you be on the side of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of a change of names like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, which has become a member of the EU and NATO, has become a member.
"I came today to vote in favour of the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska Skopje, a 79-year-old.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive impact.
This will require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Board, no irregularities had been reported by 13:00.
However, the voting activity was only 16, compared to 34% of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, where 66% of the voters finally voted.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted for the capital of Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum on the change of name in Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and put a referendum to the tents set by the boikotoes in front of the Skopje Parliament.
"We are bringing NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up and not through the kitchen door, said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to another one, such as China and Russia as part of the integration of the euro area".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership is bringing dignified investments in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe the large majority will vote in favour of a change in the name, because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," said Zaev after giving their vote.
He said "yes" is "failing our future."
On Monday, the survey of opinions published by my Political Research Institute of Macedonia referred to the 30-43% voting activity in the referendum, i.e. less than the required activity.
In the second survey by the Telma TV made by Macedonia, 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said that they would vote in favour of the 'yes' option.
In order to succeed in the referendum, the voting activity must be exceeded by 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious recession of the Western government as it came into power in May last year.
See: Manchester City Sergio Aguero defeated the whole defense of Brighton with his goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made clear evidence of Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At 65 minutes, Aguero made the paint look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the picture, the Argentiinan top player received an input from the middle field.
He found an empty space on the field by running through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero noticed that four green shirts were surrounded.
He blew past one defender and then left several others on the edge of the Brighton punishment area.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English top used his first touch within the penal zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton watch on Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot in the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists that "Aguero has problems with his legs."
"We talked about playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he made a goal in that time."
However, Sterling had already given the heavens an advantage in the conflict of choice.
The paint came with 29 minutes of play.
In the situation, Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful penetration on the left.
Sane took a few touches before he sent the ball to the back of Sterling.
The sky blue attacker kicked the ball net just before the end limit.
City meets the Hoffenheim Championship in the section of the Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 Rhein-Neckar-Arenalla in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a cheerleader in the fight against Rockies.
Nationals is out of the drop fight, so why forcedly try to start a meeting?
However, Scherzer always hopes to take over the stove in the Sunday fight against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a drop-off show, they have one win-off in the Western series of Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies picked up at least a wild card with 5-2 wins from Nationals on Friday night, but they're still targeting their first division goal.
"Although we don't have a stake, we can at least get up to the EBU, knowing that the atmosphere of the audience and the second team here in Denver creates the most demanding competitive arrangement I have encountered this year.
Why would I not want to accept the challenge?"
Nationals have not yet published their starter for Sunday, but according to information, they tend to give Scherzer a chance in these circumstances.
Scherzer was throwing a rehearsal on Thursday, playing 34 at the start of his fight and eating it on Sunday at his normal rest shift.
Washington's right-handed player has 18-7 profit/loss ratio in this period. The ERA statistics are 2.53 and he has burned the hitter's nest 300 times, with 220 2/3 of the double statistics.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the election activity of the Republicans in the interim elections.
"All our achievements are in the game in November.
We're five weeks away from the main elections during our lifetime.
This is one of the really big ones -- not just campaigns, but campaigns full, and so I'm going to turn around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to the harlot any way they can, and you can see their evilness and evil desires.
They will not choose who is harming, or who must be squeezed, so that they may gain power; that they will, power, and power, but we will not give it to them.
He said that the democrats have assumed the task of 'resisting and preventing'.
"And it has been visible in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "to be hateful and wicked and lying."
When he referred to the longest democratic player in the Committee on Justice of the Senate, Dianne Feinstein, the public responded with sound bouquets.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Eh, uh, what.
Well, no, I'm waiting for a little... it was really bad body language... from the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerance congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions
I wasn't really surprised when my local political party, Mr Momentum activists, supported the motion of distrust against me.
I am, at least, only the last representative of the line of Labour, who is told that I am not welcome - just because we say our opinions.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because he was firmly opposed to antisemitism.
In my case, the distrust statement was a criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues relating to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, are ironically similar to those of which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that we want our meetings to be participatory and productive.
Most of the eight years I have been a representative of the local Labour, the Fridays of the Pentecost Council have been the same.
Now, many meetings do not follow that noise, and the "friendly and more gentle" policy has long ago been forgotten if it even started.
It is even more clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates different opinions and that each opinion is evaluated on the basis of whether it is suitable for the party's leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and the colleagues with whom I thought I had shared a similar political view began to expect from me a full translation and positions that I would never have accepted, whether it was national security or the internal market in the EU.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result of an insult belt in the social media that requires my choice to be withdrawn, the rejection of central policy, and I can hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I do know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are of a political nature.
I greatly respect the professionality and determination of my colleagues who face sexual and racist insults every day and never deteriorate.
The normalisation of illicit treatment is one of the most disturbing features of the policy of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corby demanded that the Labour Party adopt a tolerance culture.
In fact, we are no longer a party accepting different opinions, and every motion or change in the rules of confidence will be more limited.
For two years, I have been urged to keep a low profile and to refrain from expressing my thoughts so that everything would go well.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the failure of the Government of Thatcher to the Single School, I am both a city councilman and a minister's duties to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I've never covered my political line, not even in last elections.
No one in Nottingham East's constituency could have surprised my views or disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the state moves towards the brexet that affects households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my trust in the management of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with respect, and the threat or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your best interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Unbeatable in Ayr blockage
The last two goals were slightly distorted by the outcome of the fight, but Ayr undeniably earned the victory of the day in the entertaining Tennent's Premiership.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team from ten who have not lost any fights.
Excellent defense and more successful risk-taking was ultimately what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie could reasonably be satisfied.
"We've been challenged in our fights, and we're still invincible, so I can be happy." he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All honors to Ayri, they took risks better than us."
Ayr went to lead at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversio kick, but the Skotlanian captain Roy Hughes' yellow card, who was handed over to Warriors, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot made a goal.
Climo raised Ayri's leadership in the penitentiary painting, and just before the half time he made the goal and succeeded in the conversio-potting, raising Ayri's leadership to read 17-5.
But Melrose started another round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, which Baggot succeeded in the conversio kick, narrowing the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the fight when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and taken out of the field. Ayr continued to raise his lead on the goal of Stafford McDowall, whose conversio kick Climo succeeded.
Ayri's Captain Blair Macphererson got a yellow card, followed by Melrosen Bruce Colvine's hard-pressure goal that the conversio kick failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tacking the ballless Climo, and Macpherson made a goal behind the Ayri's painting that left the side limit.
Climo succeeded in a conversio kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's kick and zipped Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal of the home team.
The star of Still Game will begin in the restaurant sector
The star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran has been appointed manager of the licensed restaurant company and should also start working in the restaurant sector.
A 56-year-old actress presents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program he's handwriting with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next ninth season is the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the public records, he has been designated as director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in the flourishing restaurant business of Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": the home country of Bolivia is trying to get back into contact with the Pacific Ocean by way of justice
Seamen patrol outside the Navy base in La Paz.
In the public buildings, the sea blue flag is floating.
The bases of the Navy from Titicaca to Amazon have been strangled by the strike clause: "The sea is rightly ours.
It's our duty to get it back."
In Bolivia, which was left in the home country, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody war in the 1800s is still strong – as is the trailing of the Pacific Ocean once again.
The hope is highest for decades when Bolivia expects the International Court to decide on 1 October after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has a strong progression, coexistence, and, of course, a positive attitude in waiting for a final solution," said Bolivia diplomat Roberto Calzad.
Several Bolivians all over the country will hopefully follow the decision of the International Court on large screens, hoping that in the Hague, at the end of the decades of the debate, Bolivia has a duty to grant itself access to the sea in Bolivia.
The Bolivian charismatic President, Evo Morales, who faces the re-election of the contested fight next year, is a lot in the game next Monday.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he convinced me at the end of August.
However, some of the analysts believe that the Court is likely not to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it were to be decided, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch institution does not have the power to dispose of the management areas of Chile, and the ICJ has also announced that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the ICJ is only six months after the final statements refers to the fact that the case is not complicated, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than contributed to Bolivia's objectives.
"The current Bolivian government has taken the question of maritime connection," said Zárate.
The retomics that challenged Morales has suppressed the rest of the goodwill of the chiles, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the debate at some point, but it will be very difficult to organise negotiations after this.
There has been no second embassy in either country since 1962.
The former President and the representative of Bolivia in Haagi, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the judgment of the Court had been exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia the "exceptive opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity "to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzad also contradicts that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the issue of maritime transport as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to contact with the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea announced that the nuclear assault will not take place unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first, unless they can trust Washington, said the North Korea Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
The position of the Rin came just before the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo was relaunching the deadly diplomacy with nuclear weapons, only three months after the United States met Kim Jong Unin in Singapore.
Ri said that it was a "distorted dream" to believe that the continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to the Korean war ending declaration would bring North Korea to their knees.
Before Pjongjang has first taken significant measures from weapons to promote withdrawal, Washington is prepared to accept the declaration.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump of the United States want a new summit.
But the view that Pjongjang would intend to give up the arms arsenal, which the State is likely to see as the only real means of guaranteeing its own safety, has had a large degree of doubt.
Pompeo intends to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the next Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion exhibitions present the large sizes of the latest model, which will soon be on your next street.
If you want to increase your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not need to continue searching.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 model show a range of special super-sized headlines that would spoil the style circles of the Paris fashionweek.
Instagram was captured this summer by very un pragmatic peasants, and these designers have also sent their astonishing creations to the fashion shows.
Valentino’s most impressive creation was a beige hat with a wide feather lining, covering almost all the heads of the models.
Other oversized clothing were, among other things, my water juice decorated with jewelry, wizard hat and even ananas — but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of isolated masks – just right before Halloween.
In several coloured masks, lips had been stirred, and they were more like Hannibal Lecter than a top fashion.
One creature with a snorcle and mask reminded me of a more submersive device, and the other reminded me of the melted ice cream.
And if you want to take a position for a large-sized fashion, you're lucky.
The successors of the fashion predict that huge scarves are about to appear in the street picture.
The sizes of the hats are strictly followed by "La Bombaa", a straw hat with a liar of half a metre, which has been seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
In the social media, the cults of an unprudent hat also embedded another sized creation into the fashion exhibitions — a collar bag made of a shoulder, which is almost as large as the model bearing it.
A raffle bar with a burned orange decoration was the most impressive creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 model in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large sizes of hats and wristbags in the street picture next summer – designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore demand for large sizes of clothing."
John Edward: language skills is a key skill for the people of the world
Skotlanian private schools have traditionally been good and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of the good results of the experiments, which have been enhanced by individual and community success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of over 30 000 students located across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools SCIS, seek to provide a high level of service for their students and for the parents of students.
Private schools are trying to prepare their students for their chosen careers, further education and higher education, as well as the world's nationality.
As a educational sector operator, which can design and implement customised content of learning, we have noticed the status of languages as a recommended and hoped educational instrument in the institutions.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in the language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to create relations with the people of other countries.
From the latest results of this year, we see that the languages are at the top of the lists for the percentage of access between private schools.
68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest rating of A.
The material was collected from 74 schools belonging to SCIS. Based on the material, it was found that students who received the best rating A, 72 percent of the mandarin Chinese, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that Scottish private schools support studying foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently free-selling substances, but they are regarded as being the same as scientific materials (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in private schools and elsewhere.
On the basis of the survey made by the British Employment Office in 2014, 17% of the situations in which the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee was explained by lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary to promote career development for young people in the future.
The more possible work tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills are formed in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he will have a privilege in the future for this lifelong skill, despite what career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with the foreigner to automatically put a language-skilled person ahead of the competition.
According to the survey made by YouGov in 2013, over 4,000 adults in IsoBritannia are unable to speak in a foreign language, and France was the only language involved in a double-digit figure of 15 per cent.
That is why it is important to invest in teaching languages for the current children.
In particular, knowing the languages of developing countries will give children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
In Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are supposed to be important for the IsoBritannia people in 2020, such as mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite your child’s interest, private schools always have a number of language options as instructed by specialist teachers.
The Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and provides them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future will bring.
In this time, it cannot be denied that the international business environment continues to play a very important role in the future of the country, so this must reflect education.
Today's languages should indeed be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high-level youths in Scotland.
Il faut bien faire.
John Edward is head of the SCIS of the Scottish Council of Private Schools
LeBron's making a debyet on Sunday in San Diego.
The expectation of LeBron James' first visit to the Los Angeles Lakers line is almost over.
Coach Luke Walton of the Lakers has announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the beginning of the season.
But how many minutes he's really playing, stay to see.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48" said Walton Lakers on the official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is probably playing indefinite minutes.
Earlier this week, James, following trainings, was asked about his plans for the six fights to play before the Lakers.
"In this phase of my career, I don't need any more pre-treatment to prepare for my pre-treatment," he said.
Time for the Trump Western Virginia campaign, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign for election today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first from five next week electoral events, including condolences, such as Tennesse and Mississippi.
As the vote awaits, Trump is seeking to increase support for future interim elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in the Congress elections in November.
What time is Trump's Western Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
The event of Trump West Virginia Wheeling begins at 19 pm in the Eastern Coast on Saturday 29 September8.
You can view Trump’s Western Virginia campaign event online as a livestock trip through YouTube by clicking below.
Trump should have taken the position to hold this week's Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who became charged with intense sexual harassment, which has delayed the Senate confirmation vote at a week in the FBI's investigation.
But the priority for the campaign is to support the success of the Republican candidates in the tight elections in November.
Consequently, President Trump's campaign commented on the five events of the next week to "revive voluntary and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Government of Congress is so essential to his purpose that the President is ready to travel to as many states as possible during the busy campaign period", the nominal representative of the Trump campaign told Reuters.
Today's event is located in Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and there can be arriving supporters even from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports the senator candidate Patrick Morrisey of the Republicans in West Virginia, who has been left behind in the opinion measurements.
"For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the President is trying to increase his support for opinion measurements," said State scientist Simon Haeder from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team shows the battle will to maintain hope before Sunday alone games
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's four-games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-evident power of success is a fully invented phenomenon in sport, players believe in it, and even more in tournaments like this.
Where is this prosperity, with them at the moment?
"They had a six-point headline, which narrowed down to four, so we take this successive power as a glimpse," said Jordan Spieth, walking away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has a privilege: four points ahead and 12 playable.
The United States, as Spieth said, experience that they have a little wind in the sails and much of which to encourage, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas, which they played together all day and got three points from four.
Spieth has been overwhelming from the road to the green, and leads with an example.
The twisted throat sounds of the winning party became stronger when he progressed, when he succeeded in a critical pipe to balance the match even to four, when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
Putt, in which they won the 15th match followed a similar scream that gave the idea that he believed that the US team has not yet lost.
"You need to concentrate very well and take care of your own fight," Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to make an effect.
The only players who have received more points when Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cupin's undeniable legends of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special, but the sweet twin has won four out of four mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only twin that didn't make any bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way in which they give and receive energy from this gloomy audience confirms that they are the prior favorites of Sundays. And when the sun drops in Le Golf National, the second most popular player in Europe could not be able to ensure the potential victory of Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather both be on different holes at the same time.
However, speeches on European success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly flourished with Alex Noren, Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the four-game in the morning.
One bog and two double bogs in the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedish into so deep a hole that they were not close to survival.
But on Sunday, no one's gonna help you out of the hole.
Four balls and square games are fascinating to follow from a close couple of cooperation perspectives: what kind of advice they give or fail to give, and how the strategy can change in the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant leadership position before the last day, but this quadrant showed that the US team has a battle wish, even though it has been suspected in the United States in particular.
Europe takes 10-6 lead before Ryder Cupin's last day
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup after they took 10-6 leading positions from the United States in Saturday's four balls and quadrants.
The great double Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led a winning trip in two wins from Tiger Woods, and scored four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who worked hard to preserve the victory in Hazeltine two years ago, undergoing a weakly played U.S. team in the four-ball in the morning, taking 3-1 of the fight.
The United States was a harder opponent in the quadruples, winning two fights, but they were unable to narrow down the leadership position.
Jim Furyk's half needed eight points from Sunday 12 to double to keep the victory.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner, who has won four points consecutively. He and Molinari, also called "Molliwood", were the second two in Ryder Cup's history after the sensational weekend, which has won four points in the first four games.
After bursting in the four-ball, Woods and Patrick Reed, they then finished overwhelmingly down Woods and Bryson Dechambeau, the United States beginner, Bryson Dechambeau, even more prosperously 5-4.
Woods, who barely survived through the two games on Saturday, was occasionally very brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and square games, and up to seven consecutives.
Justin Rose rested the four balls in the morning, but with Henrik Stenson, he returned to the square game, but he lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the ranking.
Europe did not have everything in its desire in this gentle and pleasant day from Paris to southwest.
The triangle winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the United States at two points on Saturday.
They're going to get 2-1 wins from the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls, and then 4-3 wins from Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-game after the first two holes have been lost.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, the team has risen from the four-point drive to the levels at the start of double games, even though on the Fury side, the match is enough to keep the winning.
However, after two days, the second best may be that the Sunday counterattack has been too much asked.
North Korea, "no in any name", take off weapons without trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions only increased confidence in the United States, and in these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures" over the last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantled a nuclear test site and promised that North Korea would not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technologies.
"However, we haven't seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"The confidence in the United States cannot be certain of the preservation of national security, so in such circumstances, it is not possible to take our weapons from one side."
Although Ri reiterated the familiar complaint stream that Washington does not accept the gradual abandonment of nuclear weapons in which North Korea would be rewarded for every intermediate topic, his statement is, however, significant in the sense that unilateral weapons are not completely excluded, as Pjongjang has previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit of the President of the United States and North Korea at the Summit in Singapore on 12 June, Kim persuaded "the taking off of nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought to formally decide the war between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pjongjang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States demand "the nuclear strippers first" and have increased pressures by means of sanctions to achieve their targets by force – even opposing the "rest declaration", Ri said.
"Translation that the sanctions will bring us to our knees is unindifferent wish.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention the plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed the three meetings with the South Korea leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the parties to disguise would be South Korea and the United States, the situation would not have evolved into such a dead end."
Yet, Ri's voice was significantly different from last year, when he told at the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the United States continental regions was inevitable after the "evil President" Trump called Kim "the missile man" with suicide intentions.
Even last year, Trump threatened to "destroy completely" of North Korea. In this year, however, Trump commended Kim in a very lowly way about this courage to approach the abandonment of weapons, but stressed, however, that there is still a lot left to work and the sanctions must remain for as long as North Korea renounces nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump mentioned that he has no time limit: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should be rewarded for the progress already made by Pjongjang.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council that "the strengthening of the sanctions of the Security Council should continue to be strong and unsuccessful until we prove a complete, final and reinforced release of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of blocking the financing channels for the production of Pjongjang ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Pompeo met at the UN General Assembly of the North Korea Rin, and also announced that he would return to Pjongjang next month for the preparation of the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit did not go smoothly.
However, North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsterical requirements" only a few hours later.
North Korea committed to the closure of the missile base and nuclear installation in the meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month in the case of the United States taking "conforming measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "compliant measures" security guarantees to which Trump committed at the Singapore meeting and moving towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are performing an adequate course for resting.
All graduate students at the University of Harvard will attend this year to a course aimed at increasing students' rest. The course is a counterpart to a flourishing machoculture in which students weigh for a long night with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the world’s best university are often quite ignorant in fundamental matters related to their own well-being.
The course was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler of the University of Harvard Medical Science, who works with a sleeping study at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first of his species in the United States.
Czeisler got an idea for the course after he lectured on the effect of sleeping shortages on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me, who said, "Why do I hear about it only now, in my last year of study?"
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising," he told me in the Telegraph interview.
For the first time this year, the course guides students how true unitings support academic and sporting performances and improve general well-being.
Professor of the University of Harvard Medical Science and Vice-President of the University of Health Services Paul Barreira says that the university has ended up organizing a course after they heard how students suffer from serious sleep deficiencies during the study week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section shows students a picture of the apartment room where the student can click on cafés, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus obtain information on the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deficiencies on sporting activities and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiencies can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The Kampus map with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
"We know that this has no immediate effect on the behaviour of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know these matters in the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," Professor Czeisler adds.
According to Professor Czeisler, all-night studyumarates are still a topic of pride, and today’s technology and the growing pressures of students made a growing problem of sleep shortages.
"Accurring sufficient and high-quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even increasing weight, as sleep shortage causes a condition similar to starvation in the brain, which is why people are constantly hungry", the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical psychology student in California, helped Professor Czeisler to design a course after he had attended one of his teaching courses for the first year in Harvard last year.
He says that the course opened his eyes and pushed all the campus students to organize a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all further students could carry out a similar set of studies before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set a wake-up clock also remind them of sleeping time in addition to morning awakening, and urges them to keep in mind the side effects of electronic screening devices and the "blue light" of the LED light on the day-to-day grids, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot took a win from Gerrardi's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers had another defeated day again, when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defence brought Livingston 1 to 0 victory.
But Gary Holt's team took the victory this time, and Gerrard only suffered his second defeat during his 18-game manager's career. Rangers stayed eight points away from the current head of the valioliiga.
Menga shot the ball to the goal of seven minutes before the half time, and there was no further correction of the situation with Rangers' fallen battle.
The Rangers fell to the sixth place as a result of the game. Livingston has climbed to the third place, and only Hibernia is above the goal difference.
The Rangers may also have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game as the guest catalog hit the object thrown in the head and the wound had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight exchanges to the assembly where the team had hit Ayri and progressed to the semi-finals of the Scotland League.
Holt continued with the Livi 11 assembly, where the team took the point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again produced results when a well-built configuration managed to discipline the opponent in almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better to use the situations for its own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to get the goal in two minutes, when the first input of Menga gave Scott Pittman a free way to the goal of Allan McGregor, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
After that, Keaghan Jacobs led his free shot to Craig Halkett, but the other defendant Alan Lithgow managed to only shoot widely in the back.
On the other hand, Rangers took control of the game, but at the last third of the game, there was no confidence in the air anymore.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment at 15 minutes after he and Steven Lawless had encountered each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals on the first half. However, Liam Kelly, former Ibrox's goalkeeper, rejected the invincible shot of Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejarian.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not merely due to the hard work of the team.
Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long feed tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher baited Scott Robinson, who cold-fashioned the ball to Menga for easy paint.
At the switcher, Gerrard decided to change Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field.
Livingston put visitors to play their own game again, while Lithgow and Halkett continued long inputs after each other.
The Holt team had the opportunity to increase its leadership at the last moments of the game. However, the fine defense of McGregor prevented Jacobs from making plans before Lithgow got to its positions in the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came from the Rangers exchange, also demanded a prosecution after he joined Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanakka: Geiger Meter inventor
Next page of our Sunday Morning apple: 30 September 1882. John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physicist, was born today in Germany 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a known device as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the support pillars of science and also the key concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado watches", which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are performing the most impressive scientists of livestock shepherds:
The man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter, it's used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals."
Evans, "Look at it, it really does!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
The invention that wears his name, though, still lives.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
In the method, resistance cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory.
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are capable of ‘see’ typical proteins for several cancers
The dog test has shown promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, cancer cells in patients with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In this method, resistance cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” typical HER2 proteins for several cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, the National Institute of Cancer in the United States, Bethesda, describes the method: "On the basis of our results, it is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "to control the growth of several types of cancer", Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer and eat egg cancer, lungs and thick bowels."
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also resulted in a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West was caught in critics' teeth after praising Trumpia on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat in his head.
The presentation didn't go according to the plan.
Kanye West received bouquets in his neck in the Saturday Night Live entertainment program, praised by the staggering style of President Donald Trump and announced that he was seeking to be president in the 2020 elections.
After tonight's third song "Ghost Town" by Trump's Make America Great Again campaign, West attacked the Democrats and repeated his support to President Trump.
"When they talked to a white man, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
Tonight's broadcast began with a sketches, where Matt Damon dismissed Brett Kavanaugh's consultation in the Senate Legal Committee, which relates to the claims made by Christine Blasey Ford by Kavanaugh's sexual harassment.
West's fasting was not presented in a direct broadcast, but the comic Chris Rock downloaded it to the social media.
I don't know if Rock's intending to mock West with his postage.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been treated for the sake of his hat.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me I shouldn't go on stage with this hat in my head.
I've been tempted!
And then they say I'm in the margin," West says in the Washington Examiner interview.
West continues, "Do you want to see what being in the margin means?" and he says he's dressed for Superman's link, 'cause you can't tell me what I'm doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
According to Varied, West's comments bounced bouquets from the audience at least twice, and the performers of the show seemed embarrassed. One of the presents described the situation to the newspaper as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was selected to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend Mac Miller, was dead a few days earlier.
In many viewers, West caused confusion by showing the song "I love it" as a bottle of Perrier.
West receives support from the leader of the Conservative TPUSA Organization, Candace Turner, who praised this courage in Twitter: "WITH HOW TO ROSKAVÄKE".
However, the conductor of the discussion program Karen Hunter referred that West is "only self, which is all of a wonderful one".
"I can, however, decide to have someone (buying this music or wardrobe or supporting this "art") which I believe supports and disseminates harmful ideology for my community.
He's a free man.
The same applies to us," he added.
Prior to his presentation on Twitter, the journalist announced that he changed his name as "person who was formerly known as Kanye West."
West is not the first artist to change his name, and the musician here follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we remember the late music legend Prince, who replaced his name as a symbol and later an artist known before as Prince.

The actor star of the throne game, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculineism
Kit Harington is known for a sword from his glowing heroic role in the violent fantasy series of Jon Snow'na HBO.
However, Harrington has attacked a machosankar against a stereotype: according to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with strength.
In the interview with the Sunday Times cultural link, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong" and questiones the means available to intervene with the toxic masking of the #MeToo event in the era.
Harrington, a recently married to Rose Leslie, who belongs to the Stargate of the Pentecost, also admits that he has a strong desire to intervene.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity is that I am at the moment arousing strong emotions," he says.
"What have men been taught about their growth in years that have led to problems that can now be seen?"
Harrington believes that TV and its very maskulinous characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic maskulinism.
He goes, "What's from inner births, and what is it that's learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel that they have to be certain to be men?
I believe that this is one of the major issues of our time – how can we change this?
Young men have something really bad."
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the preparts or consecutive parts of the throne game after the end of the series next summer, because he has said that he has had enough of the battlefields and horses.
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells about the film producer and his robber brother.
Recently, the actor revealed that getting to know his future wife, Rose, was the best thing that the throne game has offered him.
"I met my wife in this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on," she says.
Rose Leslie was playing Ygritte, the target of Jon Snow's love in a fantasy series prized by Harrington.
The couple was married in June 2018 at the farms of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: The number of new infections has increased in China by 14%
China has announced an increase in the number of its HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens by 14%.
According to health authorities, the virus affects more than 820 000 lives in the country.
Approximately 40 000 new cases have only been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has rapidly spread through transfusions in some parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities in the Yunnan County conference, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
One year later, however, the number of HIV-infected and AIDS-infected people in China has risen in 100,000 cases.
HIV infections through sex are an acute question in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination between LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women because of the conservative values of the country.
Many of these diseases are due to insufficient protection in such relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to ensure the overall availability of HIV medicines as part of the measures aimed at solving the problem.
Maxine Waters contradicts the information of the employee who leaked the Republican generator and accuses the dissemination of "dangerous lies" and "secret alloy theories"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. representative room, Maxine Waters objected to claims that his employees had published personal information on three republicans on Wikipedia’s websites.
The Democratic Representative from Los Angeles confirmed that there were commentaries and websites for "extremists".
"White, lies and more despicable lies," says Waters in Twitter's statement.
It is reported that the addresses and phone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, who represent South Carolina, as well as Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, representing Utah, were registered.
The unknown person published information on Thursday of the United States Congress during the consultation of the Senate Committee, on charges against sexual abuse against the candidate Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred a little after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that Hill's newspaper reported that the messages were published by the IP address attached to Waters' office and by the person involved in Waters' staff.
"This unjustified accusation is completely wrong, and it's about absolute lies," Water continued.
"My worker, whose identity, personal data and security have been endangered by these sincere and false accusations, is not in any form responsible for leaking these data.
This unjustified accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters’ opinion quickly criticised the Internet, and a former press secretary of the White House was also accompanied by critics, Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denys this is very hostile," said Fleischer.
"It seems that his nature is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to act hostile.
There's no reason for despair.
There's no reason to question the motives of the prosecutor.
In the situation, you should behave calmly and calmly."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism against Judge Kavanaugh, accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters in Congress's interim elections, has also expressed its view in Twitter.
"I can't believe if this is true," he's your tweet.
In its opinion, Waters announced that he had contacted "competent authorities and law enforcement bodies for these sincere accusations.
"We ensure that the authors are exposed," he continued, "and that they will be legally held accountable for any disastrous and dangerous action against some or all of my staff members."
Johnny English is hitting again – a sub-efficient Rowan Atkinson agent parodah
The tradition has already been established to search for brexit references to any of the films that are in the UK, but it does not seem suitable for Johnny English agent industry and the operative media series that started in 2003 on the Johnny English track and revived back to the "Johnny English – Newborn".
Can the language of the nation's satires in cheek be a new national export advance in Britain?
So, like this, a skull-eyed, glamoured and incompetent Johnny English has earned his permission to retreat for the second time, and his name is above all about the fact that it is a comic creation that is directed to the film market outside the English-language world.
It is, of course, the stubborn secret agent who desperately tries to live around a melting glamour, but it appears to be a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and the unhappy one-whole musician at the 2012 opening concert in London.
A cosmopolit and a mystical world man who was originally presented by Atkinson in the unforgettable Barclaycard TV commercials has left behind the chaos.
But the last presentation has its moments.
I particularly liked the scene where Johnny English arrives on a helicopter with a medieval armor dressed, and his helmets are crushed by the stages of the roottor.
Atkinson’s physical comedy gifts come out, but the humor itself seems to be a sub-efficient and strange needless, especially because ‘standing’ film brands, such as 007 and Dangerous task, now provide humor as part of the main content of the film.
The humor affects the children, and Johnny English's psychic treatment does not seem to me as inventive and sharp-looking as Mr. Bean's musical roles.
Every year, the recurring starting point is that Britain is a worse time in trouble.
The cyber hacker is infiltrated into the British high-secret spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents working on the field as a shock of an agent, which is presented as Kevin Eldon's unfortunately small role.
This is the last drop to the prime minister of importance and stainlessness, who is already in the heart of political discomfort: Emma Thompson does everything in the skin of the Teresa May parodia figure, but the manuscript does not offer him enough space.
When she is informed by the intelligence counselors that all spies on the field have been revealed, someone who has already moved away from the active service must be called urgently.
It is, of course, a twisting Johnny English in its own personality. He spends his retirement days as a teacher at a finest school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble skills of spying. The subject is advocating some smart jokes; English keeps School of Rock-type lessons in the field of intelligence.
English will be praised to the emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he meets Bough, his endless, patient partner, who is still acting by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to have access to his rights.
Thus, the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service to face the fateful supercriminatory Ophelia Bhuletova acted by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is going to be manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, acting by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve the British computer problems.
The odyssei of English and Bough are transformed into farss right away: the two who are masked as waiters will light a fine French restaurant in the fire and cause chaos in the secret pursuit of Volta's luxury yachts. The company will study the house of Volta with virtual glasses end up in a pure anarchia in the real world.
Even the last obstacles of the authors will go to the end of the scene, but despite all the powerlessness and charmingness, the film still seems to be a bit made to the child’s audience.
You can keep the movie moderate.
When I watched Johnny English movies, I've decided to think about the same thing before: why is the British cinema industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for the four-day working week with five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn's headed Labour is considering a radical plan that the British would work for four days a week, but the salary would be paid for five days.
The party is told that it would require business leaders to transfer the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution to workers in the form of extra holidays.
The plan suggests that workers could enjoy the three-day weekends with the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of the party's economic programme and its plans to cost a policy for the benefit of the workers.
The Central Organisation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economic situation.
The source of the High Level Workers' Party tells the Sunday Times: "Inspection has been notified before the change of the year.
There is no change in the moment, but the four-day working week is the objective of the party's approach to economic balancing for workers, as well as the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the British Green Party committed itself to support the transition to the four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective must not be undistributed in the labour line.
The informant of the Labour Party notes: "The four-day working week is not the party's line, and the party is not considering such a shift."
Mr John McDonnell, Minister of Finance of the Shadow Government, took advantage of the work conference held last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said that he was determined to recover power from "green dictators" and "trainers" of general interest companies.
According to the plans of the Minister for Finance of the Shadow Government, the current shareholders of the water companies should not be able to regain their share as a whole because the government led to the Labour could implement 'reductions' on the basis of the abuses observed.
He also confirmed the plans to set employees into corporate governance and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10 % of private sector companies' share capital to the management of employees, with a plan to pay up to GBP 500 per year in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing 60 minutes of the program on whether the FBI investigation about Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The investigation of charges against the FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week's final vote on Kavanaugh's appointment as judge of the Supreme Court, and the delay also raises the question whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republicanists to Kavanaugh's appointment.
In the 60-minute period to be sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Party for Senate John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could be possible for the FBI to find out things that could help them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague under South Carolin.
"Then, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said by the time I heard you... I said that I've had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, when the accusations came out, and I asked him, ‘ Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Instead, Graham's voice looks like a stone washed.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's a bomb secure," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett firmly denied it," Graham added to Christine Blasey Ford.
"No one of the people he named was able to confirm.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see what could change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival in New York, is a music event with a performing card as impressive as its mission: to remove poverty from the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now the seventh time, attracts tens of thousands of people to the lawns of the New York Central Park to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make the real goal of the event known: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, which started in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aimed at eliminating poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to eradicate poverty.
In order to obtain a free ticket to the event (if it is not willing to pay the VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or "works" such as voluntary work, send an e-mail to the political decision-makers or make a call, or perform another act that disseminates awareness of the objectives of the project.
But how has the Global Citizen been successful now that there are 12 years left to achieve the objective?
Is the free concert ticket the idea of rewarding a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clictivism’ among others — the idea that the world can be changed by signing a web address or sending a TV player?
The Global Citizen declares its records of more than 19 million "work" on behalf of the various objectives since 2011.
Accordingly, these acts have encouraged policy-makers to report commitments and principles corresponding to more than $37 billion, which have been used in a way that affects more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations on the basis of which more than $10 billion has already been used or collected.
The group estimates that the funds achieved have already had an impact on the lives of almost 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, the The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in the United Kingdom, which has committed to "to help children develop their potential to full". The group committed to deliver EUR 35 million to Rwanda for the conclusion of a subtle diet in the country. This happened after the activists sent them 4,700 tvs as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, the governments of different countries, and just like you, the people of the world like you, we can transfer social injustice and under-food history to the newspapers", said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of Power of Nutrition, to the audience in the concert held in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British Government was also invited to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by more than 5 000 actions. The government has published funding for the anti-fooding Power is Nutrition project, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions often asked on the movement's website is: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen's answer: "It will become long and difficult and there will be many compass stones ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as major civil rights fights and movements against the Apartheid before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman run the New York concert this year, and its star map includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Interior, the country can make energy exports difficult by using the Navy as a "prevention"
According to the United States Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner, Washington can "if necessary" rely on its fleet to help prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including the nearest ones.
Zinke argues that Russia’s activities in Syria — the calling of the legal government — are an excuse for the recognition of the new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the reason for the presence of [Russia] in the Middle East is energy supply, just like in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," said Zinken.
According to the authorities, there are ways and means to prevent this.
"The United States have the ability to keep the shipping routes open with the help of their fleet and, if necessary, by harboring, to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up on the world market", he says.
Zinke spoke to the general public of the event organised by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group, which is profiled as a "consumer voice storm" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this is one and the same thing.
"Iran and Russia's economic alternative is more or less speculation, and the replacement of fuel on one side", he says, and describes Russia as a "one trick circus number", which is based on fossil fuels.
The opinions are due to a situation where Trump's administration has sought to enhance the exports of liquid natural gas to Europe and to replace the much cheaper Russian liquidated natural gas.
In order to enhance this, the Trump regime, including President Trump, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, binds Berlin to Moscow's rehabilitation.
Moscow has repeatedly weighted the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project to double the capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres of the existing pipeline is a purely economic project.
Kreml claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington's opposition, and considers it an example of unhealthy competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers must have the opportunity to choose its supplier", says Russia's Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak, after meeting the US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States' attitude has caused a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial roofing organisation, the German Industrial Union, has called on the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel very problematic about the involvement of the third country in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Director of the German Industry Central Union, recently after meeting the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, intends to carefully consider the candidate for the presidential elections in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetz, announced on Saturday that he'd carefully consider becoming presidential candidate after the interim elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidate for an open questionnaire in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's women's time to move to Washington and correct our faulty government, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom", he said according to The Hill.
After the sixth day of November, I'm going to think carefully about becoming presidential candidate.
Warren judged President Donald Trump during the occasion by saying, "It's going to be taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," he says.
Warren has acted as a direct criticism of Trumpia and of the candidates of this Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in his receipt, Warren wrote, "Of course we need FBI research before we vote."
However, according to the request for opinion published on Thursday, the majority of the voters of Warren do not support this condition in 2020.
According to the research carried out by the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts do not support the position of the senator.
32% supported candidateship.
More of the respondents to the survey supported the position of former Governor Deval Patrick with 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other nominal candidates for democratic elections in 2020, such as former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, were raised in the debates.
According to the Associated Press News Office, Biden said he would formally decide on his candidate by January.
Sarah Palin refers to his son's war trauma at Donald Trump's electoral event
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and he was charged with family violence.
"What my own son will have to go through after coming home, I can well identify other families who will face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our soldiers will bear home", he told the audience meeting at the Oklahoma Donald Trump election event.
Palin called the arrest "flow horse in the living room" and said his son, like the other war veterans, "return home slightly, they return in hard, they return to wonder whether to respect what he and his companions in the army and air forces have done for the benefit of this country".
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Dan Bennett, the Wasilla police informant, he was accused of domestic violence and assault against the woman, and of family violence and arms being drugged.
18 pleas against the new asylum policy are supported by the United States and the Colombia Federation.
Eighteen states and the Colombian Federation apply for a change to the new line in force in the United States that does not grant asylum to people fleeing gang violence or family violence.
18 representatives of the state and the federal community have left a letter of friends of justice on Friday in Washington. The letter supports asylum seekers that break the line says NBC News.
The full name of the defendant has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions, which was raised by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal line in August.
He says his partner, "and his sons of his violent gang," assaulted him.
He was arrested in Texas.
The general prosecutor, who supported Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which most of the U.S. asylum seekers are from home to countries where gang violence and family violence have spread to all levels of society.
The new asylum policy of the United States repealed the decision of the Appeals Board of Appeal in 2014 that unpaid migrants could apply for asylum on the basis of family violence.
In his opinion on Friday, the General Prosecutor of the Colombian Federation commented that the new line "to ignore the state, federal and international laws for decades".
"The law of the Union requires that all asylum applications be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and that kind of obstacle infringes this principle", says the Friends of Justice.
Prosecutors also argue in a letter that the access of asylum seekers is prevented by practical damage to the US economy because the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "produce the necessary additional labour force".
In June, the General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered import judges to suspend the granting of asylum from victims of family violence and gang violence.
"Security is intended for persons fleeing from their country because of persecution or fear caused by a class of society or political opinion," Sessions announced in its opinion of 11.6.
The place of refuge was never meant to solve all the problems — even serious problems — that people face daily throughout the world.
The unwanted survivors will continue to survive in the Palo — the number of victims found has already doubled
The situation is becoming more serious to the survivors.
"Your business is very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma when you calm down your hot baby, please at the evacuation centre in the ruined city.
"The ambulances bring new bodies from a minute.
There's no clear water."
The residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered goods and try to save what still can be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and 7,5 hospitals that have been damaged in the radiation of the magnitude are full.
Some of the injured people, such as Dwi Haris, who suffer from fractures of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital, where patients are being treated for persistent, severe retardation.
His eyes are filled with tears when he repeated how a furious earthquake shaken the fifth floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
Harris says with Associated Press, and tells me that he was in his family as a wedding guest in the city.
"I heard my wife yelling at help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "provocation" with "propaganda declarations"
The U.S. Ambassador of China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after the Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the United States, which praises the mutual advantages of the US-China trade agreement.
The United States President Donald Trump referred to the annex paid to the China Daily magazine last Wednesday in the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper of the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interference with the Congress Halls held on 6.11.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempts to intervene in the US elections mean a new step in the Washington enlarged campaign to press China.
Although it is normal for the foreign government to disseminate the declarations to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war, where both parties are vuorovailing customs duties on counterparty export products.
According to Chinese and American experts, China's revenge tariffs were targeted at states at the beginning of the trade war, such as Iowa, who supported the Republic of Trump.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador of China and the long-term governor of Iowa states that Beijing has made damage to the US working population, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a large exporter of agricultural products to China.
China's "accelerating provocations by publishing propaganda statements in our own free press" wrote Branstad in his opinion paper published in the Des Moines Register of Sunday.
"The Chinese Government will benefit from the highly respected free word and press traditions by putting the paid declaration on the Des Moines Register", Branstad writes.
"In the paper cliffs of the pening streets, however, the different opinions appear only limited, and the real, divergent opinions that Chinese citizens can not see in the alarming development of their economy; this is because the media is strictly in the retreat of the Communist Party of China," he writes.
Branstad continues by saying that "one of the largest newspapers in China avoided the publication of the offer" by the article he wrote, but not by specifying what magazine it is.
Kavanaugh's fiasko expelled women from the Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the tops of the Republicans stand behind and defend Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court can cause a response, according to analyticals, especially in the forthcoming interim elections with female voters.
The emotions surrounding the case have taken a major turn, and most Republicans have already announced their desire to proceed in the vote.
"These things cannot be canceled," says Professor Grant Reeher Syracuse at the University of Maxwell institute of The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher does not believe that senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona)'s recent offer for the FBI investigation will make angry voters happy.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior advisor and the informant of the National Reform Group MoveOn on Friday, according to the newspaper in the capital city.
On Friday morning, demonstrators sang "coming to November" in the Senate corridors when deciding on the ruling Republicans of the Judicial Committee to proceed to Kavanaugh's appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic reports.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluated," says Stu Rothenberg, an unreliable political analyst in the interview on the news site.
"The people say that the enthusiasm has already been high, and that is true.
But it could be even greater, in particular, with women's uncertainties in the neighbourhood and the youngest voters aged 18-29, who often do not vote because they do not like the President."
The analysts anticipate a possible response if the Republicans progress with confirmation before Ford's proclamation against the Supreme Court candidate, in which he argued about sexual harassment.
"This is going to be a mix-up to the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, NBC News News at the beginning of the last week.
"This is not just about the vote or the final vote of the Committee or whether Kavanaugh is being questioned, but about how the Republicans have acted on the matter and how they have treated Ford", Guy Cecil, the head of the United States of America's Democratic Priorities Group, pointed out to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided by their belief in Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s statement of witness as the latter tends to be inclined.
According to the new survey of opinion by YouGov, 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35% say that they believe Kavanaugh.
38% also say that Kavanaugh is likely to or definitely lied in his statement of witnesses, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake moves forward, the FBI is investigating Ford and at least one of the other charges filed by Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
In front of the Judicial Committee, Ford convicted Kavanaugh that he was distressed in drinking ford when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court has revealed to him at the student festival of his family body while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor is planning to start a new Internet response to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a start-up company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source code of Berners-Lee on the Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data are stored and who has access to any information.
In the Fast Company interview, Berners-Lee jokes about Inrupt's purpose to control the world.
"This has to be done now," he said, referring to his start-up business.
"It's an historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal data stock", i.e. POD.
It may contain contact lists, memories, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available with one browser simultaneously.
In the personal data storage, it is unique that you are fully tied to the user who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "for personal entry into force through information".
According to the company CEO, John Bruce, the Inrupt idea is to give resources, processes and required skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently comprises a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some hired developers working with the project and a community composed of voluntary coding agents.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website. This is all available from this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not discussing with "Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a perfect change, where all their business models will be translated into their heads in one night".
"We're not asking their consent to this."
In the Medium article published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote Inrupt 'the task is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the coherence and quality of the new network built by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee arranged the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology University.
During recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains its position as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute, as well as after Inrupt started.
"I am extremely optimistic in the next era of the network" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the city remembers the hero priest of World War I
The city is celebrating the only priest who was awarded the Victoria Cross medal of the Church of England as a soldier after the events have been over 100 years.
The medal of courage was awarded to Colonel Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 due to the attacks of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt villages.
However, four days later, the Vann died of a sniper without ever knowing about the highest honor of the British army.
Two of his grandchildren were exposing a memorial stone at a parade in Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says that the event is "acting symbolic"; the monument was revealed just 100 years after his rewarded grandfather's excellence.
According to London Gazette, 29 9.1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very thick fog and under heavy field darts and machine rifles."
Later, he fell on his front line and "providing the greatest courage" led to the advancement of the troops before he roamed on his own to the field. In the following battle, Vann took his own hand down three gun patter soldiers.
Colonel Vann died of a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — only one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's act was "something that I could never achieve, something that arouses respect."
Michael Vann He and his brother, Dr. James Van, he, uh... he, uh... he, uh, he, uh, he, uh, he, uh... he, uh, he, uh, he, uh, he, uh, he, uh... he, uh... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he...
Michael Vann says it's a great honor to be part of the parade and added: "The great crowd is remembering the glory of the true hero."
Friends of a free fight waited all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – TV shows Pipsa Possua
Imagine the situation where you've been monitoring all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event is not presented.
The event in San Jose had 13 matches, of which six main series matches, and the show was intended to be a direct broadcast in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program changed to the big shock of the viewers of Pipsa Posso.
Some viewers were not really happy to watch over the whole night for the fight.
One of the friends of the free fight opened up on Twitter, describing the replacement of a match with children's drawings "some sick joke".
According to the law, this content was not appropriate to be presented at 6:00 in the morning, so they had to change it to the children's programme", explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior Deputy Director for Marketing and Communications.
"Pig Pig, yes."
The Bellator director, Scott Coker, said that the schedules will be working to enable British viewers to follow the events in the future.
"I'm thinking about the recommittee, where we'll probably get the program to work," Coker said.
"But it is 6:00 in the morning, and we will not have our time before Sunday, which is on Monday at their time.
We're working on this.
You can believe that when the program changed their heads, the messages began to go in the direction and to the other, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix a mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case, but it was a matter of law.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and we tried too much.
This is a sad situation."
Desert Island Discuss: Tom Daley feels understatement because of her sexuality.
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley tells us that he felt lower than anyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me that she only noticed when she came to high school, "Everything isn't like me."
Daley, who spoke about the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, told Lauren Laverne that he spoke about gay rights in order to give others ‘will’.
He also tells us how winning at the Olympics was no longer so important after having a child.
The permanent conductor of the long-term radio programme, Kristy Young, has taken several months of leave because of disease.
When Daley appeared as a guest in Laverne's first program, Daley said that she felt as a young ‘smaller’ than everyone else, 'cause it was not socially acceptable to keep boys and jobs'.
He says, "To this day, these emotions, to feel less and different have been reality, and they have given me strength and energy that I have needed to succeed."
He says that he wanted to show himself to be ‘something’ so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality would eventually be revealed.
Two-fold of the Olympic Pronsmitalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he is present in this year's National Community races to appeal to the criminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to live openly without sanctions, and he wanted to give “will” to other people.
The triple world champion tells his love for a man — the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — as a "surprising surprise".
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he says that the age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things when you were young," she attended her first Olympics at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later, "it's hard to find another similar age who would have experienced similar contemporaries and contradictions," Daley says.
The couple received a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – which has resulted in a change in Daley's "size perspective".
"If you'd asked me last year, my life would have been spinning around winning the gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than a golden Olympic Medal.
Robbie's my Olympic Kultamitalin."
His son was named according to Daley's father, who died in 2011 only when he was 40 years old.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the most recent things he asked Daley about the Olympics tickets in 2012, and he wanted to sit in the front seat.
"I couldn't tell him he's not gonna be there anymore to be in the front line," Daley says.
"I kept her hand when her breath stopped. Only after she had really stopped breathing and she was dead, I finally realized that she was not injured," she says.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew this was something I've been dreaming of all my life – jumping in front of the home world at the Olympics. There's no better feeling," Daley says.
This was also an enthusiasm in the shipment of his first song – Heather Small’s song "Proud" – that already aroused emotions when he was preparing for the Olympics, and who still gets his skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs sent to BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Half-sized for Mickelson's switch seat on Saturday Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing the 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to be very disappointed to avoid the recurrence of his history as an unhappy performance.
Mickelson, who plays the record 12 times every two years at the event, moved to the switch seat by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourball and foursome on Saturday.
In general, the American five-fold Major tournament winner at the center of the attention was now spending half a day as a cheerleader and on the other side to try to take over their beatings.
Mickelson, a 48-year-old, who was not even held at the top of his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field, where a long-growing bear is punished by inaccurate beats.
If the field itself does not have enough opposition to Mickelson, the nineth game of Sunday is against the well-known British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who plays together with the new Tommy Fleetwood, which aims to set up the pipe of all four winnings this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind when they come to 12 doubles, get a flying departure, Michelson's game can prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his trust in his player, but what else could he say in a situation?
"He fully understands the role he played today. He knocked me on the back, rutically, and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of confidence.
He is definitely one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined something else, but that's how this went, and that's how we ended up.
He wants to be in that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldon's record of more of the Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 profits, 20 losses and seven half, but Furyk says his presence will bring something unspecified.
"He's funny, sarcasm, smart, keeps people at the expense of joking, and he's a funny guy, everyone likes," he explains.
"Younger players must also have had fun with him this week.
He brings as much more into the team than just his bet in the game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows how long leadership can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows about the experience that Ryder Cup's gradual leadership before the last day's doubles can become a rude journey.
In 1997, the Danish player made his debut in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros led five points of lead to the Americans, but who survived the winner with the limestone just and just the size of his nose and won the most narrow margin141⁄2 to 31⁄2.
"That reminds us of how we led strongly in Valderrama, we led sharply in Brookline, where we were lost, but we won Valderrama, although scarcely," said Bjorn, after watching the 5-3 wins of the 2018 team, both on Friday and yesterday, on the 10-6 leaders of the Le Golf National field.
History will show both to me and to all other members of the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're gonna do everything right.
The game isn't over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and we only aim to do so.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who play on our side, but we are aware of what is opposite: the best players in the world."
I'm glad how his team's players have come out of a difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I will never lick before you drop in such a thing.
Tomorrow is a completely different thing.
Tomorrow, individual performances are a priority, and then there are different issues to be discussed.
It is wonderful to be on the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, then the player's capacity will be tested on the bottom.
This is a message that must be sent to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to do the best.
Now we have to give up a partner who can go to [only] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the counterparty Captain Jim Furyk will require his players to do better as individuals than they could as partners. Except for this, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the full translations of the last day in both directions; he was involved in the winning team in Brookline before he ended up a loser when the European team won "Medinah with a miracle".
"I remember every word of the devil," he answered the question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw of the team of 1999 handed his team to the final day's work.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medinah.
When it moves in one direction, it weighs a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have set up our composition according to it and put the boys on the field in the way we want them, as you know, we are going to make miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead a defense fight and he meets Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are in order to meet their European counterparts.
"I put the team's guys in this order because I think it's carrying the whole tournament", Bjorn commented on his choices of double games.
The new German warship will be delayed again
The latest fregat of the German fleet should have been introduced in 2014, the aim of the ship is to replace the outdated cold-war equipment, but not earlier than next year due to faulty systems and explosive costs, reports local media.
According to the “Rheinland-Pfalzin”, the first ferret class of the new Baden-Württemberg, which was spoken to Die Zeit, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying after delivery problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the old Bremen class fregates.
According to the available information, they are equipped with effective tyres, missile systems for the fight against aircraft and surface ships, and with decoupled technology such as radar reflectivity and technology to reduce the detection of infrared and acoustic signals.
The main features of the ship also include the longer service range – new fregats should be able to operate on the sea for up to two years without visiting the port.
Continuing delays, however, mean that warships representing the top of technology – which are said to be aimed at improving the influence of Germany in overseas areas – are already obsolete at the time of their entering into service, the Die Zeit magazine points out.
The bad luck F125 fregat ended in the titles last year when the German fleet officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy returns the ship after it was delivered.
For reasons of return, it is a little known, but the German media has spoken about the essential "software and equipment errors" that make the warship inappropriate to battle tasks.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the size of the Baden-Württemberg-class crew is about 120, which is only half of the senior Bremen class fregats crew.
In addition, it was found that the ship is considerably overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet’s potential to subsequent updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, its capacity of 7 000 tonnes, is believed to be twice the heavyer than the corresponding class ships used in the Second World War Germany.
In addition to faulty equipment, the entire project price gap is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to rise to the sum of EUR 3.1 billion when the original price was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the use of new fregats have emerged when the German maritime power has recently been warned to shrink.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Director of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's operational ships are running out.
According to the authorities, the problem has increased over time because old ships have been removed, but no new ships have been submitted.
He complained that no Baden-Württemberg-class fregats could be used by the fleet.
The Environment Organization is listening to the hidden lives of the bats
A new study in the area of Scotland is aimed at identifying how bats exploit the landscape when hunting for food.
The new study is hoped to bring new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future protection measures.
The study carried out by the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will monitor the paint and dwarf packs, as well as the earrings and water wings in the Inverewe Garden area of the plant garden in Wester Ross.
The study sets specific storage equipment into the main points of the region to monitor the operation of the bakery during the period.
The organisation’s employees and volunteers also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequencies of the votes and the types which are concerned will be ensured by the analysis of experts.
On the basis of the results, a life-cycle map and a report will be drawn up where the behaviour of the bats can be presented in the dimensional image of the region.
Rob Dewar, the organisation’s natural safety advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the living environment are most important for the rest, and how different species exploit them.
Knowledge helps in the design of habitat areas such as the creation of grasslands and the management of forest areas, taking into account bats and related species.
Scotland and all UK bat populations have decreased considerably over the last 100 years.
Construction and land building work threatens resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also constitute a risk, such as fly papers and certain chemicals used in construction materials and pet cat attacks.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, due to the hunting practices in the night, their ears are more useful in catching the catch than in the eyes.
The bats use advanced echoing techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is an organisation focusing on the protection of the rural environment, which maintains more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares across the country – and they take them seriously.
It has ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of rest areas, and in some cases animal rescue measures.
The organisation has even set up the first and only of Scotland for the protection of the sanctified protected area of the lands of the Threave map in Dumfries and Galloway. Eight of the ten shrimp oils in Scotland are met in the area.
According to the farmer David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave suits the bats very well," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees, and all of which we have a good habitat.
Our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us to understand better what bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of checking the buildings for resting before taking up rehabilitation, because the destruction of one resting place of rest can involuntally result in up to 400 female lepaces and son-in-child death and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and killing, disturbing or destroying their rest areas are prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official of the Defence Organization for Fighters, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denys rape charges while lawyers prep for a case against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has stamped the rape accusations against him as "lightened" and says people want to "remember themselves" by using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action in order to challenge the German Der Spiegel magazine.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping the American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel in Lasvegas in 2009.
He's allegedly paid the victim $375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel reports on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared in the Instagram broadcast to 142 million followers only hours after the submission of the claims. 33-year-old football player steeply opposed the charges and described them as "valeuutious".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, false news," the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player kept smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to challenge Mr Spiegel’s claims that they have called the Reuters News Office 'unacceptable report on the doubts of privacy protection'.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player demands compensation for "spiritual suffering in accordance with the seriousness of the offence, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged case was reported in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan reportedly met at the nightclub and moved to the player's room where he allegedly raped it anonymously, according to the papers submitted to the Nevada Clark County Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was 99% good, but whose "one percent" was disappointing.
According to the papers, Ronaldo has confirmed a couple who have had sex, but it was a mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photos of his injuries at the hospital, but later ended up in a conciliation solution because he was "above of the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that he was "the subject of public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now calls for annulment of the reconciliation procedure because he is still traumatic about the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault from Manchester United, and moved to the Italian mighty team Juvent with an agreement of $100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom would "repent forever" of the end of the car manufacture
Great Britain would "return forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after the brexet, said Greg Clark.
He added his view to the notification of the United Kingdom Department of Toyota to temporarily suspend production in a factory close to Derby in Burnaston if Britain leaves the EU without agreement.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of border delays will be seen as job losses if the brexine ends without agreement.
A factory in Burnaston, which manufactured Toyotan Auris and Avensis models, manufactured almost 150 000 cars last year, and 90% of them were taken to the rest of the European Union.
"My point is that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, the production of our factory will be interrupted," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Toyotan Burnaston unit.
Other car manufacturers in Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed the fears of departing from the European Union in the way cross-border trade will operate.
For example, BMW has announced to close its factory that manufactures Mini for a month when the brexet is implemented.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concern concerns the risks related to the supply chain in the event of an uncontracted brexet.
The Toyota production line is run by a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from Britain and the EU region, and cars are manufactured from the order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it may cause disturbances at the border, which could lead to delays and congestion from parts.
According to Toyota, the holding of the Derbyshire factory for more than 24 hours is impossible and the production would be interrupted.
Clark says that Theresa May's EU relations plan is "a precise calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need an agreement, we want the best possible agreement, which is not just a success in the current situation, but an opportunity that we need to take advantage of," says BBC Radio 4 in Today.
"Not just Toyota, but also other manufacturers' statements show that we must be able to continue the series of very well-functioning supply chains so far."
Toyota cannot tell us how long production would be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is an employee of the union at the factory, says concern among the growing members: "The jobs lost in my experience will never return.
The informant of the government says: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House reports
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can be "to be moved another week" around the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh due to the duty of debt, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervising the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, which, in turn, examines Russia's involvement in elections, the links of Trump's assistants to Russia and the possible activities of the President to prevent justice.
There have been rumors in Washington for months about Trump's intention to separate the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardise Mueller's investigation in neutrality.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported the possibility of Rosenstein's discussions to record secret discussions with Trump and the possibility of dismissaling the President on the basis of Amendment 25 of the United States Constitution.
Rosenstein has denyed the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting has been to say that Rosenstein was to resign from his office.
However, President Trump was then a visit to the United Nations in New York, so the day of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would not be "in the best interest" to erode Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because the time came along with the consultation of the Senate Legal Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's weekly study on the arguments against Kavanaugh, which continued to postpone the Senate plenary.
Trump's head of press Sarah Sanders was on the Fox News Sunday program.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, Sanders said: "The number of days for this has not been set. It could be next week, this week, it can still be postponed for a week because of everything else because of what is happening at the highest court at the present time.
But I always want to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disagree with this argument: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Newsanker Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders says that the cause of the scarcity of the press conferences is due to other reasons than to displeasure of the "humanness" of TV suppliers, but said, "I do not deny the fact that they are looking for attention."
But Sanders gave us the idea of increasing direct contacts between Trump and the press.
"The President holds more Question Times than any of the presidents before him," he says, and adds more evidence without quoting, "We've checked those numbers."
"The press conferences will continue to be organised," said Sanders, but "it is infinitely much better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We are often trying to do this, and you have seen that we have done so many times in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions when leaving the White House or participating in open events or press conferences with valued persons visiting.
The presentation alone at the press conference is rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown the reason for this when he appeared unstoppable and timely for the journalists who met in a strange manner.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to workers from EU countries in Scotland (NHS Scotland) in relation to the fears of brexet
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the workers of the Skotlanian health system from the EU to express their gratitude and hope for their stay in the country after the brexet.
Mr Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter when the UK's resignation from the EU is less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already prepared to cover the costs of applying for the 'installed status' of EU citizens working with specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, the divorce negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also enhanced preparations for any non-contractual difference.
I know all of you are insecure times.
That is why I would like to repeat now how much we appreciate the contribution of each of our employees to the citizenship without looking at them.
colleagues from and outside the EU produce valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie emergency surgery due to head injury
Tennessee State Tigers team supporter Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team was destroyed from 31 to 27 Vanderbilt to Commodors on Saturday, reports Tennessea reporter Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's chief coach Rod Reed told the journalists that the injury occurred just before the half time.
"He came to the sidelines and simply shrinked into it," says Reed.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before they put him on the pairs and took him aside for a more accurate assessment.
Tennessee State's editor told the supplier of the WSMV channel to Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was released from surgery in Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no information on the type/extendation of the offences is available at this stage" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injuries occurred.
Abercrombie is a second year student at Tennessee State University and plays the first time in the team from Illinois after moving.
He had five tacks on Saturday before he left the game, making a total of 18 bucks in this period.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher batch tax when they buy property in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher batch tax when they buy property in Britain. Additional money will be used to help homeless people according to new plans.
The purpose of this amendment is to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the batch tax relates to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to GBP 120 million per year — to help homeless
Theresa May will inform foreign buyers today of a higher level of stamp tax when they buy property in Britain. The extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper dwellings and paid attention to the tax of good-benefit people.
The increase in the batch tax is directed at people and businesses that do not pay taxes to Britain, and the extra money that comes from this will be directed to the government to facilitate the distress of the homeless.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp tax two years ago, in addition to the second housing and investment housing increases, may be up to three per cent.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to GBP 120 million per year.
Approximately 13% of London’s new buildings are purchased by permanent residents other than the United Kingdom, thereby increasing prices and making it difficult for the buyers to buy homes on the market for their own dwellings.
Many wealthy regions in Britain, especially in its capital, have become ‘awake cities’ because several foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line will come only weeks after Boris Johnson presented the lowering of the stamp tax as a means of facilitating the purchase of young people’s first housing.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping the prices of property high by buying and leaving it unbuild, and called on Prime Minister May to reject the quotas for affordable dwellings in order to correct the "ashamed situation" in Britain.
Corby has published a series of remarkable proposals for reform of the housing market, including the restrictions on the leases and the end of 'inconclusive decisions'.
He would also like to give more power to the delegations in matters relating to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says: "I said last year that I was going to hold my Prime Minister’s term for the restoration of the British dream — that every generation’s life should be better than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in Britain and companies abroad can buy apartments as easily as hard as the British residents.
Too many people have become too distant to have their homes, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish country team."
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says his "primary goal" is to be the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott has been inspiring to raise the north-east corner of the country's home team back on his feet.
Ross moved to the "light stadium" this summer after he had redirected St. Mirren back to the Scottish Chocolate in the last season.
"I wanted to play as a player in my country's team.
I got to the second team, and that's it," Ross says at the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"I often looked at my father and his Scottish games at Hampden, and that's something that has always pulled me back.
This kind of opportunity will only come up if I succeed as the manager of the company."
The predecessors of Ross as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about entering the boots of his nominal predecessors in a nominal company. He has previously rejected Barnsley and Iptswich Town's offers.
"At this moment, my success is measured by whether I can return this company to the valioliga.
Based on the structure and ability of the Society, it is undoubtedly part of the valioliga," he says.
"It's not easy to get in there, but I'd probably think I was successful only if I could create a team back to the elective gala."
Ross has been a manager only for three years: first as Dumbarton's Deputy Director and then for 15 months in the Heats Coach Group.
Then he helped Alloa rise from the third series of fall-off games and raised St. Mirren from the fall-off to champions during the next season.
Ross says that he feels better now than he ever did in the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably on the road trip with my career," he recalls the time when he moved to Alloa's leadership.
"I really believed I was better suited as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange, because I played well, earned a medium well, and I could enjoy some relatively great successes.
But it could be hard to play.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, such as stress and pressure from work, but running the team seems to be the right task.

The summer heat wave has kicked out the pubs that struggle with the UK’s difficulties, while at the same time increasing pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pubs and bar chains increased by 2.7% during July, but the output of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The figures compiled by Peter Martin’s CGA business consultant said: “Continuous solar weather and the long-term participation of England in the football World Championships meant that, from July, the sale of pubs was 2.8% higher, while the month was worse for restaurants.
The fall of June 1.8% in the sale of restaurants was only worse in July.
Bubbles and bars concentrated on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in sales of restaurants.
The bubbles concentrated on the food side also suffer from heat, but less dramaticly than the restaurants runners.
Looks like people just wanted out drinking in their minds.
The sales of bars and pubs operated by companies increased by 6.6% during the month, and the sales of food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman's RSM company providing services for leisure and hotel restaurants says: "Results continue the trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the largest factors affecting the sale of non-home food market.
It is no surprise that the fight against restaurant chains continues, although the decrease in sales of 4.8% per year is increasing, especially now that the sector is currently struggling with cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come to the operators focused on the sauce, and only time will show if the cinema's ferved temperatures would have brought the breath of the industry very much needed.
The total increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the creation of new brands.

Fifth of children secret social media accounts from their parents
Fifth of the children – some of them, even 11 years old – secretly account of social media from their parents and teachers, research reports
A study of 20,000 upper secondary school students revealed the existence of an increasing phenomenon of “Instagram feik tiles”
The news raised the concern that the accounts could share the content of sexually perplexed
20 percent of the student told me that he was holding a headpiece that was shown to parents
A fifth of the children, some of whom are even 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 upper secondary school students revealed a rapidly growing existence of ‘Instagram feik tiles’, referring to the Instagram site for the distribution of images.
The news has raised fears that accounts can publish sexually sensitive content.
20 percent of the student said that they would consider cleaning a ‘head account’ for parents to be shown while using other private accounts.
One mother found messages written by a teenager, hoping that he would be raped after a meeting with his 13 - year - old daughter on a secret site.
The study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Advisory Board of Rehtoris (HMC) revealed that 40% of the 11-18-year-old young people held two separate profiles and half of the respondents admitted to holding secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, says, "It's alarming that so many teenage people feel the attraction of setting up network spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle's athletes' voice to the government of Scotland's athletes
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-government member of the Scottish Athletes Board, who participates in the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most rewarded general athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, President of the Board, describes the name as a fine opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the extensive international experience gathered by the athlete during the last decade.
"Nolidhi is highly respected with athletes in Scotland, Great Britain and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from his appointment to the government," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I am eager to wait for my role as the sound of athletes, and I hope that I can be useful and help guide Scottish sport in the right direction."
Four Olympic cultures won by an American athlete, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Atlantic, and now acting as a regular commentator of BBC, lost his walking ability as a result of a transient blood circulation disorder in the brain.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say it's only time to show, toive, and fit.
This has been a exhausting job, but I've recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I'm already practicing kettle!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Mother-like cow advertising distributes opinions online
The mothers who are breast-producing chest pumps are like milk cows have shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, who produces consumer technology, has placed on the market a product called "the first silent and wearable breast pump of the world". Its marketing is accelerated by the language of the cheeky and musical video style ad, describing the freedom of the new pump to breast-feeding mothers.
Four mothers of real life dance in a hay-fulled nave, for example, in the words of the following song: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't see him," and "If you didn't notice, they weren't tears, they are tits."
The teller continues, "Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bread."
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company caused a discussion online.
77 000 viewers and hundreds of comments gathered have caused contradictory reactions in viewers. Many say it is a waste of the daily “horrors” of the milk industry.
"The use of the faculty in advertising of this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and be born so that they can produce milk, but their babies will be stolen from them soon after childbirth," writes a commentary.
Elvie breast pump is incredibly suitable in the lactating vest (Elvie/Mother)
Another viewer commented: "It is understandably traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why wouldn't they be used to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their baby?"
The third commentator added: "A full-time advertising."
I also got the defendants: a woman admitted that the advertisement was "shit".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of these if I were still breast-feeding.
It made me feel like a cow when I blew up.
It's a little crazy, but I took it like it is.
This is a brilliant product," reads one of the comments.
The second viewer commented: "This is a funny advertising that is directed to mothers who pump (usually at work or in toilets) and “sound themselves as cows”.
The purpose of this advertising is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, women of the video reveal that they've been dancing undetectable pumps on their brass.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using the breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, instead, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses, and it is incredibly suitable for breast-feeding sticks, which gives women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside during pumping.
Ana Balarin, the partner of the Mother Maintenance Office and the artistic director commented: "Elvie pump is a changing product that earned a bold and provocative entry on the market.
By breast-feeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump into the lightfield, we brought out the feeling of incredible freedom of the new pump in a entertaining and identifiable way."
The Elvie pump has ended up in the titles before.
In London, the two children’s mother appeared in Catwalk, a designer, Marta Jakubowski’s costume, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in all silence
In spite of the fact that the monthly number of cross border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, the number of retreats and policies introduced by Trump's regime have increased sharply.
Most subsidiaries are traditionally composed of unpaid migrants, and registration as a foster family may jeopardise their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential subsidiaries and other adults in the economy must give fingerprints and that this information is shared with the import authorities.
Matthew Albence, the High Level Immigration and Customs Authority, last week, witnessed that the Office had arrested tens of people who had applied for subsidiaries for minor immigrants.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no previous criminal records.
"The 80% of people who are either members of the family or members of their households are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we keep looking for these people," says Albence.
When attempting to deal with children’s cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that, in some cases, the case must be dealt with within a month of the time limit of 60 days prior to the arrest, tell the staff of the reception centre.
Many would rather be present through a video conference than personally in conducting their case at the Court of Justice on Immigrants' Affairs.
Those who are not regarded as legitimate for assistance shall be expelled immediately.
According to the reports published in the reception centres and in the last months of the system, the time spent in children's imprisonment affects whether children start suffering from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent explosions or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, concern is highlighted in particular in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of child’s despair can be ignored because of the large size of the facility.
They add that the transfer of children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children already suffer from traumas.
Syria commands the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately
During the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been in war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally in the country, using an excuse for the fight against terrorism, and that "they will act with them in accordance with it".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and afterwards, and where millions of people have been forced to escape their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue the "holy battle until all Syria has been cleaned" from both terrorist organisations and "incompetent foreign troops".
The United States has around 2,000 soldiers located in Syria, where they mainly train and guide Kurds and President Bashar al-Assad opposing Arab forces.
France has invested in fighting to tear down over 1,000 military departments.
On the refugee question, Moualem said that conditions were good for return and accused some Westerns of spreading "irrational fears" which encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
"We have invited the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these refunds," he said.
"They politized a thing that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid for reconstruction is not granted to Syria before the end of the war has been agreed by a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to the UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel base in Idlib has created a chance to conduct political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on the territory of the Syrian forces supported by Russia, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has "selected time limits" and expressed the wish for military action to be targeted by jihadists, including al-Qaida-related al-Nusra front fighters, "to be destroyed".
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of the new government and opposition committee to create a draft constitution of post-war Syria and to harmonise the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to "revising the provisions of the current Constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Trump will be selected for another period
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many viewers of Liberals are likely to wish, take office and scandal decide his premature term.
This would undoubtedly be the decision of the most dramatic presidency ever!
To date, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
After 2014, the figures of the best viewer have more than doubled to 1.05 million CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers compared to 1.7 million people in four years ago, and the MSNBC Rachel Maddow Show has reached the cable TV: top readings of 3.5 million viewers in major news reports.
"This is a feather that attracts people, because it is something we do not understand," says Neal Baer, the main producer of the ABC Designed Survivor programme, from the minister who will become president of the attack destroyed Congress building.
Nell Scovell, who has experienced a comedy writer and a book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, is another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked me why.
The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV programs, the news from Washington can determine how Roe vs. Wade goes, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other and how the world economy can.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes outside the obligations of the conscious citizen to look at a six-hour panel of experts denying the use of Bob Woodward's source data for Fear, Paul Manafort's 15 000 dollars of strutskin pilots (Washington Post said that "the excellence made a copy of clothing") and Stormy Daniels' President Trump's anatomy undecorated descriptions.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario again in the same way as I used to.
"What he does feels like a real TV program, because partly it's about giving the audience something every night," says the leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Panttilainamo series of Brent Montgomery Trump's show of changing people and the daily rotation of the plots (NFL dispute, Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't miss any episode, or you'll fall off the wheels.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a wonderful sunshine day on the northern coast of Kaua, but he couldn't go out because he watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not withdraw from the programme where Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs and was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Outside, money flows to a rigorous intermediate fight
It is not surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania has encountered a real cash flow, because, as a result of the reorganisation of the congressional circles, two already elected candidates are forced to fight for one place.
This recently resettled Pittsburg constituency is a battle challenge for democrats, Conor Lamb, who received its place from another constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is in competition with another elected candidate, Keith Rothfus of Republicans, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is duplicated with the new 17th constituency.
The regional division was reintroduced after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old constituent division favoured the Republicans against the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th constituency has launched economic struggle in the main parties' financial departments at the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became familiar with Pennsylvania after the special elections of the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania, which were widely followed.
The place had been on the Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won 20 percent in the region.
Political commentators have made a great way forward to the Democrats.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but retreated its intentions
The diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and the mild response to Washington.
President Trumpi had a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization Group's management team.
The officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to invite the American diplomatic directors back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of the "slowlines that Taiwan is no longer recognised", said Heather Nauert in his opinion earlier this month.
However, punishments were considered only for El Salvador, who received an estimated 140 million dollars of aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, as well as development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including economic assistance cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central America country with a high degree of unemployment and homicide.
In the course of the internal meetings, the North and Central America authorities postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity. The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent migrants from seeking to the United States.
In mid-September, however, the high administration officials made it clear that the meeting is being desired to progress, and that was an effective decision on the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give a sign to the mid-October meeting of some kind of emphasis on the administration's meeting, the diplomats said.
These three American ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in all silence without any new message or punishment from Washington.
The reporter of the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials, with two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues by anonymity.
Their report confirmed the external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke to the protection of anonymity condition.
History Teaching
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible prevention of President Trump's justice, which is now very impressive in public documents.
Mueller has also been informed of the investigation of whether Trump’s campaign operates secretly in cooperation with Russia when Russia was involved in the US elections.
If the power is changed in the Congress, President Trump will be able to notice that he is accountable to it just when he prepares to go back to his electorate, and he may be convicted of his peers.
There are a lot of scenarios here, and I don't mean that President Trump's loss would be inevitable - rather than the loss of those in Europe.
We need to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those solutions determine how long this struggle will be created.
In 1938 the German authorities would have been ready to depart from Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czech Republic in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the following years of bloodshed.
Historic moves to such turning points, where the unscrupulous advancement of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans now face a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump separates Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for the investigation of Mueller's case?
Rosenstein has been curtailed since the public became aware that he had proposed to record the secret President's speech and considered the possible inability of the President to handle his mission.
Rosenstein says The Times' report is wrong.
"How do we react if the recent FBI investigation of Brett Kavanugh's operation is not complete or fair, or if he is reaffirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the alleged alleged sexual harassment and dishonest witness statements?
And above all, are we voting in the interim elections for a Congress that holds President Trump responsible?
If we fail in these moments, our democracy will take a long and dark winter.
But I believe our success for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovakia, and she was expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic team.

Rangersin Graham Dorrans as optimistic for meeting Rapid Vienna
The Rangers meets at home on Thursday of Rapid Vienna, knowing that after a match against Villarreal in Spain in the same month, the victory of the Austrians would give the team a strong position to reach the G block of Europe's Liiga.
The knee injury prevented the middle field player Graham Dorrans from getting to the field this season before the Villarreal 2-2 game, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a pushboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good response," says the 31-year-old player.
"We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring a point with us.
Maybe we could have captured at the end of the victory, but all of it is probably a fair result.
They must have been better in the first half, and we got on the other side and we were better.
On Thursday, there is another important evening in the European Union.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game because their results were good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this group we will be able to give everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year, it was really tough for my own injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good, and the boys enjoy; the exercises are good.
I hope we can now make full effort, leave the season behind and succeed."
Fear of pension savings takes women to sleep
Although research participants had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, only few had spoken about it with their loved ones.
Approximately half of the participants in a global study told me that he would discuss the costs of long-term treatment with his spouse.
Only ten percent of the respondents told me that they spoke with their children.
"The people want the family to take care of them, but they don't take the point," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Company.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can't prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell you your wishes in time.
Talk to a professional person and your family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor in determining costs.
Take economic advice into the debate: advice can also help you to find a way to cover these costs.
Financial options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance or self-cost insurance for these costs, if you can afford it.
Prepare legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative in order to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider the drafting of the Charter for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine a trusted person to take care of economic decisions for you and to ensure that your invoices will be paid if you cannot take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to the hospital because of a health situation.

The victim's injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have been betting witnesses.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamies
At least 384 people have been killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the city in Indonesia on Friday, and according to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communication connections have been broken into the area, the rescue authorities have not received any information on the north of Donggala County, which is closer to the surface centre of the 7.5 magnitude radiation.
Over 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Key information about Palm and Donggala in Sulawes Island:
The request is the capital of the central Sulawes province, located at the west coast of the island of Sulawes, an estimated 379 800 inhabitants in 2017.
The earthquake and the tsunami hit the 40th anniversary of the city.
The municipality of Donggala extends more than 300 kilometres (180 kilometres) to the northwest coast line of the island of Sulawes.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative area under the province, whose population was estimated at 299 200 in 2017.
The main business of the central Sulawes province, and in particular the Donggala coastal region, is fisheries and agriculture.
It is also important to extract nickel, but it is focused on the opposite coast of Sulawes in Morowal.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, several tsunames have been hit by Palu and Donggala in the last 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit the West of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on its stand-alone Pacific Ring of Fire and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunames in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the West coast of Acehi Province of North Sumatra in Indonesia caused tsunami on December 26, attacking 14 countries and killing 226 000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Acehi region.

Federal prosecutors consider imposing a rare death penalty on suspected NYC terrorist attack
The federal prosecutors in New York seek a death penalty to Sayfullo Saipoville, suspected of eight human lives in New York City, which is a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state since the federal crime in 1953.
According to the accusation, Saipov, 30, used the Home Depot rental car in a logical attack on the West Side Highway bikeway in Manhattan, where he drove on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a declaration relating to the application for the death penalty of the southern regime of New York, the death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to demonstrate that Saipov killed 'reasonably' eight of their victims and caused 'reasonably' serious physical injuries.
According to the case-law, it is possible to sentence the death penalty on both charges.
Week after the attack, the federal law charged Saipoville with a 22-point charge, including eight murders to assist the terrorist organization. The federal prosecutors typically use this criminal code in cases of organised crime, including charges for violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "a remarkable design and preparation", the prosecutors said and described the way Saipov made his actions "a terrible, cruel and disgraceful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco's."
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For the past time, when the right of the southern regime in New York has been sentenced to death, it has been over a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but he was eventually sentenced to a lifetime imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in New York in the federal case in 1953, when a couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in conspiracy for the Soviet Union during a cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed at the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the legal documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show signs of repentance during the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators what he did was good, the police told them.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he had an enthusiasm after he watched ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to a 22-point prosecution to be innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defence attorneys representing Saipov, said the defence was "naturally disappointed" in the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose a death penalty and not a recognition and lifetime without a chance to be released is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by the parties to these events," said Patton.
Saipov’s defence had previously asked for no death penalty.
The Conservative MEP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today in a demonstration against the Conservatives to "mobilise the civilian army."
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of the representatives of Theresa May's own parliamentary representatives suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Mr Peter Bone, the Conservative line representative, said to the marshals in Birmingham, that the UK would "be already outside" if Farage were a brexit secretary.
But May meets the circles of his deeply divided lines in concluding the challenge underlined by the conservatives in favour of staying, associated with a separate demonstration against brexet in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his proposal for a Chequers compromise on the surface of the brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU pressure.
The supporters call on him to continue their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the recession, and to force the Eurosceptics and the Workers' Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said in the event of Leave Means Leave in Solihull, he wants to "screw the Chequers proposal to go."
He proposed that Farage be included and should be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd already be out," he said.
The MEP of Wellingborough added: "I defend Brexet, but we must get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not war against world wars to end up underground.
We want our own laws in our own country."
Bone cut off the idea that the public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British would have changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely misguided argument."
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative brexetist, also participated in the marshals and said to journalists: "I only say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, nor will it be supported by the members of the party or by activists who are really going to the streets and who are ultimately responsible for our success.
Drop the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Ministers can keep their work when they keep their promise."
Farage said that politicians need to feel pressure if they intend to make a decision on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we don't accept it."
When he spoke to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want that the politicians who are about to roll the brexet must feel pressure on you."
"We are going to mobilise the army of this country's citizens, which has given us victory in the brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is again an independent, self-government and proud state."
In the meantime, the supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before the two-hour occasion in the city centre.
A small group of activists swinged the "Tories Against Brexit" labels, the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the conservatives of the security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they are getting IT systems up and all the techniques for Canada plus plus, and the unbroken borders for the free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There's no good brex," he added.
Warren is seriously considering the presidential candidate.
The US Senator Elizabeth Warren says he's seriously considering the presidential candidate after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reported a masschusetz Democrat talking about his future at the city hall in Massachusetts, west on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticisms against President Trump, meets in November in the renovation of the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was the joint president of the Massachusetts campaign in Trump 2016.
Warren has been expected to prosecute Trumpia in the 2020 elections.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was with his 36th meeting of the city house voters after the beginning of Trump's season.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to be president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and it includes a woman at the highest place.
Arrest in the case of a shooting of LSU Sims
On Saturday, Louisianan Baton Rouge's police announced that they arrested a person suspected of the murdered Friday shooting by Wayde Sims of the LSU basketball team.
The Baton Rouge police reported the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at 11:00 a.m. at the ET information conference.
The police had published a video of the Friday shooting incident and asked for help in identifying the man that appeared there.
Sims, 20, was shot near the campus area of Southern University early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got shot at his head and died as a result of it," Commissioner Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the Sports Network 247.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted he was in the interrogation, held a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not arrest the Resistance and was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-century junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 in the game and 10 in the last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship of team arrangements offered to him victory from Sebastian Vetel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was obvious that Mercedes' team arrangements were an important role in the competition.
Bottas had a good departure and left Hamilton almost his own happiness in defending his place at the first two rounds, calling to Vetel for his teammate.
Vettel went to the shield first and left Hamilton to drive a crowd on the tail that should have been resolved.
Mercedes went on the toilet later and returned after Vetteli, but after a little contact and the Ferrari driver moved back from the internal line, Hamilton left to defend his investment after the movement of two thirds.
Max Verstappen, who spent his 21th anniversary, started from the backstage, and he was the seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition in the long run of tyre exchanges, aiming at a fast ending and a fourth place to take Kimi Räikkö.
He finally came to the toilet at the 44th round, but he couldn't increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds when he took the fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valter was doing great all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he passed me.
The team has made an exceptional career in achieving a double victory," said Hamilton.
Very poor body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that he did not leak into the public's letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he accused the Supreme Court of sexual harassment of Brett Kavanaugh.
During the occasion in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the proof of Ford before the Senate's Committee on Justice, but said that what was going on in the Senate was a sign of the human "scientious, dishonest and dishonestness".
"This one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for a few days, seeing anger, people who are angry, mean, gross and dishonest," the president said.
"When we see publications and bedded things and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you give this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you year the document - ‘Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bleed.'
Wait a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't bleed," he added the senator, snapping it.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing charges for Fordin Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's charges and I didn't leak his story," said Feinstein to the committee according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes."
But his ban was unsuitable for the President who commented on the occasion of Saturday: "I will say to you that was very bad for the body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst thing I've ever seen in the body language."
The President continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, charged by three women with sexual harassment and assumed that democrats would use charges for their own benefit.
"They have decided to get back into power by any means.
You will see that wickedness and cruelty, and they will not care who they hurt or who they must walk over to gain power and control," the Mediaite reports the President.

Micronesia crash: Air Niugin says one person is missing after the plane crashed into the lagoon
The representatives of the airline in the Pacific plane in Micronesia are now telling one person to be lost, although according to the previous announcement, all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from a safely sinking plane.
Air Niugin said it hasn't been able to find one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that he was trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident researchers.
The airline did not respond immediately to any further information on the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane had hit the water trying to land on Chuuk Airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed at the hospital on Saturday and everyone was stable.
The cause of the rude and the exact movement of the events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the take-off.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane drove over the runway.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, told me the plane landed very low.
"This is a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to bend in a sinking machine in a belt deep water for emergency exits.
He told the passenger staff that he panicked and screamed, and that he himself had a mild head injury.

An analyst presents a time line for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor was able to complete a retreat in which a man was accused of burning a mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The American Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett proved lessons as an expert witness in the field of information analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data recorded on the cell phone in gathering together a 29-year-old convicted Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim's Jessica Chambers movements during the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett told me that he had received a number of mobile phone locations that showed that Tellis was against his previous claims with Chambers the night he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis' cell phone was at Chambers at the same time as Tellis claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford proved he wasn't in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in the Sanford car that night, Sanford said that Tellis was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
Based on the information recorded on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett pointed out that at some point after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The final sessions of the Defense are planned to be started on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to proceed to the jury later on the same day.

A New York nurse challenges the parish court because of a racist text message
A New York nurse challenges the parish court from discriminatory separation after having accidentally received a text message from the mother of the child in which he complains that he is "the new one of the dark ones".
The couple denies being racists and resembles the challenge of "clergy."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed his worries when the new nurse Giselle Maurice came to work on his first day of work in 2016, and she learned that this was dark.
"EIIIIIIII, FREE," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
But then he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who troubled the mistake he made, had dismissed Maurice, announced that their previous departure passports had been received by his afro-American nanny had failed to do his job and had been waiting for the filippinians this time.
Maurice got paid for one of his days of work, and he was sent home with a cab.
Now Maurice challenges the parish court to get compensation for dismissal and wants 350 dollars per day for a period of six months, for which he was originally washed to live and work in the family, but without agreement.
"I want to show them that it cannot be done," he said to the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to racist claims, saying that the decision of Maurice's employment relationship was a reasoned solution because they could not trust him after he was insulted.
"My wife sent her something she wasn't supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told me at the Post interview.
"But would you leave your child to someone you've been unfriendly to, even if you're just accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Really?
Plasco paralleld the challenge of extortion and I said that his wife had received a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Do we start chasing another one in a situation like this?
It's not very comfortable," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple in the social media, expressing their behaviour and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers were afraid that the public would not identify the speaking bear.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, says of the letter: "It is difficult to live in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It's funny now that Paddington's great popularity is known."
In fact, his father, who had worked as a cameraman of BBC before he was committed to writing children's books about toys bear adventures, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication of the books seemed bitter because his father died in the previous year.
He described Paddington as a very important family member and said his father was silently proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn't at all a clever guy," says the daughter.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as a child's achievement to him; something you are proud of, even though it is not really your own creation.
I think he experienced Paddington's success in that way.
Even though it was his creation, he always honored Paddington to himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter was giggled after the plane landed at the Nizzan Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
"Nad called a little bit of a difference and told me the situation is really bad that he was not expected to survive," says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called and said my daughter's gonna die in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
Drugs to allow doctors to keep his heart running gradually disappeared from his body.
He was dead a little earlier, and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was going to stop.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation around me with families and other people.
I had to keep myself together."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who was sad about his daughter's loss, rose up on a plane among other passengers who didn't know anything about the trials he's been through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt immense compassion for Nadi.
That he needed my love and understanding now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Depressed women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending cards with encouraging messages and a phone number that can be supported.
Davis' son Tyler got depressed when he was 13 and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I wouldn't want anyone's parents to have to experience the feelings I know every day," he said.
Davis, who lives in Lydney, 45, says his son was a promising cook with an infectious refreshment.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile would illuminate the whole room."
But he quit his job before he died because he felt like "in the darkness."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother found his brother who had taken his life off.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of the consequences.
Davis created cards to tell people that there are people you can go talk to even if it was a friend.
Don't be silenced. You have to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years and he lost his partner after 15 years of co-working with Mark soon after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was downstairs or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"The day before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was right in the country on Christmas, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't take eye contact or anything like it."
He notes that Mark's death was a difficult trauma for them, but they still have to survive: "It will disperse the family.
It's gonna tear us apart.
But we just have to move on and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts his investigation.
"I thought that if we could really do what he hoped - in time and extent - we might have a little coherence," Flake said on Saturday, and added to the fear that the committee would "disperse" the dead ends caused by the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want FBI investigation?
It's about timing.
The interim elections are only five weeks away, 6 November, and if the success of the Republicans is weak as expected, their efforts to make the man they want to be elected to the highest right of the country become difficult.
George W. Bush has grabbed the phone and called the Senators to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met through him his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is drawn up?
The Senate, in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, so Vice-President Mike Pence could blow the game off and confirm his choice to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea traps falls during Kim
According to the South Korean Legislator, the number of people who were deported from North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un had taken over seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the Ministry of Convergence of South Korea and told me that in 1 127 last 2011 they took place in 2,706.
According to Park, the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the prices of human smugglers.
There is no public comment on Pyongyang.
Most of the North Korea tractors will eventually be offered the citizenship of South Korea.
From Soul, more than 30 000 North Koreans have become illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a strongly protected demilitarised zone between the Highs.
China treats smugglers as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and is mostly reintroducing them by force.
Even technically, the relations between North Korea and South Korea in the war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of countries met in Pyongyang, and the discussions focused on the negotiation of nuclear stocks.
This followed the historic meeting of June, where President Donald Trump and Kim Jong met in Singapore and agreed at a general level on an attempt towards the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States for being stuck in the positions of sanctions after the meeting.
"No trust in the United States is on a reliable basis, and under such circumstances, we will never begin unilaterally to dismantle our equipment as the first", Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Your Nancy Fear calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteerical" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court
The minority director, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysteer" and said it was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Your fear commented on a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if she had acted like that, she would be called "hysteeric," Pelosi said his own reaction to Kavanaugh's statement of witness before the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was very emotionally denying accusations of sexual harassment of Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in the power of his emotions, and sometimes he shouted and lost his voice when he told about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the democratic members of the committee without calling the accusations against him as "grotesk and planned persecution against a person" organised by the liberals who were angry with Hillary Clinton for the 2016 presidential election.
Your fears said that Kavanaugh's statement of witness shows that it is not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed that he is partial to the Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent in his statements and in a way that he attacked Clintons and Democrats," said Pelosi.
Your fear wondered when he was asked whether he would prosecute Kavanaugh if this was confirmed and if the Democrats were to get a majority in the representative room.
"So let's say that if he doesn't tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which he is currently working," Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working for the US Federal Tribunal.
Your fear added that as a democratic he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible provisions regarding the health reform or Roe v Wade, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative prosecutor.
During its confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not a good time for a hysterical and impartial person to be elected a member of justice, and we would expect to say that it is amazing," your Pelosi said.
Women need to survive everything.
It is a legitimate fire speech over months and years of rage, and it cannot be kept without crying.
"We'll cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
He continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that he also wept when he was angry, but that he had developed a way to say to his spoken partner in a situation where he got angry and started crying:"You think I am sad now because I cry.
I'm really angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was genius."
Tears will be justified as a route of rage, even though they are commonly misunderstanding fundamentally.
One of the most remarkable memories of my early job in a male office is when I cried out of rage and older woman - a cold-blooded supervisor that I had always feared - grabbed me from the neck and dragged me into the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and then they're happy, because they're upset with your mind."
Patricia Schroeder, congressman of Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
When Hart got caught in 1987 on a boat called Monkey Business, and got out of the race, Schroeder was very frustrated that there was no reason why he would not try to become president.
"It wasn't quite a very thoughtful decision," he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven potential, and the least they needed more than one more.
Someone called the situation ‘Snows and the seventh dwarf.’
Since the campaign time was long, he was behind the money collection and so he said he wouldn't go to the race unless he had a size of two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He was discovered that some of his supporters who gave him a thousand dollars to male candidates only gave him 250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he thought.
When he spoke and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he became in power of his feelings for his supporters of gratitude, the frustration of a system that made it so difficult to collect funds for the electorate or delegations, and the anger for the sexisms - that he could not speak.
Schroeder reminds me of the press's reactions.
"You could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone would be be beaten as a memorial.
"He cried."
How the US-China Trade War can benefit Beijing
The launch of the US-China Trade War was earring, and although the battle is all but over, the country intervention can benefit Beijing in the long term, the experts say.
The President of the United States Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by setting import taxes on the main export articles in China, in which the solar panels, steel and aluminium are read.
The most significant escalation took place this week due to new duties affecting imports of GBP 200 billion (150 billion), taxing effectively half of all products imported into the United States of China.
Beijing has responded every time in the same dimension, lastly by setting five to ten per cent of customs duties for American imported goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the United States with an eye - style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic volume in the world would be depleting for a moment.
In order to get back to Washington, we should give up on our own demands, but the public conquest for the United States would be too humiliating to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts point out that, if Beijing plays its card correctly, the US Trade War can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the dependence between countries.
"A small political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, can create conditions that start a economic crash in one of the countries and this is in fact a more dangerous opportunity than they have understood so far," says Abigail Grace, who has studied the research assistant Center for New American Security in the idea room.
According to the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the country is "prepared" for the return of refugees
Syria says that she is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country after the destructive war over seven years.
When speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country will be improved.
"You are now more stable and safer as a result of developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to correct the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal situation.
The conditions now allow refugees to return voluntarily to a country from which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic activities in their daily lives and livelihood.
According to the United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian Government would be grateful for the assistance of the reconstruction of the destroyed land.
He stressed, however, that the government would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries supporting the rebels.
The European team confirmed Ryder Cup's victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup winning at the end of the US team at 16.5 against 10.5 Le Golf National field outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times consecutively in Europe, which has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown on its own when its Danish Captain Thomas Bjørn team reached 1.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star player, Phil Mickelson, had trouble almost all the time on the tournament, and he hit his start-up in the water at the 16th track, giving Francesco Molinar a fight.
Italian Molinari shineed in all rounds and became one of the four players, which has resulted in 5-0-0 since the tournaments began in its current form in 1979.
The results of the American Jordan Spieth were 5 and 4 against the lowest punished player in the European team, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, who was punished as the world's top player, lost with the result of 2 and 1 Ian Poulter in England, who could now play the last Ryder Cupi.
Eight of Ryder Cup's golf veteranes, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the winning European of the tournament in all time, at a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have this victory.
It is about the team and I am glad that I could be of help," said Garcia moved after the victory of the European team.
He transfers the call to his countrymen, Jon Rahm, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2 and 1 in individual competitions.
"I know a tremendous pride after winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him," said Rahm, a 23-year-old.
Woods lost all four of his fights in France, and now he has a Ryder Cup show 13-21-3.
Outstanding statistics from one of the best players of all time, who have won 14 big wins and will be second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the routes all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was high throughout the tournament.
The U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said that his troops failed after the performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We pressed the European team in this morning's games.
We're in trouble.
Respect Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, working with our American PGA and Ryder Cup and we're moving forward.
These 12 guys are great, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I've got to lift the hat.
We met our winner."
