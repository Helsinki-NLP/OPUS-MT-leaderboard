Members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to find themselves at Muppet Show
Certain members of the National Assembly have abbreviated on the proposal to change their address to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, representative of the Wales Parliament).
The alarm attacked after it was raised, the name of the National Assembly (Assembly) should be the Wales Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
Now all of the various political backgrounds fear that the new title can make them ridiculous.
According to one of the working parties, the group is concerned that their new name will rhyme the words "Twp" and "Pwp".
For our readers in Wales, twp is one thing, and pwp is a coke.
According to one of the representatives of the Plaid Party, the whole group is "unhappy" and therefore propose alternatives.
One of the conservative representatives said that his group was "open" to change the name, but noted, however, that the MWP was just a jump to "Muppet".
It is worth noting here that the word "w" in the walese language is thrown like the "u" in Yorkshire in English, i.e. by MWP in "map".
The opinion of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up the draft law initiating the nominal change is: "The final decision of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the representatives, in relation to the titles for the appointment of the members of the National Assembly."
The 2017 Act regulating Wales's government has allowed it to change the name of the Wales National Assembly.
The Commission published in June the results of the public consultation which proposed the inclusion of the name of the Wales Parliament and which received broad support.
As regards the address of the Members, the Commission prefers the title of the Welsh Parliament Member (Member of the Wales Parliament) and the abbreviation of the WMP, but the public consultation was more supportive of the MWP option.
Members have another and more alternatives, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who must submit a legislative proposal on changes in names in the coming weeks.
The law on reforms will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including the discretion of representatives and the structures of the Commission.
Members may decide on their own titles when discussing the draft law.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the name of the country
Citizens will vote on Sundays on whether the name of the country will be changed to the "Feed-Macedon Republic".
The aim of the referendum is to put a point at the end of a millennium debate with neighbouring Greece, whose region is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long been saying that it is essentially a territorial demand with its northern neighbour's name and has repeatedly challenged its request for EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov himself objects to the referendum on name change, and so does not take part in it.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of names is simply a compromise to be made for their EU and NATO accession.
Harlem churches in a difficult situation, St. Martin's bells shut up.
“ More clearly, as I hear from older people, there was a bar and a church on every corner, ” says Adams.
- Not one of them anymore."
As you say, the disappearance of bars would even be understandable.
“ People now have a different way of dating, ” he says.
– Bars are no longer in the community day where people run out every day."
As far as churches are concerned, Adams fears that the sale of church property does not bring about the hopes of the leaders, “and in time they will keep again where they left. ”
And, adding to the place of churches, there will be resident buildings whose community also does not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The final majority of those buying an apartment in these buildings will be white, and this will continue to rush the final closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that most of those who move into these apartments would join the Faith."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black city — the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin in a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of the church in the thirty years,
After that, a nearby black congregation landed.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the reverend is known to run a boukot on the Harlem Buy Street, the 125th Street is using blacks or is unwilling to market black products against its business owners.
In 1939 a fire was caused by serious damage in the building, but during the renovation, the bell game was built to order the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son, and his successor in St. Martin's Paris, proudly referred to the bells of the poor.
In July, a bell game expert said that this bell game was a "a cultural heritage", a "an unreplaceable, historically important instrument".
The expert at the University of Michigani, Tiffany Ng, also noted that this was the first bell game in the world, which was spoken by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was involved in the bigger bells of Riverside church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin didn't sign up for anyone.
In St. Martin, in recent months, there was a complicated situation with the participation of buildings and entrepreneurs who were partly involved in the worldly leadership of the temple, partly by the Bishop's office.
In July, the head body of the Parókia, the Church Council, turned in writing to the Bishop’s Office, objecting to the Office’s ‘transfering costs’ to the Council, where the Council did not participate in the selection of buildings and entrepreneurs by the Office.
Certain members of the Faith complain to the lack of transparency of the Office's house.
Shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California during cancer fishing
According to official reports, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy during the crab fishing during the opening day of the cancer season, Saturday in California.
The attack took place before 7:00 a.m. at the Beacon's Beach coast at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel on the KSWB TV channel in San Diego told me that he and his friends were drowning in the Saturday morning about half an hour ago when he was aware that a boy cried for help.
Hammel first thought that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, “He bit!
He bit me!"
“ His keybone was ripped up, ” he said Hammel what he saw when he got to the boy.
– I started yelling to get everyone out of the water: ‘Capha in the water’,” she said.
The boy was transported with an air rescue to the San Diego Rady Child Hospital, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The species of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
As the rescue captain Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier, they've noticed sharks in the area, but then they found that it wasn't one of the species that were dangerous for humans.
Captain Giles also said that the boy suffered traumas on his upper body.
The authorities closed the coastal break between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the time and safety reasons of the investigation.
According to Giles, more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
The Sainsbury's would expand in the British Beauty Market
The Sainsbury's expert would take the contest with the Boots, the Superdrug and the Debenhams chains with sales and large-sized piperestants.
The decline in sales of fashion and household articles is also constantly increasing as part of the acquisition of £2.8 billion in the British beauty care market in the chain across the country of 11 stores and, if successful, they will appear in new stores.
Strengthening the pipeline is due to the attempt of shops in various ways to fill the shelf surfaces previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household articles.
The Sainsbury's said that it doubled its supply to 3000 products, including representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are now the first to offer.
But earlier brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be located in a larger area in brand-based stations like Boots and similar stores.
The store chain also reboots the Boutique makeup family, where most of the products are now vegan – they are now looking for more and more young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop has also tested its appearance in two of the Sainsbury's stores, one of which has been opened in Croydon last week, south of London, while the other year is open in Selly Oak in Burmingham.
By extending online purchases, as well as by redirecting food purchases to small local trades, large purchases should make greater efforts to disappoint customers.
According to the Director General of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more similar to the merchandise, as the chain is trying to introduce more services and other products other than food, to compete with discontent stores like Aldi and Lidl.
Since the two chains were purchased two years ago, the Sainsbury's hundreds of stores opened Argos classes and some Habitat classes – this step has also had a positive effect on food sales, thus the acquisition is even more profitable.
The chain failed the previous attempt to stapl the beauty and pharmaceutical classes.
At the beginning of the 2000s, Sainsbury's launched a joint venture with Boots, but the debate on the distribution of the revenues of the pharmaceutical classes in its stores ended this.
The new strategy was founded after three years ago, the Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmaceutical business to Celesió, who operates the Lloyds patic chain.
According to the store chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy, and in four shops it will offer a wider palette of luxury skin care products with brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, as the Trade Director of Sainsbury, said: “We would like to create a better environment for our customers by transforming our piperestors’ appearances.
We also recruited trained staff, who will help interested people with advice.
Our brand serves all needs, and the attractive environment and the conveniently approachable location provides a tempting power that increases your purchase experience to a new level."
Peter Jones was "destroyed" after Holly Willoughby abandoned the 11 million quid agreement.
The star of Dragons’ Den, Peter Jones, has left “destroyed” after Holly Willoughby's television broadcaster has withdrawn from the 11 million important agreements concerning the business of lifestyle products to concentrate on the new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's brand selling home clothes and accessories.
The two celebrity companies were compared to the Goop brand registered by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old show manager of this Morning announced his exit on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby thoroughly pulled out the match at the star of Dragons' Den, at Peter Jones, when their promising, lifestyle products were sold out at the last moment, focusing on his own extremely profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to certain sources, Jones was “destroyed” when the TV welcomed on Tuesday, at the headquarters of the Marlow of Jones’s business empire (Buckinghamshire), during a tense discussion, he reported that, because of all his new contracts worth £1.5 million, there was no longer enough time left to be dedicated to their common brand, which distributed household wears and accessories, Truly.
The two celebrity companies were compared to the Goop brand previously registered by Gwyneth Paltrow and expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets for 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he left Truly, Jones went from the island to one of his vacationers.
One source says: “Truly was far the most important thing for Holly.
He was going to deal with this in the long term, and that would give him the opportunity to live in the next few decades.
The fact that he got out was a full surprise for everyone.
She surprised everyone that happened on Tuesday, because the start was so close.
In Marlow's office, the warehouse is full of goods waiting for sale."
According to experts, the departure of one of the stars of this Morning, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, may cost the company a number of millions from the pillows and candles to the clothing and to the home garment, thanks to possible slippings.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-children showman and his husband, Dan Baldwin, worked out close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, ten years ago.
He started Truly with Willoughby Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples used to have a vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the M & S product deck and take over Ant McPartlin as the director of the ITV I'm Celebrity show.
Last night, a source close to Jones commented: “We do not want to comment on the business of [Jones].”
They sounded tough words, "We fell in love"
He was joking about the criticisms that the press would receive for the statement that some might think that he was “unprecedented ” and that he expressed so positively about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump let me do so much?
– asked Trump in a funny "study readers" voice.
- I didn't let any."
As noted, Kim would like to meet for the second time after the first trial in Singapore, Trump welcomed as a huge step towards North Korea's nuclear weaponry.
However, consultations on nuclear weapons are underway.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, Ri Jongho, who was representing North Korea, announced to the UN General Assembly that, as his country sees, the United States did not deliver a ‘compliant’ response to the early armed forces of North Korea.
Instead, as you say, the United States continues to maintain the pressure sanctions.
Trump was more optimistic in a campaign talk.
“ Things are going great with North Korea, ” she said.
– We were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have lost.
But now it's a really good relationship between us."
As he said, his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have shown positive results – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he was talking so unusual about his relationship with Kim.
“It is not difficult to behave first, but now there is no ten thousand people out there who would try to get in with a tow, just about two hundred of them are in front of me,” said Trump pointed to the group ahead.
In Indonesia, there are hundreds of dead tsunami and earthquake in the island
Indonesia also rejected the assistance of international aid organisations after the Lomboan earthquake.
Although more than 10% of Lombs' populations had to be installed, a disaster at national level has not been reported, which would be a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In a number of cases, they have said very clearly that there is no need for international assistance and that is why our situation is a little difficult,” Sumbung said.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working to set up an emergency team to be sent to Palu, but it is not yet sure that foreigners can actually participate in the on-the-spot rescues.
According to the speaker of the National Disaster Protection Agency, Sutopo, Indonesian agencies are currently assessing the request situation to see whether the involvement of international aid organisations is necessary.
Despite the continuing earthquake in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to face the devastating power of nature.
Although in the Aceh province, tsunami shelters were built, in other coastal areas it is not common at all.
There was a tsunami signal in force, the apparent lack of the tsunami signal system in Palu has also contributed to the development of a disaster requiring human life.
In the Indonesian islands, even in the best time, transport can be difficult.
Logistics is even more problematic during natural disasters.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombs is on its way to Palu, but at least three days before it reaches the affected zone.
President Joko Widodo placed the development of its collar infrastructure in Indonesia at the heart of his election campaign and did not save the cost of road and rail projects.
However, before the next year's elections, the Law Government now has budgetary deficits.
In addition, the President must face the ongoing tensions of the parties in Indonesia, since the majority of Muslims began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people had to die and tens of thousands had to be put out because of the disruptions in which Christian and Muslim bands fell together on the streets with booze cutters, bows, arrows, and other guns.

Chelsea led to 1 to 0 in the mid-term after the 25th minute of the Belgian star player Eden Hazard took the lead.

The 44-year-old woman's body was found in Grayson Mews at 7:55 a.m. on John Street, and a 32-year-old man, suspected of murder, was already in custody.
The police are asking the people in the neighborhood to report to anyone who saw anything or died.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “Inspector Brian O'Hagan, the investigation is still in the early stage, however, I ask everyone who was in Birkenhead near John Street, and he may have seen or heard something to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to find us anything that may have been recorded with the onboard camera, because he may have information that is relevant for the investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a birkenhead resident, and found her inside a property.
During the afternoon, her friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body came from in the morning hours.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are informing the victim's relatives for the time being.
One taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter the building until now, and no one could leave.

The statue of Parliament, Cromwell, is the newest victim of the fever of history and reconstruction.
The expulsion of the statue might be a poetic justice for destroying the cultural and church heritage of England with the enthusiasm of Cromwell and his fanatic puritan.
However, according to the Cromwell Society, Crick's suggestion is "funny", an attempt to rewrite history.
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: “It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell Zob before the Westminster Palace would eventually become a target table in the current discussions on the removal of statues.
During the English civil war, Cromwell did not order and execute the image destruction.
So maybe another Cromwell could be a victim for the actions of Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fascinating clamwell reflects the opinion of the 19th century, and he resembles a memory of historic shapes, which still needs to be celebrated according to many today."
In this connection, Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell may now be less than at the end of the 19th century, but still many of them consider Parliament to be a protector against external pressure, which, of course, was a monarchia in his case.
The fact that this picture is really accurate remains the subject of a story debate.
However, it is so certain that this conflict in the middle of the 16th century had an effect on the development of the further fate of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one of the sides of this conflict.
And it is worth celebrating and remembering the results achieved as a Lordprotector."
A murdered pig wounded to death by a Chinese farmer
According to the local press, a pig attacked and killed a farmer on a market in the southwest of China.
The man identified as Yuan only was found with blood on the market of the town of Liupanshu of Kujcsou, with a built-in beaten, reported the case on Sunday of the South China Morning Post.

Although it does not often occur, there have been reports of a case of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their massachusettsi farm and caused life-threatening injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pounded pig in Wales squeezed a farmer to the tractor until the man’s wife failed to alarm him.
In 2012, after an oreganian farmer was falsified by his own pigs, a manitoba farmer said in the CBC News that the pigs are not usually inclined to attack, but the blood taste may become aggressive.
"Great players.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt me.
All you have to do is give them respect," he said.

More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
In total, over 20 million audiences on six television channels followed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who applied for the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of rape in the eighteenth century.
Meanwhile, the political patt situation has not resolved, and the broadcasters had to break the normal programme for the last Friday swing: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake managed to make the FBI get a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that he was 100% sure Kavanaugh caught up at a high school party and tried to take him off.
In his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said that 100 percent of his confidence that this didn't happen.
The confessions reported by Nielsen were probably seen by more than 20.4 million audiences on Friday.
Nielsen was calculated with the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Networks, of the hearing were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen is difficult to measure the number of people watching the programs at their workplace.
For the sake of comparison, so many viewers are used to being the soccer winners or the Oscar award donor.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, who promoted Kavanaugh's appointments from all channels, was the highest, on average 5.69 million audiences during the whole day hearing.
Second place, ABC is with 3,26 million audiences.
CBS was 3,1, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89 and CNN 2,52 million, according to Nielsen's report.

After the mild Republican Senator's office issued the statement that Senator Kavanaugh was next to the vox, Friday morning, the CNN and CBS show appeared as the loud mass of protesters receives as they were attempting at the meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs in lift.
It was a few minutes of eyebrow while the mass was stretched and CNN was transmitting the scene in live transmission.
“I stand here before you, ” said a woman to the senator.
– Do you really think Kavanaugh's telling the truth before the public of the country?"
Others shouted: “You have the power to do what you do not for so many women. ”
Flake only said that his office had issued a statement and then added before the elevator door was closed that he would share what he had to say at the hearing of the Commission.
The cable and broadcasting channels were seen alive hours later, as the Committee votes on whether Kavanaugh's candidate was voted before the full Senate.
However, Flake said that he was willing to do so only if the FBI investigates the charges against the candidate next week, as the democrats in the minority have called for.
Flake's talks with her friend, Chris Coons, were convinced of the need to do this.
Flake decided after discussions with Coons and other senators later.
Flake's decision was correctly powered, since it was clear that without the investigation the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's mark.
President Trump started an FBI investigation on Kavanaugh's charges.

According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people suffered injuries last year when the police tried to stop the vote in the voting positions with aggressive collisions.
The independence teams were on the street all Friday night to prevent demonstrations supporting national police.
Although it was not possible to prevent it, the demonstration was eventually not on the normal route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, who participates in the separatist protests with his wife, says that there is no chance of Catalónia gaining independence.
“It was one of the best times of our life.
I saw my parents make tears of joy for what we can vote for, but by now our case has fallen off," he said.
Although the regional elections in December last year succeeded in an important one, even if a narrow victory is achieved, it is difficult for the Catalan Democrats to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their most well-known leaders have been forced to take voluntarily or are waiting for the court to bring a judgment on their role in organising the referendum and in the post-voting of independence.
According to Joan Puig, 42-year-old carmechanics with the police's support demonstration, the conflict was fired on both sides.
"The situation is more tense", he says.
One of the Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been waiting for the negotiations since last year, announced that the European Parliament elections will take place next Saturday.
“I can mostly reject the devalvation of democratic values and the repression represented by the Spanish Government if I participate as a candidate in European elections,” he said.
Londonderry: The police arrested three men who drove into a house with their cars.
The police arrested a 33, 34, and a 39-year-old man who drove several times to a house in Londonderry.
The case was in British summer time around 7:30 at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings says the gate and the building were injured.
They may have even shot the car with a number line at a moment.
With Menga's goal, Livingston beats the Rangers team to 1 to 0
Dolly Menga secured Livingston's victory with his first goal.
Livingston, fresh in the first class, has caused a big surprise for the Rangers team by bringing Steven Gerrard into his second defeat, who has been working as a coach of the Ibrox club since 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference, because Gary Holt's team was killed in the second place with the Hibernian team.
Therefore, Gerrards remained unwinded in the current season of Scot liga and faced the first team of Hearts in the first place next Sunday, with eight points left behind.
Before that, however, there is still a match to Rangers against Rapid Vienna in Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston's six wins have increased the show of division invincence, which means that Holt, Kenny Miller, who resigned last month, hasn't yet gotten out with the team.
Livingston has missed many situations against the unprecedented guest team
Holt's team could've gotten the lead in front of the only goal in the game, because their attack games have caused little trouble to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense of the opponent, but he overreacted the attack, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt was widely proved after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's ball crossed in front of the goal line.
The home team let the Rangers play their own game because they were sure they could disturb the guests in fixed games.
The goal of fate was born from a situation like this.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a hole in his defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of this from the middle of the sixteen.
At this stage of the game, Rangers was driving in ball possession, but domestic protection continued to be unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's gates were hardly threatened.
This trend continued in the second half of the game, except for one situation when Kelly had to protect Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempts on the Rangers Gate, Allan McGregor's foot, and Lithgow lost the gate from another free kicking Livingston.
The cross-sectional balls arrived on the 16th of Livingstone, but the defendants were thrown away every time. Two criminals were not received by the attacking team: one Halkett's entrance to Glenn Middleton as the exchange player and the other for the guarantee.
"Fenomenal" game from Livingston – game analysis
Tony Macaroni is from Aréna, Alasdair Lamont, correspondent to BBC Scotland
Livingston provided phenomenon performance and leased the prizes.
Players appeared excellently, and overlooking the expectations.
The members of the team and their game style have barely changed since they returned to the edge, but Holt's efforts also deserve a great deal of recognition, since the coach's arrived, he's been making the team very high.
Many players have brought the most excellent forms.
The commander of the team has made a great deal of protection, and Menga has properly incinerated Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers played without ideas.
As well as they are at times well represented under the leadership of Gerrard, they were now unable to bring that level.
The last shot has always been missing from the formula – by the way only once, they have failed domestic protection – so Rangers should quickly be able to get together because they were back in the middle of the field.
Former meeting in Köln
It was a pleasant mood and a good mood to describe the morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (29 September) in Berlin.
This was the last day of the visit to Erdo
The relationship between the two countries has worsened due to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership.
He then traveled to Köln, a newly built, giant mosque opening celebration.
The city of Köln gives home to the largest community of Turks living outside Turkey.
On grounds of security, the police banned the gathering of 25 000 people before the mosque, but many of the president's supporters appeared to see the Turkish Head of State.
In addition, hundreds of protesters against Erdo
The two contradictory protests are a fine example of the dividing position of the President's policy, celebrated by some Turkish German citizens as a hero, while others see autocrats in it.

Rosa hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (but the situation of the droughts may improve)
Arizona is rarely reached by tropical depression, but it is expected that this is what the state should count at the beginning of the next week when the remaining hurricane crossed to Rosa surpasses the wilderness in the southwest region, increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flood preparations for Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to the southern and eastern part of Nevada, as well as south-eastern areas of California and Utah; the preparation also covers the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The hurricane Rosa is expected to travel straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring great rains with him.
The phoenix meteorological service published the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950, ten tropical Cyclones have reached within the 200 - mile district of Phonenix in the form of tropical storm or depression!
For example, the hurricane Katrina (1967) approached the border of AZ forty miles."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre provide 50 to 100 mm precipitation, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the southwest desert areas (Central areas of the Arctic Mountains, the Great Basin, etc.), it can be counted as a precipitation of between 25 and 50 mm, but it may fall within 100 mm in each area.
The rain produced by Rosa may bring relief to areas not threatened with villains, as the area is currently severely dry.
Despite the serious danger of flooding, some rainings can have a charity effect on the southwest lands of the awolf.
“American drought Observation Service says that more than 40% of Arizona’s territory is affected by the minimum extreme dryness, which is considered to be the second most dangerous category,” says Weather.com.
Rosa's hurricane will first be on the coast of the Mexican Also-California peninsula.
It will remain hurricane and bring 137 km/h on Sunday morning, moving about 600 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and reaching a speed of approximately 19 km/h north.
The storm meets colder currents in the Pacific and will lose its power.
Thus, the coasts of Mexico are expected to reach it again as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening hours.
In some areas of Mexico, raining is expected, which significantly increases the possibility of flooding.
“The rainings can mean 70–150 mm of precipitation from Also-Califonia to the northwest of Sonora, where there may be 250 mm of precipitation” is reported in the weather.com report.
Rosa then proceeds as a tropical storm to the north of Mexico before reaching Arizona’s border in Tuesday, early dawn hours, by now in the form of tropical depression, so that Arizonan would be swept through to the southern Utah by Tuesday night.
“The greatest threat posed by Rosa and its remains in Also-California, Northwest Sonor and the extraordinary raining expected in the southwest desert areas of the United States will be”, said the National Hurricane Centre.
Rainfalls are expected to lead to life-threatening floods and traffic in the desert areas and to keep them from landscapes in mountain areas.

"Whoever votes for Judge Kavanaugh, the Democrat Party votes against the merciless and disgusting tactics", Trump said at the meeting in the town of Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh's candidate had to “bereave his madness and anger”.

Hundreds of people died in a runaway caused by an Indonesian earthquake, the number of the dead is rising
Many people have suffered the price, and at least 384 people have lost their lives when the huge waves reached the coast. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and escaper in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, announced on Saturday by the local authorities.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on Friday, when the high waves of nearly six feet (18 feet) reached the beach, many were drowned, and destroyed everything that came into their way.
The fountain was triggered by an earthquake of 7.5 strength.
“When the escaper observation was said yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach did not escape, so the waves became a victim,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB) at the Jakarai press conference.
“The escape price came not only in itself, cars, tails, houses, and all the other things from the beach,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was traveling at a speed of 800 km/h on the open sea before reaching the coast.
Some who climbed from the price to the top of the trees, and were saved, said.
About 16,700 people evacuated 24 shelters, please.
In the air recordings published by the Agency, there are many destroyed buildings and business locations, more twisted and collapsed bridges as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further extinctions.
The earthquakes could be perceived in a area of about 2.4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT), in the course of the earthquake in Friday, some 200 times more energy has been released than the atomic bomb dropped to Hirosima in World War II.
The Agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that the geographic conditions resulting from it could reinforce the effect of the escape bark.
Nugroho said the damage was “significant”, thousands of houses were destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were collapsed.
More victims were found among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, said, and then added that the number of victims has been 540, and that they are looking for 29 more.
Nugroho stated that the number and damage caused by the damage in the area called Donggala could be even greater in the coastal area of 300 km (190 km) from Palu, as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication is "fullly paralyzed, can't get information" about Donggala, said Nugroho.
“There are more than 300 000 people there”, says the Red Cross Communication, which also announced that the organization’s specialists and volunteers are on their way to the area affected by the disaster.
"The situation is already tragic, but it can be even worse", they said.
The Agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday about the lack of information to the population about the runaway of Palut, but according to the management, the waves have already reached the coast when the alert was released.
One of the amateur footages shared on the social sides is seen by a man trying to warn the people of the street with desperate screams from the top floor of a building.
In a few minutes, a vast waterwall strikes the beach, driving cars and buildings.
The Reuters news agency hasn't been able to prove the credibility of the footage.
The earthquake and the runaway price have caused electricity shortages, making it impossible to communicate around Palu, so that the authorities can also find it harder to coordinate rescue work.
The military shipping aid from Jakarta and other cities with freight aeroplanes, but according to the authorities, the evacuated population will continue to need food and other essential needs articles.
The airport of the city was opened only to facilitate aid work and is closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the Please set-up evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims in Indonesia is more than 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team saferly arrived from Donggala to the city of Palu, where the employees found shelter under the tent bunnies set up at the office's courtyard, but during their journey they met the trails of terrible destruction, he declared Doseba.
“ They said they saw a lot of houses that were ruined, ” he added.
- It's really bad."
While aid teams had access to the preparation of disaster response work, some complained that foreign professionals with great experience in this area could not travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, all overseas support, aid delivery and staff may be released into the territory of the country only if the location of the accident is declared an area of disaster at national level.
This hasn't happened until now.
“The case continues to be treated as a catastrophe at the level of the county,” said Aulia Arriani, one of the speakers of the Indonesian Red Cross.
– As the government recognises that it is indeed a disaster at national level, we can allow international aid services to be allowed, but so far no notification has been made."
On the second night after Friday's treason and escape, please, your missing friends and family members were still hoping that their loved ones would also be among those who have some light smuggled into the dark mood of reports about natural disasters.
On Saturday, during the rescue work, a little boy was pulled out of the channel.
On Sunday, workers managed to unleash a woman who was two days next to the body of her mother who was under ruins.

“I have a great spiritual burden as a garbage umbrella on Veterans,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when the news of Roa Roa Hotel’s collapse began to spread between umbrella umbrellas, he desperately tried to reach WhatsApp for hours to meet the competitors who attended the beach festival please.
However, in addition to the messages, only one gray beans appeared instead of two blue beans.

Kanye West: Rapper's name changed to Ya
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye from now on.
On Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the following message: “The creature formerly called Kanye West.”
For some time, the 41 - year - old West was called Ye's nickname, and the eighth album published in June was called this.
He announced the change of name before Saturday Night Live, where he will be expected to present a new Yandhi album.
In the show, Ariana Grande takes over the place, who renounced the role, referring to "sensitive reasons", said the producer of the show.
The new name is not just abbreviation of the current artist name of the rapper – according to its previous statements, West has a religious significance.
“I know that the word “Ye” is the most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you”, West mentioned earlier when he spoke to the radio director of Big Boy’s album.
- So I'm you and I are one and we're all one.
Kanye means that it's the only one, and it's the only one who's got the good in us, the bad, the confusion, symbolizes everything.
The album instead reflects who we really are."
Ye is one of the famous rappers who have a special interest in changing their names.
For example, Sean Combs has been running in the name of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he has announced that he now prefers the names of Love and Brother Love.
The former composer of West, JAY-Z, also varied several times by the fact that his name should be written together, with a link, or a large letter.
The Mexican President promised not to take the army against civilians.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican President, made a promise that he would never take the force against civilians in the near 50th anniversary of student sentences to the blood bath.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco space that “she would never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, military teams opened fire on the ground to participants in a peaceful demonstration, causing about 300 deaths, when left student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young people in Mexico – he grants a monthly financial contribution to students and plans to set up more free state universities.
He argued that the lack of unemployment and education are the two main factors that lead young people to the arms of criminal organisations.
The US should double the financing framework for MI solutions
As China becomes increasingly active in research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its support for such research, announced by Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and employee of solutions using artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple earlier.
He said this after the United States Government made notifications about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the US does not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, China also announced its related plans: the country's goal is to become the world's first number MI developer by 2030.
“Bulling the cost framework for MI research would be a good start, since all other countries are substantially missed compared to the US, and the next breakthrough in the MI area is at the threshold,” said Lee.
By duplicating research aid, the possibility could also increase twice that the United States could take the following major steps in the field of artificial intelligence was announced in the interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month in the management of Houghton Mifflin Warcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures.
In the 1980s, the University of Carnegie Mellon was working on a MI system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player and later acted as a member of Microsoft Research and the chairman of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of the technology competitions previously published by the US Government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and he was interested in the time when the next event would be organised, because at this time it would be possible to explore new future shapers.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to obtain the state aid needed for their research, said Lee.
"China does not acidify the scientific leaders, but the large companies," he added.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have also signed a wide range of college skulls to work in the field of MI.
Lee believes that by changing immigration policy, the US's efforts in the field of artificial intelligence could be greatly helped.
“I think that you should automatically receive a green card to those who have a doctoral degree in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Government announced its plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The National Science Fund of China provides support to the staff of academic institutions in the same way as the American National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organisations share money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, explained by Lee.
This year, the Ministry of Defence set up the MI centre of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where various industrial professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence crossed by the Select Committee.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an AI Next initiative,
The NSF currently spends $100 million a year in support of the MI research.
Meanwhile, the law of the United States of America, which has designed the establishment of a National Security MI committee, has not taken further steps in the interests of the matter for months.
In Macedonia, a referendum on changing the name of the country is held.
The population of Macedonia voted in the Sunday referendum on whether to change the country's name to the "Fear-Macedon Republic". By this step, they would resolve a disagreement with Greece for decades, which prevented the adoption of the country's request for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, whose territory is called Macedonia, argued that its North Neighbourhood is indicating that it is demanding a similar Greek area, and that is why it has so far deprived NATO and EU membership of the country.
In June, the two governments concluded an agreement on the new name of the state, but according to national counterparts, the ethnic identity of Macedonia is mostly undermined by the change of name.
President Ivanov stated that he would not take part in the referendum and that, as a result of the initiated bojkott campaign, it was doubtful whether the 50% participation rate required for the current referendum was found.
The issue on the vote lists is as follows: "Does the country support NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?".
The supporters of the nominal change, with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price should be paid in order to make it possible for Macedonia, one of the countries raised by the Roma of Yugoslavia, to be a member of the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, a sufficient Member has declared that it feels obligatory to the outcome of the vote itself.
The change of names requires two-thirds of the Parliament.
According to the State Election Committee, no notification of irregularities was received until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate reached only 16% until this point. This value was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which finally participated 66% of the voters registered).
“I came to vote for my children because we have a place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in the capital of Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, were elected in Strumica at the referendum of 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage before the Parliament's building in Skopj, as well as chairs and tents for the referendum to the boils.
“We also support NATO and EU membership of the country, but we would like to join with pride and upwards and not through the court door,” said Kavadarkov.
– We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If you don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can also turn to China or Russia as part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership could be counted with investments in Macedonia that a country with more than 20% of unemployment needs very much.
“I think that the majority will support our case because more than 80% of the population in the country is fundamentally supporting EU and NATO membership,” said Zaev, following the vote.
He added that the "yes" vote means "gaining the future of the country".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia, 30-43% of the voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
According to another survey made by Macedón Telma TV, the participation rate of 57% is expected on Sunday.
For those who want to vote, 70% said they'd say yes.
In order to make the referendum valid, the participation rate should be more than 50% by at least one vote.
The invalidity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the West Bank government, which was powered in May last year.

Scherzer wants to make Rockies harder.
Since the Nationals team missed access to the after season, they had no reason to make a real effort.
Scherzer, always competing spirit, can't wait to be on a Sunday track against Colorado Rockies, but only if the opponent team still has a chance to play this game. Rockies are a game of advantage in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Baseball League.

Trump campaigns in Western Virginia
The President also referred to the situation of the Supreme Judge, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“In November everything we have done is at stake.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones – I'm not going personally, but I'm leaving, so I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates", he said.
Trump continued: “Everybody can see what these terrible, radical democrat groups are doing with their own eyes.
They really made up their minds, and they are able to use any means to recover power, to see maliciousness and disgust.
It doesn't matter whoever is harmed, who is touched to have control in their hands, to have power; that is what they want, to control, and to power, but we will not leave ourselves."
According to the President, the democrats put in place the "resistance and obstacles".
"They have seen this in the last four days," he said, "as angry and malicious and liar," calling the Democrats.

No, uh, no, wait – all this with a very bad word of body, it was the worst word of body I've ever seen."
The Work Party will no longer support diversity.
It's not tolerating those who are free to say what they think.
I wasn't surprised when the activists of Momentum in my own party decided to be censored.
Finally, I am only the last in the long line of working parties who were told that they were not welcome, just because we said what we thought.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way, for being indifferent against antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship didn't like me to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which, in an ironic way, is just the issues where Jeremy also disagreed with the former leaders.
At the invitation to the Working Party meeting held in Nottingham East on Friday, they said they wanted a “indicative and productive meeting. ”
In most of my eight years as local representative of the Labour Party, these Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
But today, unfortunately, the voice has changed, and the promise of the “restrained, more polite” policy has been forgotten if it has ever been achieved at all.
It is increasingly evident that the Working Party is not tolerated and that all opinions are judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This trend began not long after Jeremy became the leader of a couple. My colleagues, I thought, like our political attitude, have recently been waiting for me to turn back on my individual opinion and to take a position on things that I would never agree with, be it national security issues or the single European market.
After all my public talks, regardless of what I have actually said, they start to squeeze on the social sides, demand my redemption, criticise the central policy and inform me that I should not be a member of the Work Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more lucky than many of my colleagues, because the contributions to me are usually struggling to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who have to face sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but they don't run.
The most disappointing aspect of our day's policy is that such a level of attacks have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Work Party has to support the tolerance culture.
However, the reality is that we have renounced diversity and that the circle of the party is becoming narrowed by all the 'insecurity' initiatives and any amendments to the election rules.
Over the last few years, many have advised me to hold back, not to be so pronounced, and then “all will be fine”.
But that's not why I took the political course.
32 years ago, I joined the Work Party as a student, because the Thatcher government has so neglected schools that our classroom has almost collapsed and then fought for better public service as a local councilman and Minister of Government for the most need.
I've never hidden my political views underneath, and I haven't done anything else in the last election.
Nottingham East was perfectly clear for everyone, what political positions I represent, and in which I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country is heading towards a Brexit that is not only about to hurt families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why so much time and energy is needed to question my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not to the members of Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, irrespective of whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of redemption or political purposes will prevent me from acting in accordance with my own judgments and in view of everyone's interests.
Chris Leslie, Nottingham East representative
Ayr–Melrose 38–17: Ayr is invincible to the top
Two late attempts have changed somewhat at the same endpoint, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved victory at the most entertaining game of the day, Tennent's Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the tabella, the only unbeatable of the ten teams.
Thanks to their unparalleled protection and the use of their superior situation, they won, so the domestics and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to meet a challenge in our fights so far, but we are still unbeatable, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, the player of Melrose, said: “We need to know that Ayr has used her situations much better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's experiment in 14 minutes, from which Frazier Climo scored the Ayr advantage, but thanks to the yellow card to Captain Rory Hughes, who was borrowed by Warriors, Melrose could have dropped the difference from trying Jason Baggot.
Climo had a criminal prosecution for the protection of Ayr, just at the mid-term, and then a one-person experiment, so the first half-time ended with 17-5 results for Ayr.
The Melrose strongly started the second half-time, Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Baggot, reducing the disadvantage of the team to five points.
Then the game stood for a long time, since Ruaridh Knott suffered severe injury and had to be taken off the track, and in the course of the extension Ayr increased its advantage by attempting Stafford McDowall, whose beans were managed by Climo.
Blair Macphereron, Captain Ayr, got a yellow card, and then Melrose managed to prevent Bruce Colvine's experiment in humanity, thereby breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started closing again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for installing Climo without a ball, MacPherson introduced a touch down from the criminal line behind the Ayr attack team.
Climo sold what was coming back almost immediately, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick, and sent Gregor Henry to take the fifth try.
Still Game's main player started a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that one of Still Game's stars, Ford Kieran, moved to the restaurant industry: it turns out that one of the restaurants was in the lead of the company.
56-year-old actress Jack Jarvist plays in the popular series of BBC, which he writes together and in which he works with his old comic partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next nineth will be the final year, and it appears Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he was the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan is trying to benefit from Glasgow's “proof restaurant industry”.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without the beach hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling around the Naval Command decorated by the sailors in La Paz.
In the centers, ocean blue flags fly.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon declare the following motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to get back."
In Bolivia without the beach, the memories of the lost beach, taken by Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century, for resources, and living strongly in the desire to rehabilitate the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been most powerful for many decades, since Bolivia is waiting for the second of October of the International Court, a judgment closing five years.
“Bolivia has the ball that floods people with the spirit of belonging and peace, waiting for the end development in a positive mood,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivia diplomat.
Many Bolivias follow the decision of the International Court of Justice, hopefully that the Hague Court stands in favour of Bolivia, and after decades of rapsodic attitudes Chile will be obligated to sit in the negotiating table so that Bolivia can have its own access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivia president of the native origin, who faces a controversial fight that he must continue for the next year's re-election, can lose much with the Monday judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he announced at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not choose to benefit Bolivia, and that would not change the situation much if its decision was still favourable to Bolivia.
The United Nations body chairing in the Netherlands has no right to judge over the areas of Chile and has also made it a prerequisite that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court was born just six months after the closing talks indicates that the case was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilei expert in international law.
Besides, the last four years she hasn't helped Bolivia, but she even took it back.
“The issue of sea exit has been addressed by the current Bolivia Government for its own purposes,” explained Zarate.
"For Morales' hostile rhetoric, the rest of the Chileans has gone away."
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue the negotiations at one point, but it will be extremely difficult to start a dialogue afterwards.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, a representative of Bolivia in Haga, disagrees with the conclusion that court decision was unusually fast.
For Monday, Bolivia is a “outstanding opportunity to open new chapters in relations with Chile” and a chance to come out well from the end of the “139 years of controversy” said.
Calzadilla also denyed that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the marine debate to create a political advantage.
“Bolicia will never give up his right to the Pacific, ” she added.
– The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it's time to go beyond the past."
North Korea: no nuclear dismantling until they can trust America
According to North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Jongho's country will not be the first to dismantle his nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the UN Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made to the leaders of the two rival countries at the Singapore Summit.
He made the remark when it seemed as though the American Minister for Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo was able to re-start the closed nuclear negotiations, over three months after the Singapore Summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Dzsongun.
Ri believes that the American obstruction of continuous sanctions and Korean war will never be enough to force North Korea on their knees.
Washington will be happy to accept the statement if Phenjan does not take significant steps towards decommissioning.
Both Kim Dzsongun and President Donald Trump want a new summit.
Phenjan, however, is committed to dismantling the arsenal, which is likely to be the only key to the security of the country.
Pompeo is planning a phenjani visit for the next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
In the Paris fashion shows, the huge head covers will soon appear in top-category shops.
If you want to expand your hammer collection or you want to cover the day completely, you don't have to look any more.
Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of unusually oversize head covers as part of their spring/summer collection in 2019, which was welcomed by the fashion seven-style Parisian audience with great enthusiasm.
Instagram has been created by un practicable hats during the summer, and the above fashion designers have also put their attention on the runway.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an overlooked belly hat that was decorated by feathery, wide karima, and almost completely absorbed the head of the models.
Among the other oversize supplements appeared with precious stones, a magical hat, and even ananas that were not really designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also made up some bizarre masks before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their mouths sewn together, and they reminded Hannibal Lecter rather than the haute couture.
One of these pieces looked like a diving mask, supplemented by pipe and glasses, and another painted like a melting oak ice cream.
If you come in with these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
According to the prediction of style analysts, huge hats are already on their way to top-class clothing stores.
The oversize hats follow the path "La Bomba", a 60 cm wide chariman, which we have seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The culture wall that conquered the social sides of a smallly practicable hat presented another piece on the runway: a swimsuit made of a swimsuit, which is almost as big as the bathing suit model.
The dark orange raphia bag, which is decorated by raphiaboots, and on top there is a white leather sticker, was one of the most outstanding pieces of Jacquemus's collection of La Riviera in spring/ summer 2019 on the Parisian fashion week.
The stylist of the stars, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: “I expect that in the next summer, huge hats and beach bags appear in the top-category clothing stores.
John Edward: Language Knowledge is essential for world citizens
Skotlanti independent schools traditionally provide excellent education. In view of the new outstanding exams, this situation has not changed until 2018, which is further enhanced by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30 000 students are already studying in institutions representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and seeking to provide the best possible services for students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen career and the position they play as world citizens.
In a educational sector where it is possible to plan and introduce personalised school curriculums, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and searched for subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak in a language that you understand, it comes to your head.
"But if you speak in his tongue, it goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder because we cannot rely on English simply if we want to build relations and trust with other countries.
From this year's exams, students in independent schools have produced the best results from foreign languages across the country.
68 per cent of all students learning foreign language reached higher A level (exceeding 85 per cent).
Based on the data gathered from SCIS 74 member schools, 72 percent of students received higher Grade A of Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish students, reached Grade A.
These results also support the fact that the independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages as essential knowledge, which will undoubtedly require children and young people in the future.
Today, languages as selected objects have become at least as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics, both independent and other schools.
The 2014 survey of the United Kingdom Committee on Employment and Vocational Training revealed that 17% of employers are facing difficulties due to the lack of linguistic knowledge of empty positions.
From this we can see that language knowledge is becoming more and more necessary for young people to run a successful career.
As foreign languages are expected to be familiar with more and more jobs, language knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when learning foreign language, he will gain lifelong persistent knowledge from which he has a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationals will automatically provide a competitive advantage to the applicants speaking in many languages.
According to YouGov’s survey, in which 4000 adults were asked in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to get involved in a foreign language and France was the only language spoken by more than 10% (15 percent) of respondents.
That is why it is important that we focus on children's language learning.
Speaking in many languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children with a better chance of procuring more important work as a grown-up.
In Scotland, every school will be engaged in other languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while several will teach languages such as mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of outstanding importance for the United Kingdom by 2020.
Whatever the area of interest for the child, you will be able to learn more languages than independent schools and train teachers who are experts in your area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and delivers them with the skills they need to succeed, to maintain whatever the future is.
It is not difficult to note that in the current global business environment, languages remain vital for the future of a country, and that education must reflect this.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should rather be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools offer choice, diversity and quality education to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien is faire – that's how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is presenting in San Diego with Lakers on Sunday
They don't have to wait much longer for fans sitting like they're gonna see LeBron James on the ground first in Los Angeles Lakers' colors.
The Coach of Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James's gonna play at the first Sunday opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you're going to spend on the field, that's a question.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton wrote on the official website of Lakers.
The reporter of Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James would probably only play for a limited time.
After a couple of days ago, James was asked what his plans for Lakers in the six-game pre-semester.
"I don't have to play at this point of my career in the pre-session to be ready," he replied.
Trump's Western Virginia campaign and YouTube channel
Donald Trump Wheeling, West Virginia, is starting a long series of campaign events tonight.
This will be the first of the five events in the Trump next week, including stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi, who supports him.
Now that Trump has been postponed to a confirmation of his candidate for the vacant place of the Supreme Court, Trump is trying to collect supporters for the next mid-term elections, as there is a risk that the Republicans lose power over the Congress when the votes run in November.
When does Trump begin tonight's Western Virginia event, and where can it be followed online?
The talk of Trump wheelingi (Nyugat-Virginia) will begin tonight, i.e. on Saturday 29 September 2018, at 7 a.m.
You can follow Trump's Western Virginia meeting online through YouTube live mediation.
Trump is likely to be touched by his supreme candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week's hearing, which was particularly stressed in the light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate's confirmatory vote was suspended for a maximum of a week until the FBI investigates.
However, the primary objective of suddenly multiplied events is to help the Republicans in their position before the elections in November.
According to Trump's campaign counselor, the next five events will serve as an activation of voters and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority currently owned in Senate and in the Assembly," says Reuters.
“In order to know the direction of the Congress in his hands, the critical point of its political plans is that the President visits as many states as possible.
The event planned today at Wesbanco in Wheeling today is “Ohio and Pennsylvania may bring supporters from States and may also enter the posts of the Pittsburgh media", says West Virginia Metro News.
It will be on Saturday for the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help his Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who, according to the surveys, is not in a favourable position.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should act personally to be more involved in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, politician of the University of Western Virginia, according to the Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: The American team is fighting with full wire to keep hope alive before Sunday individuals
After three unilateral attempts, Saturday afternoon four matches needed the Ryder cup.
Fortunately and momentum here and here, the shining shirt of a fairly aired sports club, yet every player believes in it, mostly in the races like Ryder-Cupa.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had six-point driving, and only four of them have the advantage, so we can say that we have the ball,” said Jordan Spieth, as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, with four points, Europe still leads, and it is still available for twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth tells, feel they've finally got a little back wind, and they can encourage more of all, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and both got three points out of the four.
Spieth proved wrong from the start-up to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His occupying triumphs became increasingly louder, as he went forward with the circle, invented and balanced with a critical stretch in the fourth match, so that he and Thomas were in dual disadvantage after two.
The swinging of the game has resulted in a similar quest of joy than the 15th hole, a kind that can convince the viewer that everything is lost to the U.S. team.
“You just have to dig deep in yourself and just care about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's exactly what's waiting for players.
18 holes for the chance that you leave a lead.
For the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular couple in the Ryder coup was able to get more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe is strange, but a couple of four of the four of them are in love, and it seems that they can't make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not perform over the par on Saturday afternoon, and Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine stages of Friday morning.
Thanks to this series, and the dynamics of the audience who supported them, they became the measure by Sunday, and no one expects Europe to win at the Le Golf National Race, as well as Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be the best win at the same time, at different holes.
However, it would be early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were soon executed by Sergio Garcia, his fourth hero in the morning when he played with Alex Noren.
One and two hits above the par were completed at the first nine holes in the Spanish and Swedish, which pushed them into a wave valley where they had no chance to climb out.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of your hole.
The four ball games and the four matches are extremely entertaining, thanks to the interactions of the couples. You can see what advice you give, what you don't give, and how you can change the strategy during an eyelash.
Europe has played a better team so far, and it has a significant advantage for her for the last day, but this section four has shown that the American team has the need for curass to fight, even though many of them have been missed, especially from the American side.
Europe starts with 10 to 6 the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a great advantage after ending Saturday's four balls and four matches with 10-6 results against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari's double guided the hair, harvested two wins against the weakening Tiger Woods, raising the difference to four points on the Le Golf National track.
The European team of Thomas Bjørn, who is trying to get back the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated against the constantly defective American team during the four balls in the morning, winning the series for 3-1.
America showed a greater resistance during the fours, bringing two games, but they couldn't make the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should get eight points from the 12 individual game on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel who won four points in the series, while he and Molinari, who are mentioned only as "Malliwood" after a sensational weekend, were the second pair of the history of Ryder, which had four points at the opening game.
After the four balls beat the Woods-Patrick Reed couple, their great team games defeated the unmotivated Woods and the U.S. newman, Bryson Dechambeau's double to a definite 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes he's still quieted his talent, but from 29 games, he's already lost 19 of the four balls and four, of which seven times.
Justin Rose, who rested during the four balls in the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third positions of the world-green, by 2 and 1.
However, Europe did not succeed in all this pleasant, windy day, from Paris to southwest.
The three-time address protector Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do this on Saturday two points.
A torture-served 2+1 victory was won against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls, and later they returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4+3 in the fours after they lost the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder cup, only twice a team managed to come back from the four-point disadvantage in individual competitions, although Furyk's addressees are infinitely enough to keep the trophy.
However, after being only the second best for two days, a Sunday attack seems rather unreasonable.
"Not" to take North Korea unilaterally if you do not trust your negotiating partner
The Secretary of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said to the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions only increased the distrust of the United States and, under such circumstances, the country would unilaterally deploy nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongho said at the World Organisation's Annual Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant and generous" steps over the last year, such as shutting down nuclear and missile experiments, closing the location of nuclear experiments, and promised not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
“ Unfortunately, we do not see similar responses from the Americans, ” she said.
– At the very low level of trust in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not guaranteed, and in such circumstances, it is not possible that we be unleashed unilaterally and firstly."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's disappointment about Washington's opposition to the idea of "smart" nuclear dismantling, which, according to the scenario, would receive benefits from North Korea for the steps taken so far, however, it seemed significant because it did not clearly reject unilateral decommissioning, as Phenjan has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Dzsongun and Donald Trump at the first summit of the world, between the powered American President and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June, and in which Kim promised to work on the nuclear dismantling of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump guaranteed the inviolability of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to be able to officially do so at the end of the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States believes Phenjan needs to give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington didn't allow serious international sanctions in the North Korea.
“ America insists that we start with nuclear decommissioning and that it will increase the pressure to force us his will and also object to the issue of the ending of war, ” said Ri.
– The idea that sanctions can force us on the knees is a desire for people who don't know us.
The problem is that non-relieving sanctions only increase our suspicion."
Ri did not mention that a second summit between Kim and Trump was planned, but the President of the United States has spoken separately in the UN at the beginning of the week.
The Minister pointed out that three meetings were held between Kim and the South Korean President Mun Dzsein for the last five months and added: “If the country concerned with nuclear decommissioning were South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear dismantling of the Korean Peninsula would not have taken place.”
However, the voice of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the targeting of the North American continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump, the wicked President, Kimet, called a "armman" who is on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with "full destruction" last year, was praising Kim to have the courage to take steps towards decommissioning, but also pointed out that there is a lot of work left, and the sanctions will remain until North Korea executes nuclear decommissioning.
Wednesday Trump said that no time limit was set, i.e. "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council could reward Phenjan for the steps that have been taken so far.
On the other hand, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said in the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Sanctions of the Security Council must be disregarded until they have achieved the actual, final, proven nuclear decommissioning.”
The Security Council has maintained sanctions against North Korea unanimously since 2006 to reduce financing of Phenjan's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Rív at the break of the United Nations Assembly, and then he said he's going back to Phenjan in the next month to prepare the second summit.
Pompeo's been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip wasn't so good.
After he left Phenjan in July, he announced that progress had been made, however, North Korea accused him of bringing up “gengster-like claims” hours later.
North Korea promised to decommission a missile base and a nuclear facility in the course of the meeting with Mun this month, if the United States will take "the appropriate steps".
According to Mun, the “required steps” mentioned by Kim would be security guarantees which Trump promised in Singapore and steps that could lead to the normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are trained to rest enough
This year, a new subject of the Harvard University has curbed students for more sleep, fighting the entire nightly learning against the growing field of macho culture.
One academy concluded that students of the world's number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care for themselves.
The course that he believed was the first such training in the USA, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who taught sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical College and practised as a doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged the development of the course to have a lecture earlier on the impact of sleeping disruption on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I faced with this at the end of the year?’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleep that surprised me," said he to the Telegraph.
During the first course launched this year, students will be informed of the fundamental impact of the appropriate sleep habits on their study and sport performance, other than having a positive impact on their general publicity.
According to Paul Barreira, the psychiatrist professor at Harvard University of Medicine and the head of the health service of the university, the university decided to launch the course because in the week the students were found to be extremely unsleashed.
The one-time course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
One example shows a picture of a college room where students can click on cafés, curtains, gymnastics and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance affects sleeplessness and why sleeping routine is important.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleepover increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
They present the map of the university with interactive icons to help participants reconsider daily routines.
“We know that we will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to such knowledge – as they have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture in which performance is expected to be an overnight, said, adding that the constant increasing pressure on modern technology and students leads to increasing problems of sleeplessness.
Enough and quality sleep is a “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even protecting from obesity, because sleep is forced into a hungry way and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemistry and biophysics, and last year Harvardon took one of the professor's courses first.
He said that they heard him open his eyes and encouraged him to start a university-level training.
It hopes that, as a next step, post-gradual students will be able to participate in a similar training programme before being placed in the competition sector.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students put a warning to sleep, wake up to awakening, and meet the harmful effects of the electrical screens and the "blue light" from LED sources, which can easily remove them from the daily rhythm and make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1–0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and gets a goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb had Steven Gerrard's crashed team in Livingston.
The Ibroxians tried to get their first foreign victory after the victory of February, St. Johnstone, 4-1, but Gerrard's second defeat from Gary Holt's team as the manager of the 18th game, so they stay eight points away from the first post of the Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish Championship), the Hearts.
Menga hit me seven minutes before the half-time, and the unmotivated team of Rangers hasn't even been able to equilibrium.
While the Rangers slipped to the sixth place, Livingston was struggling to the third, leaving Hibernian behind because of the goal difference.
Furthermore, Rangers may face further difficulties after the coastal warning Calum Spence's head injury has resulted in medical care due to an object probably thrown away from the guests' sightseeing.
Gerrard changed eight points on the team that got into the Betfred cup's premiere by squeezing Ayr.
Dead was going to the Livingston with the same 11 men who picked up a point from Hearts last week, and he would have had a happy look at his perfect team smothering his opponent's game wherever he was.
Although Rangers were driving in the ball store, Livingston took more than what he had.
You could've gotten a goal in the first two minutes when Menga started Scott Pittman to the gates of Allan McGregor, but the middle tracker couldn't sell the chips.
Keaghan Jacobs was landed at the Craig Halkett team captain, but his defendant Alan Lithgow just found the gate side.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved a criminal at the 15th minute when he encountered Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson was able to file his complaints in Colombia.
The Rangers could only show two first half-age capabilities, but the former Ibrox gate, Liam Kelly, was hardly the problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi's attempts in 34 minutes faced the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, only for their hard work.
The Rangers again missed a zipper forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react in time when Declan Gallagher put the ball in to Scott Robinson, who did greatly find Menga for easy finishing.
Gerrard decided to change Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and that almost immediately explained the effect on the game when the extremist Morelost jumped, but Kelly blocked the impressive form in time.
Livingston continued to play exactly the game that suited him, and Lithgow and Halkett sliced the long balls after each other.
Holt's team could have had a greater advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net well and smashed Jacobs' position before Lithgow was inclined from a nail.
As the Rangers exchange, Glenn Middleton tried to fight another eleven when he got stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson was still unconvinced.
Almanach: inventor of the Geiger Counter
One details of our “wedding breakfast” almanach: 30 September 1882, now exactly 136 years ago... the day when the later physicist John Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that could have been created by a device known as the Geiger accountant.
The Geiger accountant has been one of the basic tools of science since then, and thanks to the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which includes strange cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, became part of the pop culture:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger accountant, radioactive minerals, such as uranium, can be found with him.
"If you put this headphone, you can hear the sound of the atoms that are released because of the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: “Hey, listen, he's doing enough now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But he lives in his invention with his name.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to ‘cancer’ the abnormal cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to ‘stork’ and destroy abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of treatment will teach the immune system to detect abnormal cells.
It is part of the method that immune cells should be extracted from the patient and then changed in a lab.
This is how they can “see” the protein that is accompanied by a variety of cancers, and the treated immune cells are reintroduced to the patient.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells has been able to say good-bye to her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
It is part of the method of obtaining immunocells from the patient; their modification in the laboratory to ‘see’ the protein called HER2 which is a common contributor to various types of cancer; then the reintroduction of cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the National Cancer Research Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: "My results allow us to conclude that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 explains the growth of multiple cancers, including breast, ovaries, lungs and cortex, Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method based on highlighting immunocells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has been used successfully in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West SNL's reproduction with the MAGA cap was excellent in a trumpt-supporting tirade.
It didn't go well.
Kanye Westet was stretched in the Saturday Night Live studio after an inconsistent manifestation in which he spoke to President Donald Trump and then informed him that he would apply for the presidential position in 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, Make America Great Again, he started to speak against the democrats and reiterated that Trump was supported.
“How can you like Trump because you are racist, when I talk to someone who is white, how can you like Trump?”
If you were interested in racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show was opened by Matt Damon with a parodia in which the Hollywood star was spooked by Brett Kavanaugh on his statement before the Senate Justice Committee on the sexual harassment of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's lecture was uploaded by Chris Rock, a humorist on the social pages.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make a joke from West with the charge.
West even complained to the audience that he was smashed behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They were frightened behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat".
I'm scared!
And they said I was in the sink place," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see where I came from, and I will wear my Superman rope, because that means they can’t tell me what to do.
Try with love."
His statements were at least twice haunted by a whistle from the audience, and SNL’s actors apparently felt embarrassed by one of the witnesses who declared Variety: “The whole studio was covered in silence. ”
Westet was invited to singer Ariana Grande at the last moment, whose former friend Mac Miller rapper died a few days before.
West asked questions, among other things, when I Love it was dressed as a Perrier glass.
Westet, head of the Conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, provided his support in a tweet: “One of the bravest spirits: THE GOVERNMENTS WHEN THEY WAS GOVERNED.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a chat show, tweeted that West was simply “self, and that's great”.
“But I have decided not to reward someone (with the purchase of his music or his fashion articles or the ‘arts’), which I believe is an ideology and distribution that is harmful to the community that I belong to.
He's free.
But we did," he said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, now he “the creature previously known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's entering Diddy's trails, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
Snoop Dogg, his Rapper mate, also recorded the name of Snoop Lion, and, of course, his former legend, Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the star of the Thrones, finds exaggerated maleness harmful
Kit Harington is mostly known as the Throne's fight as Jon Snow, and in the middle-time fantasy series of HBO's violence, you are often stuck with swords.
However, 31-year-old actress spoke against the stereotypical macho heroes, pointing out that when such heroes see, little boys often feel that a hard act is needed to fight respect.
In his statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something went wrong" and raised the question of how to deal with the problem of damage to overmarried maleity in the #MeToo era.
The star who recently married his 31-year-old, serial colleague, Rose Leslie, told me that it was very important to remedy the problem.
“ I personally have been deeply affected by this matter — how was the image of maleness so distorted? ” asked the actor.
– What have we taught men when they were kids about the problem we are dealing with?"
According to Kit, the television is also responsible for the spread of the distorted image of maleness, as programs often show very masculinous characters.
He added: “What is the thing that was born with us, and what is what we learn?
What does the street and the TV send to the young boys, which makes them feel like men can only be like this?
I think that is one of the big questions of our age - and how we can change this.
'Cause it clearly seems that something is wrong with young men."
During the interview, Kit stated that after the summer season of the series, Tróns will not be included in the series or continuations of the War, because “he is hungry from the battlegrounds and horses”.
From November on, Kit Sam Shepard will play a major role in reprocessing the True West movie, which is about a producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor told me that the best thing he got from the Thrones fight was the wife, Rose he knew when he was making the show.
“I met my wife in the shooting, so my future family and my life ahead of me, thanks to the series,” said Kit.
He made Rose Ygritte, who was Kit's character, Jon Snow, the love of the Emmy Award fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new patients increased by 14% in China
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14% in the country.
According to health officers, this represents more than 820 000 subjects.
In the second quarter of 2018 only, the number of reported cases increased by around 40 000.
Compared to the previous ones, a significant majority of newly infected people are sexually exposed to the disease.
In some parts of China, the disease spread rapidly.
However, at a conference held in the Province of Jünnan, health officials stated that the number of such cases has been reduced to almost zero since then.
However, the number of HIV and AIDS people in China increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
Sexual transfer of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LMBT community.
homosexualism has not been considered a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against society has been very strong since then.
Based on the estimates in various studies, 70% of men who have sexual relations with other men eventually marry women because of the conservative order of the country.
The disease is spread in these relationships in many cases due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has been providing universal access to HIV medicines as part of the problem-solving programme.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff would have leaked the data of Republican Senators and condemned "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the American representative Maxine Waters rejected the accusations that a member of his station published the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia site of Senators.
According to the democratic representative in Los Angeles, these claims have been distributed by “external right” experts and web sites.
"Life, lie, and more evil lies," said Waters on Twitter.
The information published was allegedly included in the address and telephone number of Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
The information was released on the Internet on Thursday. The person who published it is unknown, but it is sure that they were published on the Capitoldom, during the supreme hearing of Brett Kavanaugh on sexual harassment.
The leak happened shortly after the three Senator Kavanaughs asked.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundi and RedState, can be linked to the source IP address Waters office, and they also communicated information about one of the members of the Waters station, written by The Hill.
“These charges are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars, ” continued Waters.
– My member has no responsibility to leak the information; however, his right to anonymity, personal data and security has been damaged by fraudulent and liar charges.
"These charges are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars."
Waters' statements were written on the Internet soon with criticism, including the critics of Ari Fleischer, the former press secret of the White House.
“This is an angry denial, ” wrote Fleischer.
– On this basis, Waters seems not to have the blood balance required for its representative duties.
If someone is suspected of something he didn't do, he can't react angryly.
You can't be mad.
You can't question the motives of the defendant.
You have to stay calm and calm."
Waters' reaction to Mr. Fleischer seems to have been compared to the response of Judge Kavanaugh's political criticism, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is a Republican candidate for the position of Waters in mid-term elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's serious", he wrote in his message.
In his communication, Waters wrote that his office informed the “compliant authorities and police bodies” about false charges.
“We make sure that the person of the perpetrators learns – continued Waters – and that they should be legally liable for any action that threatens or damages any member of my staff."
Johnny English hits again, or Rowan Atkinson's paranoid spy play
Today, it has become a tradition that we are looking for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there is no exception from this, neither the franchise, which runs under the Johnny English name, is included in the category of action warp/parody, whose first part, Johnny English in 2003, second, Johnny English, was reloaded in 2011.
Will the new export product of the British nation become the sarcasm satries that paradise ourselves, in which we are inclined on our own obvious paralysis?
It is so certain that the garbage stiff, gumous, incompetent Johnny English had enough ammunition for a new return – it is also clear from its name that this comic character has been created so that the masses of people watching the world in the movies of non-English native countries can laugh at it.
Johnny English, of course, is an idiot secret agent who thinks he's in a bizarre manner, so he reminds me a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who contributed to the opening of the London Olympics in 2012 with a single key press.
The character was originally based on the mysterious international journey that Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, and left a chaos everywhere.
There's a couple of good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English dressed in a medieval armor approaching a helicopter, and then the rotors got there for a few moments on his helmet.
Atkinson's comic vein is well applied in the film, but the humor doesn't really work, even if it's overwhelming, because nowadays "scient" franchises like James Bond movies or the Mission Impossible series are bravely touching the humor device.
To feel that the humor of the film is more targeting children, and to me, Johnny English is flicker, and his adventures failed to reach the level of idealism and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Great Britain is in a serious danger.
A cyber criminal broke into the super-secret online network of the British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the most frightened agent Kevin Eldon, who, unfortunately, had only such a small role in the film.
This could be the last angle to the coffin of the self-dealed and shared Prime Minister, whose political popularity is also ruined: Emma Thompson practically transforms Theresa May and brings everything out of the poorly written character.
The intelligence advisors suggest that, since all the active agents were found out, you have to put a calm agent on the job.
This calm agent, of course, is the two-sided Johnny English, who has worked as a teacher since his retreat, but, different from the subject, teaches children to spy – there are, of course, funny scenes, while English describes the foundations of spying as "Rocksuli".
English will be transported quickly to Whitehall, where you will meet with your former, much suffering armed carrier, Bough, who is now being shaped by Ben Miller.
Bough has been married, and she has married a submarine captain, whose mouth is always in the ear – Captain Vicki Pepperdine, who has a much better role to play.
Thus, his Majesty’s national security service will be reintroduced to action as a woman of the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, who will face Ophelia Bulletov as a true destiny.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is increasingly engaging in the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to solve the digital problems of Great Britain: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy is making it.
English and Bough start their clown missions: the waiter is disguised to light a fancy French restaurant, and then they smuggle themselves into Volta luxusjacht, and English actually frees the hell when you try to get to know Volta's apartment using a VR-head.
These stations would be needed to get to the final development, but any cheerfulness and recurrence could make a little too much impression of a child movie.
The outcome is rather mediocre.
As with the other Johnny English movies, I have the question: would the British film industry not be able to finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
The British Labour Party denys that it would take a four-day job while paying the British five-day salary.
Jeremy Corbyn's working party is working on a radical draft for the four-day work week, all by working for five-day salary.
The party allegedly wants workers to benefit from the revolution of artificial intelligence (MI) by providing workers with an extra free day thanks to increased income.
According to the draft, workers would have a three-day weekend while taking as much as they have before.
According to the resources, the idea would be "suitable" to the party's economic programme, which aims at putting the balance sheet language on the side of the workers in the country.
It also supports the idea of a four-day working week in the Congress of Professional Associations, and they believe that workers can profit from the changing economy.
One of the leading officials of the Working Party said to Sunday Times: “The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen from one day to another, the four-day working week is an idea that fits well into the party's programme that would place the balance in the economy towards the workers, it also fits the party's comprehensive industrial strategy."
The Working Party would not be the first to support such an idea, but the Green Party has already campaigned in the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of a four-day working week.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Work Party as a whole.
The spokesman of the Working Party said: “The four-day working week is not one of the policies supported by the Party, and the issue is not yet on the agenda.”
Mr John McDonnell, Minister for Shadow Finance, presented his idea of the Socialist Revolution on the economy at last week's Labour Conference.
McDonnell said he was willing to fight to get the power back from the "nothing directors" and the "beneficiary" of the regime companies.
If the plans of the shadow-financial minister were to be implemented, the shareholders of the water-sharing companies would not receive the full profits they receive, while a working party government would “deductions” as a punishment of the harmful activities they consider.
McDonnell also confirmed that it planned to make workers a member of the Board of Directors and to establish Inclusive Ownership Funds that would transfer 10% of the shares of private sector companies to workers, who could thus obtain 500 important dividends a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy have betrayed the 60 Minutes show whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
As a result of the FBI investigation initiated against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, at least a week later, the final vote on Kavanaugh's electoral election will be held.
In his "60 minutes" Sunday interview, journalist Scott Pelley, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked republica Senators if the FBI could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less engaged than his colleague in South Carolina.
“ Of course, of course, ” Kennedy said.
- I said that before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called to explode the case, after the charges appeared, and I asked, ‘Do you?’
Your answer was strong and clear."
But Graham's vote seems to be concretely secure.
“I have already decided about Brett Kavanaugh, and I need extremely serious accusations to change my mind, ” said Graham.
– Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denyed all the claims – she added to Graham, Christine Blasey Ford.
- And none of the people named Dr. Ford proved the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new will turn out."
What is the festival of the Global Citizens and has it managed to mitigate poverty?
On Saturday, New York begins the music event organized every year, the World Citizen Festival. World stars in the festival are performing to stand for a really noble goal: global eradication of poverty.
The World Citizen will be arranged for a seventh time, expected to spend the Great Park of Central Park, where participants can not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: to eradicate the deep poverty by 2030.
The global civil festival was first organised in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty project. The project is run by an international-interest group aimed at eliminating poverty by integrating more and more people in the active fight against poverty.
They can receive a free ticket for the concert (even if they are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket) who are committed to carrying out certain tasks or "actions", such as taking a voluntary job, sending an e-mail to a leading politician, a telephone call or any other significant activity to draw attention to the project's purpose: to eradicate poverty.
But, in fact, how successful has the global citizen been in achieving the targets for the last 12 years?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with the concert to convince others of the importance of action, or is it just another form of "clictivism" when people feel that they have made a case worthwhile by signing an online petition or writing a Twitter message?
Since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been carried out by the beneficiaries of the project, which have served a number of different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to separating world leaders $37 billion into policies and commitments against poverty, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and notifications that they were derived from their actions, they already paid $10 billion or collected during the collection of funds.
The group estimates that the money collected was directly affected by nearly 649 million people.
The Power of Nutrition is one of the main commitments, which is a partnership between investors and exporters in the United Kingdom, with the aim of ‘ helping children achieve their potential’.
“With support of the United Kingdom Government and the donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can exile social injustices and under-food among the footnotes of history books,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of Power of Nutrition, on a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also argues that after the UK was requested in more than 5000 actions to improve the food of their mothers and children, the government has allocated resources for the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the food of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently published questions on the website of the global citizen is: “Why do you think that the deep poverty can be eliminated?"
According to the Global Citizen: “It will be a long and difficult journey that sometimes fails and sometimes fails.
But like the previous anti-civil and anti-segregation movements, we will achieve our goal, because we are stronger together."
Among other things, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year's New York event, and the show leaders will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister of Interior: the United States would use a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports
"If necessary", Washington would also take the Navy against the introduction of Russian energy carriers to the market, for example, the Russian energy could not reach the Middle East, quoted Mr Ryan Zinke, American Minister of Interior, Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's active presence in Syria, particularly as regards Russian operations carried out at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is merely an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they are only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe,” said Zinke in a statement.
And the Minister of Home Affairs says there are ways to prevent Russians.
“The United States can ensure that sea routes are open and that they can be blocked if necessary, so that Russian energy can not enter markets,” said Zinke.
Zinke provided its words to participants in a non-profit event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – otherwise the non-profit group defines itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his talk, Washington compared his action against Russia and Iran and noted that it was practically the same methods.
"Iran and Russia can be punished economically in the same way: using existing energy carriers and introducing new ones", said Zinke, while calling Russia a "one-dimensional economy", pointing out the country's dependence on fossil energy carriers.
The statements coincide with the Trump Government's plan to export liquid natural gas to Europe, thereby removing Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, the head officials of the Trump Government, including the President himself, will convince Germany to reverse the "inappropriate" pipeline project called the North Stream 2, which, if it is done, will make Moscow a "contact" of Germany.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the existing capacity duplicate, thus increasing to 110 billion cubic metres, North Electricity of 11 billion dollars, 2 wires are exclusively an economic project.
According to Kremlin, Washington's economic considerations oppose the project so strongly, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
"I assume that we are in the same position as that energy should not be used for pressure exercises and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers freely", said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Minister for Energy in Moscow.
The attempt to convince the Americans has gone backwards because Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation of Germany, the German Industry Association (BDI), called on the United States not to intervene in the EU's energy policy, as it would keep itself away from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I consider it a problem when a third state interferes with our energy issues,” said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industrial Association (BDI), after the last meeting of Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putyin.

Senator Elizabeth Warren massachusettsi on Saturday said that after the mid-term elections, he'd “think a lot of consideration” to go for the presidency.
Warren Massachusetts, at a city meeting in Saintoke, confirmed that he was considering leaving.
“It is time for women to enter Washington and place the poor government, and it is time for a woman to be president, ” said Warren, The Hill.
I'll take serious consideration after 6 November to pick up the presidency."
At the city meeting, Warren criticised Donald Trump, saying that he said he was “willing the country in a bad direction”.

Sarah Palin referred to the PTSD of Track Palin at Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after he came in September
He was arrested for domestic violence on Monday night.
"When my son goes through what he's been going through since he got home, I understand the other families who experience the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are returning home," Sarah Palin told the audience at the Tulsai meeting in Donald Trump Oklahoma.
Palin's son called his arrest as an elephant in the room, and said that his son, like the other war veterans, was “changed, hardened to come back, and constantly wondering whether the service that their comrades, pilots and all the other members of the army have done for the country.”
Track Palin was arrested in the Alscan Wasillia by accusing domestic violence against a woman.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the review of the new U.S. asylum policy in order to ensure that those who are fleeing violence by bands or within the family are not allowed asylum.
The 18 representatives from different Member States and Washington D.C. wrote an expert letter in Washington on Friday to support a asylum seeker who attacks politics in court, writes NBC News.
The full name of the defendant of Grace vs. Sessions initiated by the American Civil Rights Union in August against federal policy was not published.
According to the claimant woman, his partner and the sons of a violent criminal attacked him, but on July 20th, American officials rejected his asylum request.
The woman is being held in Texas.
Prosecutors in the countries supporting Grace El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have been describing places where many asylum requests to the United States come from, because in these countries there is a constant problem with crime bands and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has withdrawn a decision taken by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) Committee on the Appeal of Immigrants in 2014, which allows immigrants who do not have documents to flee domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C.’s Attorney General stated in a Friday communication that the new policy “will ignore decades of state, federal and international law.
“All asylum applications under federal law must be addressed in the context of the facts and circumstances, where appropriate, and such an obstacle infringes this principle,” says the expert letter.
The prosecutors also stated in the letter that the anti-immigration policy harms the American economy, as immigrants are more likely to be entrepreneurs and “to fill lowest levels of jobs”.
In June, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed asylum judges not to give asylum rights to victims of domestic violence and crime bands.
“The right of refuge is to leave his country because of the racial, religious, national background, debt to a specific social group or the justified fear of persecution or persecution,” says Sessions on 11 June at the time of the policy announcement.
The right to asylum has not been found to solve the problems of people worldwide every day — whether they are of serious nature.
Desperate rescue in Palu, the number of the dead doubled, the paramedics run a race with time
The situation of survivors is becoming more and more unprecedented.
“Everyone is very tense, ” says Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, while restoring a young boy with fever in one of the evacuation centers of Palu’s catastrophe.
- The ambulances will bring the bodies every minute.
We barely have drinks."
Some of the residents returned to their homes to save them out of the wet stuff that can still be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals that have also been corrupted by earthquake 7.5 will not be able to deliver people.
Some of the victims, including the broken spine and shoulder Dwi Haris, were transported to the Palui Military Hospital. The patients were delivered outside the hospital building because of the great strength of afterquakes.
The man’s eyes filled with tears when he recalled the fifth floor hotel room in which he and his wife and daughter were occupied in the destructive excitement.
“There was no time to escape.
I think I needed to be among the fallen walls – Haris spoke to the Associated Press and then added that his family came to town for a wedding.
- I heard my wife scream for help, and then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The American Ambassador accuses China of propagandisting the country
The Chinese ambassador of the United States accused Beijing of spreading propagand in the US press, one week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided ad in an American newspaper that highlighted the mutual benefits of American-China trade relations.
Last Wednesday, the American President Donald Trump referred to the ad published in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa’s biggest copy, while accused China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections in November 6th. China denys the charge.
Trump is accused of trying to intervene with the American elections, according to some American officials who declare Reuters, it constitutes a new phase of Washington China's ever-intensive action aimed at putting China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertisements, the trade war between Beijing and Washington is becoming increasingly intensive in order to impose new and new duties on each other's import products.
According to American and Chinese experts, at the beginning of the trade war, the Chinese customs duties were aimed at exporters of the countries in which Trump and the Republican Party are popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese ambassador of the United States and the former governor of Iowa for several cycles, stated that Beijing harmed the American workers, farmers and businesses, as the State of Iowa exported significant quantities of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, that “China still exerts our country by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“The Chinese Government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and press with great respect by distributing propaganda in paid advertisements in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
– However, if we go to a newspaper store in Beijing, we barely find critical articles. The Chinese press does not faithfully reflect the views of Chinese people on the growing growth prospects of the Chinese economy, since the media is under strict control of the Communist Party of China."
Branstad added that “one of the most important newspapers in China was not willing to leave” his article, but he did not mention the newspaper.
Elements suggest that the Republicans can alienate women voters before the mid-term elections with Kavanaugh.
According to the record, many high-performance Republican politicians will take Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate to protect in the crossfire of sexual harassment charges, especially in the absence of support for female voters before the mid-term elections.
The case triggered intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly stated that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be recovered – states Grant Reeher, a politician of the University of Syrians at Maxwell School, in a Saturday article of The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts about the fact that the Flake Republican Senator Jeff Flake's recent investigation by Arizona will be sufficient to reassure the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – neither tomorrow nor November,” said a newspaper resident in Washington, D.C., said Karine Jean-Pierre, head consultant and national speaker of the progressive group MoveOn on Friday.
According to Mic's report on Friday morning, some protesters at the Senate corridor scanned "November is moving" because the Republican Justice Committee, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, decided not to revoke Kavanaugh's mark.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will jump to an amazing extent," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“Some times it has been very tall, and that is true.
But it can be even higher, especially among the unsure female voters in the suburbs and young (18-29 years) who are not enthusiastic for the President, but often do not go to vote."
The analysts have already assumed before Ford was publicly confessed that he could hit the Republicans if they continued to stand by Brett Kavanaugh. Since then, Ford described in detail why sexual harassment accused the supreme court candidate.
“The Republican Party was mistaken for a normal soil,” said the NBC News said at the beginning of the last week, Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Commission.
“This is not just the vote on the Commission and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is named, but also the way the Republicans handled the case and the way they acted with Ford,” highlighted the President of the United States of America who helped election of the Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans have quite shared whether Ford or Kavanaugh's confession is true. Kavanaugh is a little more than Ford.
According to YouGov's new survey, 41% of respondents fully or more believed Ford's testimony and 35% of respondents gave the same answer.
In addition, 38% of the respondents believe Kavanaugh probably lied to her statement, while only 30% of Ford believed that.
As a result of Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the authenticity of Ford's claims, as is the case with Kavanaugh's other defendant, Deborah Ramirez's claims, written by Guardian.
Ford swore a week ago to the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez argued that the supreme candidate showed him his genital organ at a party in the 1980s when both of them studied at Yale.
The inventor of the world web would start a new internet to face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, starts with the aim of launching a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee on Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where I want to store their data and who can have access to each information.
In his exclusive interview to Fast Company, Berners-Lee was joking about the intention of Inrupt to “buy over the world”.
“We have to do this now, ” she said about the start.
- It's a historic moment."
With Solid technology, the application allows people to create their own "personal online storage", namely POD.
This may include lists, lists of to-dos, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available at the same time.
In the personal online storage, it is unique that the user can fully decide who to access its data.
This is what the company calls the "enforcement of the right to self-regulate persons over data".
John Bruce, Director-General of Inrupt, says that the company is responsible for ensuring resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of a security platform purchased from Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some contracted developers working in the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards world technology developers can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt page.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team do not ask "Facebook and Google whether to use the entire change technology, which would set up business models from one day to the other."
"We don't ask for permission from them."
In the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt “to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the newly built network on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts University of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an important opinion-former in recent months in discussions on the neutrality of the Internet.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am infinitely optimistic about the next age of the world network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann was celebrating a minister in the First World War of Victory
The only Christian Christian in Victoria was celebrated by his hometown in England for 100 years after executing his heroes in the first world war.
Reverend Bern Vann and Colonel Bern earned the medal during the attack on Belganglise and Leacourt of 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him so he could never know he deserved the highest prize of British armed forces.
The memorial stone was covered by his two grandchildren at a Saturday celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire County.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “ symbolic” that the memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather's medalation.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Bernard Vann and the Colonel led his flag through the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel “the dense fog and the fire of a heavy cannon and machine.
Later, he rushed into the archipelago and stood at the top of the flagship with a “outstanding heroism”, and then incinerated a campian cannon unit, harming its three members.
On October 4, 1918, Bernard Vann, honorable and unleashed by a German sniper, only one month before the end of the war.
“I know that I can never get to what my grandfather did, and that taught me humility, ” said his grandfather, Michael Vann, a 72 - year - old.
After the adventure led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have corroborated the memorial stone.
Michael Vann said that he was honored to play a part in the celebration, and then added: “A true hero’s victories are shown by how many of them will express their respects later.”
The OCT enthusiasms have been refreshed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of getting Peppa pigs.
Imagine he's been awake all night so he could see the exciting Bellator 206, and then the transmission's gone.
The San José programme had 13 clashes, six of which were broadcast live in the United Kingdom, channel 5 channels of Channel 5 as part of the main competition.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the English viewers were not a little surprise for the game instead of Peppa pig.
This was difficult for many who stayed up until the morning hours because of this confrontation.
Instead of the MMA game, one of the fans of "sick jokes" used to describe a child drawing film on Twitter.
“The public regulation states that this content could not be transmitted by the channel at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, the head of the Bellator Department for Communication and Marketing.
- Yes, it's Peppa, the pig's time."
Scott Coker, President of the Bellator company, promised that in the future, they'd rework the schedule of the show to take account of the United Kingdom viewers.
“ I think we can do this by repeating it, ” Coker said.
– However, since it is Sunday morning 6:00, until our time Sunday, which they have on Monday, we can't fix the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show switched, there were a lot of messages, and most of them weren't quite friendly.
First we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix the error.
But it wasn't that, it was a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
Instead of six so far, there will be only five matches in the program – we would very much like to make it to the viewers, but we accounted for ourselves.
"It was a miserable situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley's minority complex due to sexual orientation
Tom Daley's art jumping Olympics said that when he was young, he felt lower than everyone, because of his sexual orientation, but that made the motivation to succeed.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, he didn't notice that "everyone isn't like him."
In the radio show called Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, Lauren Laverne told me to stand up for gay rights to give others a “reason”.
He added that since he was a parent, he was much less interested in the Olympics.
The permanent director of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, missed months of disease.
In Laverne's first show, Daley invited her as a shipwreck, saying that she felt as a young person as a “lefter” than anyone else, because “socially she was unacceptable if someone loved boys and girls as well.”
He said: “To this day, the feeling of subtleness and diversity is a feeling of endurance and strength in order to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he too was “something ” so that he would not disappoint everyone when he felt sexually fit.
The double-minded bronze jumper has become a well-known representative of the LMBT community, and he has requested world governments to decriminate homosexuality in the countries of the world, using his role in this year's national community games in Australia.
He said that he called on the matter because he felt lucky that he could live without open, negative consequences, and wanted to give others a “reason. ”
The three-fold world champion said that he was “full surprised by the situation” when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, the American filmmaker, who he first met in 2013.
Daley and his 20-year-old Oscar Awardist got married last year, claiming that age difference never meant a problem between them.
“When a man goes through so much in his youth, ” he said, “he was 14 years old in his first Olympic and his father died in cancer three years later, ” he finds it hard to find someone in his age class who experienced similar extreme experiences.
The couple of Junes adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
“ If you asked me this question last year, I would have said that the most important thing is to win a gold medal is, ” he said.
But you know what I realized? There are more important things than my Olympic gold coins.
My Olympic gold coin, Robbie."
The name of the child was Robert after Daley's father, who died in 2011, 40 years after diagnosed her brain tumour.
According to Daley's statement, his father didn't want to accept that he was going to die, and one of the last questions was whether we have tickets for London's 2012 Olympics because he wanted to sit in the first line.
“I was uncomfortable to answer to him that ‘father, you will no longer be there in the first line,’ he quoted.
“I was holding my hand when she stopped breathing, but until the moment I could not accept that my father was not injured, ” she said.
The following year Daley attended the 2012 Olympics and got the bronze.
“I realized that this is what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in the Olympic Games in front of a home audience, and that is not a better feeling,” he said.
The number Heather Small Proud (Boldness) helped him much in the preparation of the Olympics, and to this day, he's going to be sober when he hears it.
The Desert Island Disc on Sunday, local time starts at 11:15 on the BBC Radio 4 show.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he went to Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson can set a record by taking part in the 47th Cup game on the Ryder Coupon Sunday, but he must win back his form if he doesn't want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson's record plays 12 times at the organised event every two years, due to its performance in Saturday's four balls and four games, Jim Furyk's team captain sent it to the bay.
Instead of winning five winners in the great races, it would be at the center of events, like many times when it had to fight for the victory of the United States, now in one half of the day the team is cheering, spending the other half on the track and trying to correct the errors that weaken the game.
At the top of her career, she never belonged to the finest bats, so the 48-year-old player does not really lie on the narrow course of the Le Golf National, where the high grass has to pay a very high price for the wrong hits.
And if the track wasn't quite scary in itself, Mickelson was on Sunday, the ninth match is facing the precisely playing Francesco Molinari English champions who won all the four games this week with Tommy Fleetwood as the beginner.
If the Americans starting with a four-point disadvantage before 12 individual matches are strong, then Mickelson's game can be crucial.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“You are fully aware of the role you had in today’s development, and you have miscarried my back, covered me, and promised you that you would be ready for tomorrow, ” Furyk said.
- Very confident.
He's one of the biggest ones, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and the last week.
Basically, I didn't intend two games for him.
I planned more, but in this situation, we decided that it was the best solution.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else."
With Mickelson's role on Sunday, he's gonna kick Nick Faldo's record, who hasn't played more games in the Ryder Cup.
With this, you can close a series of Ryder cup that is far from the player's individual performance.
Mickelson 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven infinites, however Furyk pointed out that the presence of the veteran player is not a tangible advantage for the team.
“ Vicces, sarcasm, spiritic, likes to joke with others, a great team member, ” she explained.
– I think younger players enjoyed the games they played against him, and it's good to see it.
His presence goes beyond the strictly strictly meaningd game."
Mr Bjørn, captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their advantage.
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team's experience knows that even if someone has a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, it can easily turn his back on him.
The Danish player first showed himself in an 1997 valderrama match, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage against the Americans, and at the end they just managed to maintain a haircut for the 141⁄2–31⁄2 win.
“We must always remind ourselves that we have gained a great advantage in Valderrama, yet we have won only a haircut, and we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out of it,” said Bjørn in the picture after class 5 to 3 of 2018 and yesterday, leading to 10 to 6 of Le Golf National.
– We're thinking about the competitions of the previous years, and everyone will see that the game isn't over.
You'll have to play full-time tomorrow.
So let's go and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have a goal that is to win this trophy, and now we need to focus on it.
As I said before, I am mostly dealing with the 12 players of our team, but we also need to look at the other side, who are historically among the world's greatest players."
Bjørn, who is proud of the team’s performance in the difficult course, added: “I would never be prophesied in such a situation.
Tomorrow's a whole different pasta.
Then everything depends on individual performances, which is completely different than the team game.
It's a great feeling to play in a couple when things go well, but when you stand out individually, you'll always find out what a golfer really is.
That's what we need to understand with the players to get the best of you out of the field tomorrow.
They have to break off their partner, who will also have to bring the best form."
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Furyk, the captain of his opponent team, expressly trusts that his players will perform better individually than in a couple, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points from the four.
Furyk personally has experienced both sides of the last day's resurrections: he was a member of the winning team in Brookline, and then he was on the loser side of the European team, mentioned as the "Clear of Media".
“ I remember all the damn words, ” she answered when she was asked because she encouraged the players before the last day in 1999 by team captain Ben Crenshaw.
– We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but we're going to start as fast as we saw in Brookline as we saw in Medinah.
If one of the teams is really intruding, it'll put the opponent's players under massive pressure in the middle of the fights.
Accordingly, we set up the order and prepared our players so that they could perform a real miracle tomorrow."
Thomas got the job to do the job-return efforts, and he's playing Rory McIlroy in the first game, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first half of the European team.
“I decided to add to the order, because I think that the image would work together from the beginning to the end,” Bjørn added to the individual stand.
Once again, the transfer of Germany's latest warship has been postponed
The newest fregat in the German Navy would have been to serve in 2014 to replace the ageing cold war warships, but because of various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, this is still waiting for you for at least next year.
The flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg fregats class, “Rheinland-Pfalz”, was postponed to the first half of 2019, quoted by the Die Zeit Weeklist.
According to the initial plans, the ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the ongoing delays made the fate of the large project very difficult.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships to the position of the Bréma-class age fregatts.
We are aware that it will be equipped with a large fire-powered cannon and a series of missiles and masking technologies, including a signal-resistant device that reduces the ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signs.
Another important feature is that there is a fewer need for maintenance, which in practice means that these latest fregats can be placed on service for up to two years.
However, due to the continued failure of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel overseas power, would already be lost when they were finally set up by Die Zeit, noted.
The F125 fregatt with heavy destiny was entered last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss factory in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship ship back to the manufacturer.
There is little information about the causes of return, but the German media has a number of critical "software and hardware errors" that make the warship unused in a battleship.
Software deficiencies are a very significant problem, as only 120 sailors in Baden-Württemberg class warships will serve only half of the old Brema class fregats crew.
It has also been discovered that the ship is extremely overweight, which damages its performance, and it is impossible for the Navy to make further changes later.
The 7000 tonnes “Rheinland-Pfalz” is allegedly twice as hard as the ships of similar class in the World War II by the Germans.
Apart from faulty components, the increase in the total cost of the project, including training of crews, is an increasing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the initial project was estimated at EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with new fregats are particularly important in the light of the warnings that Germany's marine presence is negligible.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the National Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recently acknowledged that the Navy “will start to run out of military ships with an acceptable status”.
According to the public official, the problem has become a self-disciplinary process in the meantime, since the old ships had to be installed, but there are no more ships to replace the landings.
He expressed concern about the fact that none of the Baden-Württemberg class fregats were able to join the Navy bond.
National Trust is searching for the secret lives of bats
A new research is taking place on a Scottish-surface estate, which aims to find out how bats are used during hunting.
Researchers hope that results can obtain new information on the behaviour of single flying mammals, which can also benefit from subsequent species protection initiatives.
The National Trust for Scotland scientists will examine the behaviour of common and sopranic fractures and brown long-blood bats and water bats in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
At the appropriate points of the area, special recording tools are placed to record the activities of bats during the year.
NHS's employees and volunteers will carry out mobile data collection with manual detectors.
Detailed analysis of the sound material of the recordings can determine the frequency of battalion sounds and what the species is doing.
Researchers also prepare a habitat map and report to determine how animal behaviour depends on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will show what are the most important habitats for bats and what species uses them.
This information helps to identify the charitable effects of living-based works, such as the construction of gaps, and how to best preserve forest areas for bats and other species concerned.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have been significantly reduced over the past centuries.
Construction and development work disturbs the sleeping areas of animals and reduces their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, as is the case with displaced fly papers, certain chemical procedures used for construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Bats aren't exactly blind.
However, because of their predators in the nights, they rely much more on their hearings when they hunt for a beast, not on their sights.
They can determine the exact situation of insects and insect objects based on their refined techniques based on the reversal of ultrasound.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, takes the question of bats very seriously.
They work with ten trained professionals, who regularly conduct studies and sleeping site tests, and sometimes participate in rescue works.
The organisation created the first and only dedicated batting reserve for Scotland on Threave Births in Dumfries and Galloway, which gives eight of the ten bats of Scotland.
According to the owner David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“ Here, Threave has a great place for bats, ” he said.
– There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is needed for a good living space.
But we don't know much about bats yet, and thanks to work here and other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel great."
He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that bats live there before buildings are renovated, as the destruction of a single establishment could result in the destruction of 400 females and young individuals, which could lead to the death of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals, their destruction, their harassment and their habitat are prohibited by the law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, also requested the help of the population.
He said: “There is still a lot we don’t know about bats, and there is almost no information on the situation of the population of most domestic species.”
Ronaldo denys rape charges, his lawyers sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo was describing accusations of sexual violence against him, and he believes that others want to use his name to “contribute to public knowledge”.
Soccer lawyers are ready to sue the German Weeklist Der Spiegel.
The Portuguese member and Juventus battler was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
The woman says the athlete paid him $375,000 to listen to the case, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo reported a fan camp of 142 million in Instagram Live a few hours after the prosecution was released that the news was "lose".
“No, no, no, no, no, and no.
What's all about me today is a lie", he told the camera about the five-time gold ball player.
“They want to use my name to get into public knowledge.
It happens.
They want to become famous with my name, that's the life of public players.
I'm a happy man, and my life is fine," he added to the player with a smile.
Because of the claims called "unacceptable, privacy suspicion" Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, says Reuters.
According to Christian Schertz’s lawyer’s statement, the player will submit a claim for compensation for “the seriousness of the moral damage caused, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The case was allegedly in June 2009 in one of the Palms Hotels and Casinos in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went up to the athletic suite where the man anally raped a woman, they are in the documents submitted to the district attorney of Nevada Clark County.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo went on his knees after the case, and said to him that he was “99 percent good boy,” with the exception of one percent.
Based on the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo acknowledged that she had sexual relations with the woman, but he believed that all this happened with a joint consent.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police, and in a hospital he also made a vision of his injuries, but later he entered an agreement outside the trial, because he was "a half of the punishment" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman would now like to repeal the agreement because the trauma caused by the case continues to detrimentate her life.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo was just before a reconciliation (from Real Madrid to the United of Manchester) and this summer the Italian giant, Juve, bought the player for EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will “behave forever” the loss of caryards
The United Kingdom will “be treated forever” if after Brexit he loses his world leader's position, said Greg Clark, Minister for Business.
He added that Toyota UK considers it "a concern" to the statement to BBC that, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, the car manufacturer will be forced to temporarily stop production at the burnastonin factory near Derby.
"There is a need for an agreement", said Clark.
According to the Japanese car manufacturing company, in the case of Brexit without an agreement, jobs may be lost due to the delays in the borders.
Last year, the toyota Auris and Avensis plant manufactured 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think that if the United Kingdom falls out of the EU at the end of March, there will be production depreciation in the factory", said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota burnastoni.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) expressed concern about the possibility of leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW stated that for one month after Brexit, Miniket's Oxford plant is closed.
Car manufacturers are most concerned that in the case of Brexit without an agreement, there are risks in relation to the supply chain.
Toyota's manufacturer's performance is on the basis of a “precision” basis, and the components arrive at 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the United Kingdom and in other EU Member States.
If the United Kingdom enters into the EU on 29 March without agreement, cross-border disturbances may lead to delays in production and lack of parts of the industry.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store enough parts for more than one day in its Derbyshire plant, so production should be stopped.
Clark said that the plan for future relations with the EU was known as Theresa May Chequers “to be elaborated precisely to avoid late controls at the border.”
“We have a need for the agreement. We want an agreement, under the best possible conditions, that we can not only enjoy the fruit of our current successes but also offer new opportunities – he said in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
– Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, can confirm that we definitely need to maintain our most successful supply chain."
Toyota could not tell how long the production would last, but warned that the cost of cogeneration could deteriorate the competitiveness of the factory in the long term, which would ultimately result in job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked 24 years in the burnastonia plant and is currently active in the representation of Unite's trade union, trade union members are increasingly concerned: "My habits say that the job will never be recovered."
One of the government speakers said: "We have developed a precision and feasible plan for future EU relations."
You can postpone Trump and Rosenstein's meeting again, announced by the White House
"You can postpone a week later" Vice-President Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump's big-time meeting, since the debate about Brett Kavanaugh's supreme candidate continues, the White House published on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian influence on elections, the relationships that might exist between Trump’s advisors and the Russian Government and the possible obstacles to Trump’s judicial service.
In Washington for months, they've been wondering if Trump will finally save the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence.
According to this monthly report by New York Times, Rosenstein considered that she would be on board for the meeting to record the discussion with the President, and the question was whether Trump could be replaced by the 25th constitutional amendment.
Rosenstein denyed the speakers.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, and the rumor was to submit his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday before the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he would not be willing to escape Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he wouldn't fight with the Senate Justice Commission hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women suspected of sexual assaults, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, also witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the final Senate vote.
Trump press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made a visit to the Fox News Sunday show.
When they asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he answered: “We don’t have a designated date, even for this week, but in the light of the cases at the Supreme Court, I see another one-week delay.
Soon we'll find out, and as always, I'll let the press know."
However, some journalists doubtfully accepted this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace was asking about this.
Sanders said that the sensation of the rareity of press conferences was not the reason for the sensational behaviour of television reporters, but added: “I am not debating the fact that it is really sensational. ”
He then pointed out that direct meetings between Trump and the press would be more frequent.
“The President gives more questions and answers to interviews than any previous president,” he added, even without supporting the claim, “We looked at the numbers.”
The press conferences will continue, said Sanders, but “If the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, light years will be better than to speak to me.
We are often trying to find this line, and in the last few weeks there have been many such occasions, so they can speak to the President of the United States personally instead of the White House press conferences."
Trump regularly responds to the reporters' questions when he leaves the White House or attends public events, possibly press conferences with the present-day dignity.
However, the alone press conferences are rare enough.
Why, it might be possible to conclude about what happened this week, when the President produced a bizarre role in New York as a law enforcement and a place to play before the gathered journalists.
The head of the health wallet contacted the EU employees of NHS Scotland on the grounds of concern about Brexit.
The head of the health wallet stated in a letter that the country was grateful to the employees of the Skócian NHS from the countries of the European Union and highlighted the hope that they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was expected to leave.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of the settled status requests for EU citizens working in decentralised public service.
In Freeman’s letter, he wrote: “In the summer, negotiations on exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued, which are expected to make a decision in autumn.
The United Kingdom Government also participated in the preparation of a scenario without any agreement.
I know what an agitating period this could be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of which country they come from.
Workers from different EU Member States and other countries will help with valuable experience and expertise the work of a health wallet that has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is entirely your home, and we really want them to stay with us."
Christion Abercrombie was under surgery after head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebackeren, Christion Abercrombie, had a surgeon surgery on Saturday after he had a head injuries at 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reported Mike Organ Tennessee.
The leader of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reported to journalists that the injury occurred shortly before midterm.
"Ki walked to the coastline and just collapsed," said Reed.
The training team and the health staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the track, then put it on the coup and took it to further investigations.
One of Tennessee State's responsibilities in Nashville in tennessee told Chris Harris, WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was beyond the surgery carried out at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Mr Harris added that “you have no further knowledge of the type and extent of the injury to date,” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old student rested for one year, spends the first season in the Tennessee State team to which Illinois has been certified.
On Saturday, he presented five successful installations before he left the field, so he's already in the season at 18:00.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for property purchased in the United Kingdom
On the basis of the new Toryk plan, foreign customers will have to pay a higher fee for the United Kingdom's purchased property, and they would support homeless persons with additional income.

The increase of the levy aims at those not taxed in the United Kingdom.
According to the State Treasury's calculations, this would amount to £120 million annual revenue, which would be used to support homeless people
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee after the property purchased in the United Kingdom, and the extra income from it will be used to support homeless people and will be prepared to announce Theresa May at a press conference today.
The objective of this action is probably to offset the successes achieved by Jeremy Corbyn in the young voters by pledging more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase in the levy will affect individuals and companies who are not taxed in the United Kingdom and will be used to combat homelessness.
The additional fee added to the current levy, which can be calculated over the higher levy on the second apartments two years ago or on the property purchased for expenditure purposes, even as a percentage of three per cent.
The State Treasury is estimated at EUR 120 million per year after the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are purchased by non-United nationals, causing significant price increases, which makes the situation of the first residents more difficult.
Many of the rich regions of the country have become “spirit city”, especially in the capital, since many foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the fees to help young people preparing to wait for their first home.
He personally holds large construction companies responsible for maintaining high property prices, which became the habit of buying and leaving the areas on parlag. He asked May to delete quotas for affordable houses and to start with a country's “screamed disgrace”.
Corbyn submitted remarkable proposals on the order of housing reforms, including housing control and the elimination of unreasonable removals.
It would also provide more powers and opportunities for the councils to build new houses.
May said: “I have said that I would like to devote my Prime Minister to the restoration of the English dream and that life would be more and more for every generation.
This should address the real estate market situation.
Britain continues, as always, open to those who want to live here, work and start a family.
However, it is not right that private individuals living outside the country as well as companies of foreign interest can buy real estate as easily as hard workers in England.
The dreams from their own home have become too unavoidable for many, and the unworthy state of homelessness has become too accessible."
Jack Ross: "I want to be the manager of the Scottish team."
Jack Ross, the Coach of Sunderland's statement that he's “primely desire” is that he can be the manager of the Scottish National Team once.
The 42-year-old Scots Coach would like to meet the challenges facing the North-East Club, which are currently in the third place of the first-class league, leaving only three points behind the first position.
Then he went to the Stadium of Light stadium after he successfully returned St. Mirren's team to the first-class football championship.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
Unfortunately, I was only able to get into the reserves – Ross said in the Scot BBC Sportsound program.
– When I was a kid, I watched a lot of Scots play in Hampden with my father, and something always pulled back to them.
Now, however, I only have the chance to succeed as a club manager."
At Sunderland's manager's position, the predecessors of Ross are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not concerned that he has to enter the prints of such big names, and he has previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
“I am assessing the success at the moment if I can get the team back to the first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, he would undoubtedly be in the first-class league.
– It won't be easy to get back, but it's more than likely that I'll only consider my activity as a success here if I can get the club back."
Ross's career in manager only started three years ago after he worked as a deputy coach at the Dumbarton team for a while and spent 15 months at the Hearts Coach Guard.
Then Aolea helped me get back to her after the team fell back to the third class, and St. Mirren and St. Mirren at the end of the fall got the championship address in the next season.
Ross claims that he's feeling much more confident now than he's ever played in his career, either Clyde or Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real determinant moment, ” recalled the time spent as coach of Alloa.
– Obviously, I thought management was more for me than being a player.
That sounds weird, because I've done it well, I've had a good time with it, actually, some really memorable moments.
But sometimes the lives of players are very hard.
There's a lot to go through every week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the work with stress and pressure, but I have my management tasks.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've tasted it, I feel the best in my skin all my adulthood."
The whole interview will be transmitted on the Radio Scotland channel from 12:00 to 13:00 on the Sportsound on Sunday 30 September, local time.
According to a study, Saturday afternoon at 5:30 the best beer falls
During the summer heat wave, the traffic of the English pubs in difficult situations has increased significantly, but the restaurant chains are still under a lot of pressure.
Based on the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, however, to restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, employee of the CGA business advisory company compiling the statistics, said: “In July the trend of the previous month, when pubs experienced an increase in revenue by 2.8%, due to the difference that a fall in restaurants could be observed even more.
In July, the reduction in the revenue of 1,8% of restaurants continued to worsen.
The most successful pubs and bars mainly betraying alcohol were those who even produced more growth than the loss of restaurants.
The pubs that offer food were more unpleasant in the long-term sunshine, although not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people prefer to drink at this time.
The revenue from the pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month and the revenue from food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst for leisure time and restaurants, says: “These results follow the trend drawn since the end of April.
Weather, as well as major Community and sport events, continue to be the main income factor in the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains are in a difficult situation and that the annual revenue reduction of 4.8% may become particularly painful due to continuous cost pressure.
It could not have been worse at a long, hot summer for restaurant operators, and it will only be time to see if the lighter weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area."
The total revenue increase in pubs and restaurants was 2.7% in July, including newly opened places, reflecting the slowing rate of the introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales of the United Kingdom’s catering sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is considered to be a broadly accepted industrial gradient, collects and analyses the performance data of an operating group of over 9 billion important total turnover of 47 members.
A child in five has social media stamps that she hides from her parents
According to a survey, a child of five (also 11 years of age) has a social media account that he hides from his parents and teachers
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of Insta websites is increasing
Fear of sharing sexual content is growing as a result of the news
20% of students responded that they had a head drawer that could be seen by their parents
Of five, a child (also 11 years of age) creates a social media account that he hides from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of Insta sheets is rising with which Instagram refers to the photo-sharing page.
The fear of sharing sexual content is growing after the news.
20% of students responded to having an unspecified “head” drawer that their parents can see, but they also create private drawers.
A mother who accidentally encountered the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teen profile on which she said, “to rape me.”
According to the research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), 40% of the 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% have recognised their own private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teens feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them,” said HMC’s leader Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of sports at the Scot Atletic Alliance
Eilidh Doyle was elected as not an executive director of the Skót Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle Scotland's best athlete, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the board, believes that the sport decision-makers will be an invaluable assistance for the wide international experience gained during the last decade.
“Eilidh is taken by enormous respect in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the international athletic community, and its presence will help the development of Scottish athletics,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I was happy to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can really help the work of Scots sports leaders.”
Two of the American athletes who regularly declared BBC as an expert in four Olympic gold coins were forced into a wheelchair at the attic at the 1996 Olympics at 200 metres and 400 metres, but because of a temporary brain circulatory disorder.
He wrote on the Twitter page: “A month ago, I got stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me if I'd come back at all for a while.
Working on people, but I've recovered completely, I can walk again, I'm going to agitation work today.
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
Breast absorptions compared to cows share the online community
A company that makes breast suckers has a strong online debate that compared breast-feeding mothers to head cuffs.
According to Elvie, he developed “the first quiet, portable breast sucker of the world”, and the appearance of their product was announced in an ironic advertising that showed the freedom the device gives to the mothers of milk.
Four real mothers are dancing in a cowhouse full of a slab, while in the background the songs of the following rows can be heard: “Yes, I am defiled, I have no dicks,” and “If it hadn’t appeared, it’s not a grain, but my breasts.”
And the refrene sounds like, "Pumpal, pump the child to eat big, pump, pump, clean the chicks."
The advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company has quickly become a crossfire of online disputes.
The video has reached 77 000 views, and hundreds of joint reception comments have been received. Many say that the advertising is a joke from the horror of the dairy industry.
“To advertise the product with very flavourless cows.
Like us, their body produces milk only if they give life to their offspring, but their calves are taken from them within days," reminds one of them.
Elvie breast-feeding can be positioned discreetly in a breast-feeding container (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment says: “Yes, it is terrible for the pet and the calf.
But why don't we use them to sell breast suckers to mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else added: “Insensitive ad.”
Others came to protect the advertising, a woman confessed that the video was "funny funny."
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd have taken it straight if I were to breast-feed.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a foolish commercial, so I'm not even trying to see it anymore.
The product is brilliant" – wrote.
Another commenter says: “This is a funny ad for mothers who are milk-driven at work or in a toilet, who feel like a ‘whore’.
"He doesn't glorify or judge the dairy."
At the end of the video, women show me that during dancing, their bras had the discreet chest sucker.
The campaign is about the feeling that women using the chest sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is quiet, does not use wires and pipes, can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding bra, so that women can move freely, hold their children in hand, or even move out during breast-feeding.
According to Ana Balarin, Mother’s co-owner and communication director: “The Elvie Pump was a revolutionary product, and it was therefore a bold, provocative advertisement.
We wanted to draw attention to the challenges that breast-feedings have faced and in a funny way to see how our chest sucker provides a sense of freedom in comparison."
Elvie's chest sucker wasn't the first time in the news.
The London Fashion Week entered the runway in the dress of a two-child mother, Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of childhood migrants were secretly transferred to a tent camp at the Texas border.
The number of child-age migrants held in custody has reached a record, while the number of monthly crossings has not changed much. This is partly explained that it is harder to find homes for them due to the harsh retoric of Trump Administration and its actions.
Particularly, the recipients themselves are illegal immigrants, and they fear that they would ruin their chances of staying in the country if they came in to accept the children.
This threat increased further in June when it was announced that parents and adults in a household should give fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, Head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Immigration and Customs Office), acknowledged in his statement before the Congress last week that several dozens of people have been arrested to receive unaccompanied minors.
The office later confirmed that 70% of the arrested were unpunished.
“80% of the applicants and their households are illegally residing in the country and a significant proportion of their convicted criminals.
Therefore, we continue looking for such individuals," said Albence.
In order to accelerate the child-related procedure, new rules have been introduced that part of them should appear before the court within one month of the arrest, instead of 60 days before the court, claim social workers.
Many people are attending the court through a video conference call rather than a personal appearance to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge fails to provide legal protection, the immigrant will be quickly removed.
Over the past few months, social workers and workers in the system have reported the longer the time they take, the more nervous and depressed children become, and the chances of violent outbreaks or escape attempts are increasing.
According to law enforcement, these risks will only be increased by a larger facility similar to its tornills, where the number of children makes it harder to filter people who need psychological care.
They added that if they don't provide enough time for the children to be prepared or say goodbye from friends before they move them into a facility like this, they make them even more traumatic.
Syria has called for immediate departure from the American, French and Turkish "invading forces"
Despite the eighth civil war in the country, Mr Walid al-Moualem, who spoke before the UN General Assembly, asked Syrian refugees to return to their country.
Moualem, a Deputy Prime Minister's position, claimed that foreign forces entered the Syrian territory, referring to the fight against terrorism, and “they will treat them like this.”
“They have to withdraw at the same time and unconditionally,” he said to the Assembly.
Moualem proved that "the war against terrorism will soon end" in Syria, where more than 360 000 have lost their lives and millions have been forced to leave their home since 2011.
He pointed out that Damascus “continued his holy battle to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and from“the illegal foreign presence”.
The US 2000 soldiers are in Syria, most of them as trainers and advisors help the Kurd Forces and the Arab militias fighting Bassar el-Assad.
France has sent over 1,000 soldiers to the country of war.
As regards refugees, Moualem argued that the conditions for their return are appropriate and that only "one Western countries" are curtailing the "irradial fears" by alarming refugees from returning home.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the people return home,” he stated.
- They made politics from a purely humanitarian question."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and its opposition on the closure of the war.
According to the UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a fight against the last great rebels around Idlib, can facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented the Syrian government forces supported by the Russians from launching a wide-ranging attack against the three-million populations.
At the same time, Moualem stressed that the agreement sets out ‘light deadlines’ and indicated its hope that military action would only be directed against the front of the al-Jamad, including the Al-Kaidan-related an-Nus, which would have to be deleted in the first place.
Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee composed of the delegations of the government and the opposition will be convened soon, with the task of preparing the Syrian constitution after the war and preparing the elections.
The participation of the Syrian government in the committee, for example, only "the revision of certain articles of the present constitution", is acceptable to Moualem's conditions and protects all external actors from interference in the process.
That's why they're gonna re-elect Trump.
Following this logic, Trump will certainly be re-elected in 2020, unless there are many liberal spectators' hopes, and there will be no end to the Presidency before a scandalous time.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic presidential final of all times.”
For now, however, the viewers enjoy the show.
Since 2014, the main programme view of the CNN has increased to 1,05 million since 2014, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its views to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million audiences in the main showtime instead of 1.7 million people four years ago, and the “The Rachel Maddow Show” runs on MSNBC is the most spectacular cable show with its 3.5 million audience, which is reached on the nights of the major news.
“We are attracted as fire, because something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the leading producer of the drama series ABC “A designated survivor”. In this series, the office is sitting in the chair of the President after the Capitol is destroyed in one attack.
Nell Scovell's veteran gambling writer, "Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different view.
This is how you quote a Boston taxi route before the 2016 election:
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why" – asked Scovell.
"Because you laughed," the driver answered.
It's the fun of chaos.
In contrast to television series, of course, the stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe vs. Wade precedens to reintegrate immigrant families and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very narrow layer can do not care about these facts.
However, it is no longer part of the responsible information when we've been staring at a debate program in which the anonymous background talks used in Bob Woodward's book "Feel" are authentic, or Paul Manafort's 15 thousand dollar struccbőr jacket (the body's arrogance dress, as the Washington Post is formulated), or the consequences of the anatomy of Stormy Daniels Trump, uhm.
What I did now will always come to mind about Super Mario.
“A little bit of a feeling that a person looks like a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, composer of the "Zalog Stars". In Trump's show, the players are constantly switching and the new turns are coming every day (such as N.F.L., begins to praise Kim Dzsongunt).
If you miss one part, you'll miss it right away.
When I reached Fleiss this week, a pleasant, 26-degree, sunshine time, Kauain, he still went inside his house looking at MSNBC while recording the CNN show.
He couldn't get away from the TV, starting with Brett Kavanaugh's hearing at the Senate Justice Committee, where the Supreme Court's future was on its own.
“I remember when we made those crazy shows, many said that this was the beginning of the end for Western civilization, ” Fleiss recalled.
- I thought they were joking, but it seems they were right."

Both parties are squeezing the money to the most important competitions in the mid-term congress.
No one was surprised that in the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania, both parties spend their money countlessly after the two active representatives fought for the same chair after the recast of Congress Districts.
One of the newly rewrited competitors in the precinct of Pittsburgh is the democrat Conor Lamb, who got a mandate in the interim election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, now represented by the Republican Keith Rothfus, the former electoral circle of Pennsylvania 12, which shows a significant overlap in the region of 17 today.
The map had to be rewritten after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January concluded that the former borders were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
In the fight against the 17th district, the two party-funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) have been almost biding for each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name was known in Pennsylvania after winning a high-interim election in the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, his seat was the Republicans, Donald Trump won the district with 20 accurate advantages.
Political experts say that the democrats have something better chances of winning.
The United States has considered sanctions against El Salvador for China's support and then withdrawn from the plan
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama were on the Beijing side that Washington barely responded to.
Donald Trump negotiated with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pulled out the Trump Organization's leader's team.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called back the heads of the American offices from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because of their ‘nearly decided that they do not support Taiwan’, Heather Nauer, the spokesman of the Ministry, announced earlier.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately USD 140 million American aid, including combating drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have affected the Central American country, where the unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As the final meetings continued, North and Central America's competent authorities postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year and the primary objective of reducing migration to the United States.
In the middle of September, high-level representatives of administration made it clear that I would like to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
They announced that Vice-President Mike Pence will also speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which, according to diplomats, is a clear indication of the importance that administration considers the event to be important.
The three American delegates returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue prosecutive statements and unapproved criminal measures.
John Bolton's white homemaker did not want to comment on the details of the debate, which the three American officials, including two diplomats, reported anonymously.
They were also supported by external analysts close to administration, who were also willing to speak anonymously.
Historical experience
The next strike may be Robert Mueller's report of a special prosecutor who examines whether Trump has in some way hindered justice.
Mueller's investigation also allegedly covers the cooperation of Trump's team with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are majority in the Congress, they are sure to try to take Trump account of who may have to face the judgement of his political partners after the votes.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain questions, and Trump's fall is far from inevitable... just as it is neither of its European competitors.
Serious decisions must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic – depending on how long the fight will go.
In 1938, many German officers were ready to defeat Hitler, waiting for the West to join the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
The support has been missed, so it has not been possible to prevent the bloodshed of the next few years.
It falls at similar historical turning points that the inevitable development of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
Today in America, we can identify several such turning points.
What are we gonna do if Trump replaces Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein in charge of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been running since last year, when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested that the talks with the President be recorded and that Trump's unsuitable office be completed.
Rosenstein said The Times reported the events inaccurately.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation initiated against Brett Kavanaugh becomes biased or unfulfilled, and is named to the Supreme Court despite a legitimate sexual harassment charge?
And the most important question is that at the interim election, we are voting for a Congress that is ready to take Trump account of?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is facing a long winter.
I trust you won't, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovak, deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that used to sit in my ambassador building.
My mother survived the holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she asked me to light candles on a table bearing the swastic mark at the time of Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans at Rangers is confident before the Rapid Vienna game
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. The victory against Austrians can ensure their participation in the Group of Europe-Liga G after the undeniable insolvency against the Spanish Villarreal.
The midwayer Graham Dorrans was unable to take a path to the 2-2 game against Villarreal in the season, but it feels that Rangers could also set more bold targets on this result.
“The important point was a great team against Villarreal, ” said 31-year-old player.
– We believed we were able to get a point, and we brought a point.
Maybe at the end of the day we could've pulled another goal, but we can't complain about the indecision.
In the first halftime, they were better, and we linked him to the second halftime.
Thursday will be another important European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy, because they were good enough on their previous game, but our cheerleaders behind our backs will have the strength to win.
Last year was pretty hard, I got hurt, there was a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
It's a good team, the boys enjoy the game, the exercises are good.
I hope that if we give it all, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results."
Many women are concerned about not saving enough for their age
Those in the survey had accurate ideas about the age of care they wanted, but only a small part of them talked about it with their family members.
According to the Nationwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected costs of their old-age care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them responded to talking to their children about it.
“Everybody wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually raise the subject,” says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Department.
The following should be done.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and your children: You can't expect them to take due care of you if you don't tell in time what your needs are.
They shall choose together with their adviser and family where and what kind of care they want; these decisions will have a significant impact on the costs of the future.
Please enter a financial advisor: he can give useful ideas on how to pay the planned care.
Financing can be done with a traditional insurance bond designed for old-age care, or a life insurance combined with a hybrid savings, which can cover expenditure, or use its own assets as collateral... if you have enough resources.
Prepare legal documentation: This will prevent the possibility of later litigation.
Trust a representative, a trustworthy person acting on behalf of you in health matters, supervise your medical care and ensure that everything happens according to your expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone with his finances.
This trusted person makes the necessary financial decisions and ensures payment of accounts when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: Suppose your old parent has been in medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer your questions about your medicines and allergies?
This information shall be recorded in writing in order to be available at any time.
“Not just financial issues, no matter who your doctor is,” Martin added.
“What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned in advance."

Earthquakes and escapers in Indonesia
At least 384 of them lost their lives when a big earthquake on Friday, and then a runaway hit the city of Palu of Indonesia. According to the authorities, the number of victims could increase further.
The network of communications in the region has also been damaged, so no news has been received from the Donggala Governance from Palu to the north, where it was the center of the 7.5 forced earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people had to be evacuated.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
The capital of the Central Celebes Province of Palu, on the west coast of the island of Celebes, was built at the end of the narrow Bay, and the estimated population was 379 800 in 2017.
It was just the 40th anniversary of the city’s founding, when the earthquake and the escaper fell upon it.
The governor of Donggala is more than 300 km long on the northwest coast of the island of Celebes.
In 2017, the population of the governor’s municipality, which was less than 299 200 people.
Mid-Celebes is mainly characterised by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is one of the important sectors of the economy, but mainly in Morowali, on the overshore of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian disaster control agency, Palut and Donggala have been injured several times in the past 100 years.
A escape price in 1938 completed more than 200 inhabitants and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, West-Donggala arrived by a fugitive, then nine died.
Indonesia is lying in the area of the naturally active Pacific Fire ring, and so there are frequent earthquakes.
Only a few of the major earthquakes and escape wings of the past years:
On 26 December 2004, a huge seaquake began on the west coast of the northern Sumatra Aceh province, which launched a fleet of 14 countries, with a total of 226 000 lives required along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of the victims lost their lives in Aceh.
2005: The Western coast of Sumatra was shaken by a row of strong wreckages between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died near the island of Nias, Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-strong vibration shaken the southern part of the island of Java, the largest population in Indonesia, and the escaper afterwards demanded almost 700 victims on the south shore.
2009: a 7.6-strong earthquake destroyed by Padang, near the capital of the West Sumattra province.
They lost more than 1100 lives.
2010: A 7.5 trembling shaken one of the islands of the Mentawa islands near Sumatra, and brought about 10 metres of escape, which destroyed dozens of villages and demanded about 300 lives.
2016: Surprising around the surface was the governor of Jaya Aceh Pidie. In many cases, panic and devastation were reminded of the memories of the terrible escaper in 2004.
This time there was no escape bar, but still more than 100 people found their deaths under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombs among tourists are popular Indonesian island; a great vibration here demanded 500 lives, especially in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings have become equal to earth, and thousands of tourists have been stuck on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
The former Governor and Vice-President of Track Palin Sarah Palin have been arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Palin lives in Wasilla, Alaska, suspecting that he was involved in domestic violence, prevented the announcement of domestic violence, and resisted the arrest, announced by the state police in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance wanted to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took her phone.
Palin is being arrested in the Mat-Su dental house, and a $500 bail on it, announced by the DPRK.

Earthquake and escaper in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 of them lost their lives after a Friday earthquake on the island of Celebes in Indonesia.
The earthquake with strength 7.5 created a fleet that destroyed thousands of residential houses.
Systems responsible for electricity supply and telecommunication have become inoperative, and the number of dead will probably increase in the next few days.
The center of the earthquake was close to Central Celebes, from the Indonesian capital to the northeast of Jakarta.
In the community media, several videos of the arrival of the escaper have been published.
On the beach of Palu, hundreds of them gathered together at a celebration, and then the ranch reached.
Federal prosecutors have requested a death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York.
New York's federal prosecutors are asking for a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, not executed since 1953.
In October, the 30-year-old Saipov drove a car from Home Depot on a bike ride on the streets of Alsó-Manhattan West Side Highway, a number of pedestrians and bikes.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov has killed eight victims ‘pleasantly’ and that he was ‘intended’ to cause injury, is in the submission of the Prosecutor's office in the south of New York.
According to the file submitted, proof of any of the two accusations may justify the death penalty.
Some weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused of 22 crimes, including eight-year blackmail murders, which were used almost exclusively against organised crime, and by the violation and destruction of motorised vehicles.
The attack was “demanded for significant planning and pre-reasoned intentions”, claimed by the prosecutors and, according to their word, Saipov carried out his actions in a way that was “scientious, cruel, inhuman. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain and loss to the family of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco” is presented.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York has been seeking a death penalty for a defendant a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to murder two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was sentenced to a life sentence.
In the New York Federal case, the last death sentence was taken in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple was sentenced two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war.
Both Rosenberg were completed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953,
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has not shown any repentance in the days and months following the attack.
During the interviews, he claimed that he was happy to do what he did.
Saipov said that the ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea of the attack are in the case.
According to the police, he asked you to put an ISIS in his hospital room.
In all 22 accusations, he confessed to himself innocent.
David Patton, one of the defendants representing Saipov, said that they were “reasonably disappointed” because of the decision of the prosecutors.
“We believe that the actual loss of freedom in life for confession would have been more favourable, and the death penalty would only extend the suffering of all the actors involved in the matter,” says Patton.
Saipov's defenders have previously asked the prosecutors not to seek a death penalty for their defense.
According to a representative of Tory, NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage stated in his demonstration at the Tory Conference that he called the people's army into battle.
According to the former leader of Ukip, politicians should feel pressure on Eurosceptics after one of Theresa May's parties assumed that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
The conservative Peter Bone, who has no office, told the participants of the Birmingham meeting that the United Kingdom would have ‘resigned’ long ago if Farage was the Minister for Brexit.
It is very characteristic of the pressure within the Mayre grieving party that Toryk of the Residency Party was spoken in another demonstration against Brexit in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers Plan, which requires permanent defection between the Brexit and the Residual Party and the EU.
According to his allies, despite the negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that the Eurosceptics and the Working Party can only choose from their package or "full chaos".
Bone in Solihull’s Leave Means Leave (the exit means we quit) said that it should be counted with the Chequers Alku.
He proposed that Farage be brought into the House of Lords and that he should be entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were to conduct the negotiations, we would have stepped out,” he announced.
The representative of Wellingborough added: “I am pleased with Brexit, but the Chequers agreement must be counted."
In criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be servants of others.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the assumption that since the 2016 vote, the public voice changed: "There is no real basis for the British people to change their opinion and to stay."
Mr Tory, Ms. Jenkyns, Ms. Brexit, also attended the meeting, said to the journalists: “I ask only: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people’s voice.
The Chequers agreement rejects the public opinion, the opposition will not vote, the political party is unpopular, and, in particular, the activists who work in the field and helped us reach the government.
Forget the Chequers thing and listen to us."
As a corner message addressed to May, he added: “Only the Prime Minister may keep his chair, who will keep his word.”
At the meeting, Farage said that politicians should “feel pressure” so that they should not betray the results of the 2016 referendum.
“The confidence between us, i.e. between our people and our politicians, is now the bet. ”
- They want to betray the Brex, and today we're gathered to fire him, and we're not going to let them do it."
These words turned to the zealous crowd: “I would like our politicians who are preparing to betray Brexit to feel pressure.
We call the people's army into battle to defeat the Brexit, and we will not rest until we make the United Kingdom again an independent, independent, proud country."
In the meantime, the residual parties roamed in Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting at the center of the city.
Some activists had developed the flag of the "Torys against Brexit" movement this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Working Party lived on the conservatives for the purpose of the party because of the security errors that occurred during the opening of the conference.
He added: “These people said that they have the IT background for an agreement between Canada and Plus, the border crossing without impenetration and the free trade agreement with Ireland without borders.
- They're just talking sidetracks.
She just doesn't have a good Brexit," she stressed.
Warren's going to "requirely consider" to go to the presidency.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, he'd carefully consider going to the presidency.

The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was a meeting with the electoral citizens in the 36th forum since the office of Trump.
A participant asked if he was planning to go to the presidential election.
Warren said in his reply, it was time for women to “be involved in the restoration of the misplaced government in Washington, including taking the highest position”.

Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton became closer to the World Championship after gaining the victory with Sebastian Vet
After Valtteri Bottas qualifies himself to a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear immediately that Mercedes' team's instructions will play a big role in my race.
Bottas, starting from the pole position, started well and almost put Hamilton in trouble because the first defended his position in two circles, which allowed them to attack his teammate.
First, he stood in the box with Vet and let Hamilton catch on the market behind the middle field, which should have proven to be decisive.
Mercedes stood up a circle later, and he came out behind Vet, but after a close operation, Hamilton came forward, during which Ferrari's pilot left the inner bowl loose after he moved twice as a defense in the third curve.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back of the traps, and it was the seventh round at the end of the first round.
After that, most of the race led, since you didn't change tyres so that you could quickly reach the target and take Kimi Räikkön off in the hope of the fourth place.
Finally, the 44th round stood in the bokszutca, but in the remaining eight circles, he couldn't increase his pace, so he became the fourth place.
“It was a day, because Valtter worked fantastic all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was ordered to let go.
The team has accomplished exceptional work to get the first two seats," said Hamilton.
Her body talk was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting because the Senator insisted that he did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter, accusing Brett Kavanaugh as a new member of the Supreme Court with sexual harassment.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the statement of Ford, which he did before the Committee on Justice of Senate, merely noted, the things in Senate prove that people are “love, hateful, and liars”.
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in Senate when they see the anger when they see people angry, believing, hateful, and liars, ” he said.
“If we look at the statements and leaks, they say, “Oh, that wasn't me.
That wasn't me.'
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Well, let's just stop for a second.
We leaked?... no, we didn't leak," he said, imitating the senator.
But Feinstein denyed that the source of leakage would have been his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims and I didn't leak his story," said Feinstein, according to The Hill's report.
"This is what he asked me to handle in confidence, and I also treated confidentially in accordance with his request."
However, it seems that his denial was not accepted by the President, who observed at the Saturday evening meeting: “I will tell you what the situation is: his personal speech was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but that was the worst word I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court accused by three women of sexual harassment that the democrats used the alleged accusations for their own purposes.
“They were willing to get the power back with any means.
You can see the infidelity, the hatred, they don't care who they're hurting, who they have to run through to gain power and control," quoted the President's words by Mediaite.

The analyst set up the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor met the defendant on Saturday at the reunion of the man who was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for hours as an expert on information analysis.
He knew with the jury how he put together the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
According to Rowlett, he received several phone locations based on the night of the woman's death with Tellis Chambers, which contradicts the man's previous claims, reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that your phone was close to Chambers when the man said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford made his statement on Saturday in which he told me that that day he wasn't in town.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that Tellis was lying because I had my truck in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
According to the cell phone data, they only met each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that following the death of Chambers Tellis deleted the woman's text messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
“He erased him from his life,” said Hale.
Defense plans to start a closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be before the jury that day.

Another black again?
New York's nanny sued me for letting a party go after a "rastic" message.
A woman in New York sued a couple of people because of their dismissal of discrimination, after a false message she sent to her, she complained that they were able to apply a black woman again.
The couple denys that they would be racists, and the case is like blackmail.
The two-children mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, disappointed when the first day of the arrival of the new childcare, Giselle Maurice, saw that she was black in 2016.
“NEE, I WILL BE ONE THINK!", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to his husband.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after he woke up on his bacteria, Plasco-Flaxman, who feels uncomfortable, fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the departing woman who was afro-American, did a bad job and was more likely to be a philipino.
Ms. Maurice got paid for her job one day and sent her home with a Uber.
Maurice now sues the party for redemption and asks for 350 bucks a day for the six-month inhabited work, for which he was originally hired, even without a contract.
“I want to show them to stop the course, and it can’t be done,” she said to Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discriminatory.”
The couple responded to racism-prosecuting claims that the elimination of Maurice was reasonable because they were afraid they could not trust him after they violated it.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t mean.
It's not racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco to the Post.
“ But would you trust your children with someone who was rude, even in a coincidence?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
Plasco, a comparison to the trial, said that her wife had only been born two months ago and that she was in a very difficult situation.
“ Would anyone attack you like this?
It's not really nice to do that," he added the investment banker.
While legal proceedings are taking place, the court of public opinion has already quickly condemned the party in the community media, harming their behaviour and logic.
According to a letter just found, Paddington's publisher was afraid that readers would not be able to connect to a speaking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said of the letter: “Let’s think of someone who first reads before publishing it.
This information is pretty entertaining now that we know what a great success in Paddington."
According to his statement, his father, who worked as the operator of the BBC before he felt inspired to write a child book about a little game bear, would not have been troubled if his work had been rejected, and then added that the 60th anniversary of the book was a bitter year after his father died last year.
Paddington was called “a very important member of their family, ” and he added, his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he had no idea at all,” he said.
“But because Paddington was almost real for him, he was like a child who brings something: we are proud of him even if it is not really our merit.
I think you've seen Paddington's success somehow.
Although he created it, and he was out of his imagination, he always made it a success to himself as Paddington's merit."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
When you landed with your daughter, you were in a hurry to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nizza, where doctors struggled in vain for her life.
“Nad regularly called to tell you, she was in a very bad condition, and they didn’t expect her to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received a call from Nad, in which he told me that my daughter would die in the next two minutes and I would have to say goodbye to him.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave him to continue to drown his heart were slowly exhausted and then left his body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to be over.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, entered the plane together with the others who did not care about the attempt she'd been through.
"No one knew", he said.
“I drove my head down, and all the time my tears blew.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all this overburdening sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew you loved my daughter very much."
Postcards with mourning women for the prevention of suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put postcards full of inspiring messages and emergency numbers on a walesi bridge.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and then committed suicide when he was 18 years old.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the same as I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that his son was a promising cook, and he's attracted everyone.
“He knew all of his smiles.
They've always said that his smile throws up any place."
However, before he died, he gave up his work because he was “in a very bad condition.”
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was found at the time of his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said: “I was very concerned that this would have a domino effect.”
Ms. David made the postcards for the purpose of “so that people can find out some who can be found and spoken to them, even if it is just a friend.
Don't sit quietly – you have to talk!"
Ms. Humphreys, who's been losing Ms. Davies' girlfriend Mark for years, who's been a partner for 15 years, not long after the death of her male's mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed or anything,” he said.
“Every day before Christmas, we have noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely under Christmas day: when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look into their eyes and like them."
He said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to process it: “He left a huge space in the family.
He broke our hearts for small pieces.
But we have to keep fighting."

Questioning Brett Kavanaugh's future as the FBI begins his investigation.
“I thought that if he was able to reach what he asked for – a limited-time investigation – we might be able to reach agreement,” Mr. Flake said, on Saturday, adding that the committee held it from falling into pieces because of the insolvency of the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and the Republican supporters oppose the FBI's investigation?
Their opposition can only be known to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans expect to fail well, it will be much harder for them to get their men to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the Senators and lobby with them for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes your report?
In the Senate, a vote is held in which 51 Republicans and 49 democrats are currently sitting.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive a minimum of 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow the Vice President Mike Pence to take a decision to put Mr. Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
The number of dissidencies in North Korea under "reduced" Kim's control
Since Kim Dzsongun took power seven years ago, the North Korean Distances in South Korea have been reduced by a South Korean Lawyer.
Park Bjengszok quoted the data of the Southern Ministry of Integration and said that last year there was 1127 dissidencies against 2011, when this number was 2706.
Park said that the closer border guard between North Korea and China and the higher punishments for smugglers were the main causes.
Phenjan did not comment on this information publicly.
The majority of the northern dissidents will eventually receive Southern Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of them escape to China, which has the longest limit to North Korea, and make it easier to cross over than the strictly protected Demilytarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
The dissidents of China are illegal immigrants, and they do not accept them as refugees, and often send them back violently.
The relationship between the North and South which is practically still in war has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenjan, at the centre of their meeting, the closed nuclear dismantling negotiations.
This historic meeting of June came between President Donald Trump and President Kim Dzsongun in Singapore, where there was a great deal of agreement on further cooperation with the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Jongho blamed the American sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the Americans, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, it is unthinkable that we unanimously disarm our weapons", Ri said in his speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a hysterical, he said he was inappropriate to the Supreme Court.
The minority president of the Parliamentary House, Nancy Pelosi, appointed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as a “hysterical” and claimed that his behavior did not correspond to the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin.
“I thought unintendedly that if a woman were to behave at any time, I would call it hysterical,” she explained Pelosi’s reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Committee on Justice of the Senate of Thursday.
Kavanaugh, he's inflicted from emotions against the celebrations that he'd sexually harass Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in their teenage age.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he shouted and his voice closed when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
In addition, he explicitly condemned the democrats of the Committee, accusations against it, called "gretesk and coordinated character murders", because of the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections, were organised by angry liberals.
Pelosi told me that Kavanaugh's behavior proved that he was inappropriate to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I believe he has excluded himself from his statements and the behaviour that the Clintons and the Democrats have proved to be against,” he said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked whether he would try to take Kavanaugh account of it, in the event that it filled the post, and if the democrats acquire the majority in the Parliament.
“All I say is that if you are not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it is not only for the Supreme Court, but not for the court where you are right now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judge's position at the Capital Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions as a democrat for the Remuneration Law or Roe v Wade, as Kavanugh is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings of Kavanaugh, he avoided the questions about whether he would copy the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“There is no time for a hysterical, biased person to be among the members of the court, and he expects us to fly away from the joy,” said Pelosi.
And women have to hold their hands.
This is a rightful explosion, an anger that has grown up for months and years, and he can't give up without crying.
“We cry when we're angry, ” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it would be so rare, do I?"
“I had a great help from a woman who worked in a leading position somewhere, ” he continued. “He told me that he was crying in his anger, but he developed a technique that, when he started crying in his anger, he said to his partner: ‘You may think I am sad because I am crying.
But I'm angry.'
And then he kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea."
Partly, they look at tears as a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the most vibrant memories of my early work, a office controlled by men, where I once started crying in my anger in the inability of crying that an older woman grabbed my neck – a cool manager I always feared – and took me to the stairs.
“You never let them see you cry, ” she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be pleased because you've been upset."
Patricia Schroeder, the then Democrat Congress representative of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an out-of-marital affair, he fell out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, he figured out that there was no reason he couldn't go for his own presidency.
“It wasn’t a well-thinked decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the competition, and the new candidates were wanted to be in the middle of their backs.
Someone named him "Snow White and Seven Snows."
Since the campaign has been a long time, Ms. Schroeder has missed the money collection, he promised not to compete unless he's picking up $2 million.
At that time, he was a defeat war.
He found out that some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“They thought that I would receive a discount?" she reconsidered.
When he held a press conference that he did not launch an official campaign, the emotions were so dissolved for thanks to the people who supported him, and for the frustration of the money collection and the system that made it hard to reach the voters directly, and for the rage of sexism, that his throat was swollen.
“They thought I had a nervous breakdown,” recalled Ms. Schroeder how the press reacted.
“They thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my tombstone.
"Blessed"?"
How is the US-China commercial war good for Beijing?
The opening line of trade war between the US and China was almost earring, and the battle has not yet ended, and the fracture between the countries can be favourable to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warnings at the beginning of the year by taxing the most important Chinese export products, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was this week, since the new duties are already affecting a product worth $200 billion, basically taxing half of the goods from China to the US.
In every case, Beijing has imposed a duty of between five and ten percent on an American product worth $60 billion.
China has admitted that every time, the second largest economy in the world will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you'd like to get Washington to back off, it would mean you'd have to give up the back of the demands, but public bowing towards the United States would be too embarrassing for Hsi Chin-ping, the President of China.
Yet, according to the experts, if Beijing is well tacticed, the US's trade war pressure can be good for China in the long term, as it reduces the dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in Washington, whether in Beijing, could create conditions that could push any of the economies of the two countries into economic rings is much more serious than the observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, research assistant for Asia, assassinated by the New American Security Branch.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, claims the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that she is ready to return to the refugee volunteers and asks for help in rebuilding the country destroyed over seven years of war.
In his speech before the United Nations Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid Moallem claimed that the state of the country is getting better.
“The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the results achieved in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which had to flee between terrorism and economic measures taken by their power, which affected their daily lives and their survival.
According to the UN's calculations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the explosion of the war in 2011.
Other six million people living in the country need humanitarian help.
Moallem said that the Syrian state would welcome all the help to rebuild the country.
However, he stressed that it was not admissible from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe has acquired the Ryder cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Couple 2018, defeating the U.S. team 16,5:10,5 in proportion to Le Gold National outside Paris.
The U.S. has now fallen in the European stage sixth time and has not won the Ryder dome in Europe since 1993.
Europe was defending its championship title, as the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn has reached the 14,5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson's American star player, who's been struggling on the whole tower, dropped his beating at the par-3 16th hole, handing this victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari shines around all over the world, so he became one of the four players who ever achieved the 5-0-0 results since the tournament started in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was removed from the lowest player in the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2 and 1 against English Ian Poulter, who may have participated in the last Ryder dome.
The eight Ryder-couple veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European winner of all time with the 25.5 career points.
“I do not usually cry, but today I couldn’t stop.
It's been a pretty tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas that he chose and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I got the cup back.
It's all about the team, and I'm happy to be able to help you," said Garcia, who's struggling with emotions, after Europe's victory.
He's handing the Stafetabot to Jon Rahm, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sundays 2 and 1 in person.
“I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this man,” said Rahm 23 years old.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now he has a 13-21-3 career record in Ryder.
It's a strange statistics from one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 addresses, and who only Jack Nicklaus precedes.
The U.S. team has been struggling all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who have golfed excellently under the whole tour.
After the disappointing result of Jim Furyk, the U.S. team captain, he said: “He is proud of these boys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we set us on fire for Europe.
We fought.
Get down in front of Thomas.
Great Captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will work together with our team, the American PGA and our Ryder Couple Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You're gonna have to raise your hats.
The opponent was better than us."
