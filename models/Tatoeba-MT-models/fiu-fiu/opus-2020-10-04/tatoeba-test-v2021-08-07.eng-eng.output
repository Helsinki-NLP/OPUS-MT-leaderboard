It's kind of a cat.
It's an exciting city, New York.
It's a pity you can't travel with us.
It's a pity you can't join us.
It's a privilege to meet you.
It's better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes.
It's clear he's at home.
It's Friday.
It's getting bigger.
It's getting dark outdoors.
It's getting dark outside.
It's good that you don't have to study so hard.

It's not Tom's idea, it's mine.
It's not very likely that Tom will want to do that.

It's not working yet.
It's not worth fixing this camera.
It's not worth going there.
It's said he knows the secret.
It's still moving.
It's Sunday.
It's surprising that they should have a second house in America.
It's time for you to go to bed.
It's too late for him.
It's too late for you.
It is true that I am a strict teacher.
It is true that the earth is round.
It's very kind of you to show me the way.
It's very practical.
It's gonna be hard to figure out what caused the problem.
It'll be done by the time you get here.
It's gonna be hard for Tom to do that.

It's gonna be impossible to do that.
It'll take not less than an hour to go there.
It looks like it's going to rain.
It looks like both Tom and Mary want to do that.
Looks like someone's ripped a page out of this book.

That makes sense.
It may not be as hard to do that as you think it will be.
It might be good to do that.
It might not be as hard to do as you think it will be.

It's 2:30.
It's a deal.
It's a beautiful day!
It's about time you got here!
It's a complete disaster.
It's a deadly poison!
It's a good thing Tom did that.
It's a good thing Tom left the door open.
It's gonna be all right.
It's always somebody's birthday.
It's a miracle!
It's a miracle that our house survived the earthquake.
It's a miracle Tom survived the accident.
It's a miracle Tom survived that accident.
It's a shame we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
It's a secret, so please don't tell anyone.
It's a shame you can't go with us.
It's become very hard for me to walk very far.
It's been ages since we last met.
It's been a while since I told you I love you.
It's decided.
It's been done before.
It's beyond me.
It's hard to love someone when it's not clear whether the other person loves you the same way.

It seems that both Tom and Mary are like classical music.
It seems Tom wants to become a teacher.
Looks like you're not having a good time here.
Looks like nobody's home.
It seems there's no one in it.
It seems to me that I've seen that person there who's wearing glasses somewhere before.
That's enough to drive you mad!
It's gonna be hard to do.
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
It's gonna be easy to find someone to rent this house.
It's gonna be hard to do that now.
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
It's good Tom hasn't done that yet.
It's hard to believe Tom's only thirteen years old.
It's hard to catch a rabbit with your bare hands.
It's hard to do that, isn't it?
It's hot.
It should have been easy to accomplish.
It's important that we do that correctly.
It's inevitable that's gonna happen.
It's just gone 20 past one.
It's marvelous.
It smells like someone's been smoking a cigar in here.
It's more than we could have hoped for.

It's not finished yet.
It won't be as hard to do as you think it will be.
It won't be easy for you to do that.

It's not worth mentioning.
It's not much worth.
It's not worth the effort.
It's not wrong.
It's not you, it's me!
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without some help.
It's obvious Tom's angry.
It's obvious Tom's not used to living on a tight budget.
It's obvious Tom's waiting for someone.
It's obvious Tom wants to do that.
It's okay to be weird.
It's okay to be mad at someone who hurts you.
It's okay to lie to the authority figures.

It's been rumored that Tom and Mary broke up.
It's surprising that you haven't heard anything from Tom.
It's surprising you haven't heard anything about what's gonna happen.
It's the kind of thing Tom would do.
It's time to reflect on your past.
It's time to wash off that funk, Tom.
It's Tom Mary wants to see.
It's Tom Mary wants to talk to.
It's Tom's thirty-eighth birthday tomorrow.
It's too bad you didn't take my advice.
It's totally dark outside.
It's unfortunate that happened.
It's unlikely Tom's gonna do that.
It's unlikely Tom's gonna do that.
It's unnecessary.
It's usually easy for Norwegians to get what the Swedish say.
It's very windy, but it's not cold.
It's a long way past the time Tom promised he'd be here.
That's what Tom would have wanted.
It's your fault I'm crippled.

It's gonna be a hot day.
It will become annoying sooner or later.
It'll be easier later.
It won't stay like that.
It won't stay this way.
It'll ruin us all.
It will hardly be any easier for people if the cudgel with which they are beaten is called the people's cudgel.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to the station by taxi.
It's not gonna be hard for us to do that.
It's not gonna be so hard to do that.
It would have been fun.

It would have been better if you hadn't gone there.
It would have been fun to do that.
It would have been hard to do that.
It would have been interesting to do that.
It would have been romantic to do that.
It would have been tired of doing that.
It would have been wise to do that.
