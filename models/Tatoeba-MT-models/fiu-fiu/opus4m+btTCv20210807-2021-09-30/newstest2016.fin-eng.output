A 9-year-old boy in Tampere was found
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday night.
A report on the disappearance of a boy from West Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and he has no danger of life and health.
The son's father told the afternoon-Sanom in the midnight known that the boy was found.
He's okay, and now we're going to start the exams.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo again - rip the painting difference to Mess
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five paints in the Spanish League on the weekend and continued his factory in the Master League.
The struggle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo on the goal of the Masters League turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the top of the scorer statistics of all time when he shot a visitor in Shahtar Donetski’s network two hits on the offences and one of the game situations.
Ronaldo raised his painting score to 80, when before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess had 77 hits in size.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has combounded in the Italian Football League in Serie A, but in the Mestarite League D block it started strongly with 2-1 guest wins from Manchester City.
The winning painting was done for ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bored the absence of a knee-wise Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend, came to the field only in the last ten minutes.
The second company of Manchester United also experienced hardships in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after 1-2 losses.
Luke Shaw's 20-year-old law enforcement officer ManU's visitor only lasts 15 minutes.
Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking sliding hit the ManU bags that attacked him so bad that Shaw probably broke the leg bone.
Shaw lay on Eindhoven's homestadium lawn for a decade of minutes before the medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests to 1-0 in 41 minutes, but the joy of ManU only lasted a few minutes.
Moreno fixed it before the break at an extra time.
In the second half, the PSV winning painting was made by Luciano Narsingh.
The Masters League of the Earth Planet began the A block of Paris Saint-Germain.
This was replaced by an Argentinian Angel Di Maria, who switched to the PSG of Manchester United shirt.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball in the back corner of Malmo's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made 2-0 for the second half of PSG.
PSG has been betten among the successors of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö is not the best possible benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a PSG starblower, first met his professional career in Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow was lost in the B-party match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately demanded a divorce - the president had the wrong speech.
Zimbabwen President Robert Mugabe had the same speech he had spoken a month ago.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has held the same speech in the House of the country again, which he said at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn’t realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe was 91-year-old in full life.
The main opposition party MDC demanded Mugabe to resign from his mission because it is too old to rule.
Assistants in Mugabe rushed to say that the confusion had happened only in the Mugabe district and that the president had not done anything wrong.
Mugaben's speech was discussed earlier and now on the influence of China on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional EU summit for the next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading to the summits, evaluates the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, government leaders should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
Negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers, according to Merkel, are included in the table of the Ministers of Interior.
Teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during an emergency call
Just a little colorful university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police that he shot his girlfriend and that police need to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "gold dog" was alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the dead woman's closest family were found on this phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and the enemy’s handwritten message: “I’m so sorry that I could cancel this loved Amy and she’s the only woman who ever loved me,” said in a letter that according to experts, Lamb signed.
Nothing suggested that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Minnesotan Cleveland's Delta State University, had already traveled about 500 kilometers to the school campus where the police believed he shot and killed the historical teacher Ethan Schmidt at the door of this office.
Lynn Buford, chief of police at Delta State University, told the university staff that he heard shooting at 10 a.m.
She said Lamb called a fateful emergency call for a while afterwards.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths increased one more: Lamb committed suicide in the police's circle of voice.
The authorities were still trying to find out Lamb’s motivation for a day after students and staff must have been hiding behind locked doors due to school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have disclosed information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher who may have had problems.
Students said they were waiting for her hours.
Prentiss's death scene, Gautier, says Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in the book he wrote, in which he thanked the “great people” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both were taught by a social science and history institution with a total of 17 staff members, and many students participated in both men’s courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
The student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student Mikel Sykes said Lamb had a lot of stress at the end of the year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for a sick leave at Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in the university’s wage principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard in advance of his doctoral value, it did not guarantee him an automatic career development and the office of the assistant professor.
University director William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, to know, but “a clear thing in Lamb’s mind was in the mind.”
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb had escaped from campus, the police got to his tracks when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas State.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-calibre gun in the backyard of a house about half a mile south of his parents' house in the suburb of Mississippi Greenville, said Methel Johnson, the death detective of Washington County.
Lamb's car was still on the yard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught the science and education science. The university has 3 500 students and is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb performed a doctoral degree in education in spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston said he was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met through friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried to teach Hairston to play a guitar for many years.
He was a pretty charming man at that time.
All the girls were melting wax when they were there, now told Hairston, a 40-year-old, who lives in Jackson's pre-town in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss have been dating for a while.
At the emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them at the river beach brick house in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told them they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends. They now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really shocked," O'Steen described his daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me she had not met Lamb, but had heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail both appeared on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together at some work.
O'Steen told me his daughter does and sings his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
A shy bar near Gautier, The Julep Room bartender and a timely entertainment systemist, Mike Shaffer, told him that he saw Lamb and Prentiss last night until September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and lips show for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
“Only a happy couple,” he said.
We were just kidding and throwing whispers to each other.
They were both pretty clever.
The dead teacher Schmidt led the first year of students’ seminar program and specialized in Indian and colonial history, told the school teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three little children.
He studied at Kansas Emporia State University and was the president of his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday evening at the Cleveland campus at Delta State campus, a candle involving approximately 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt’s wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the honeymoon, during which the choir of the university sang songs of Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Learning continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report about Mississippi's Cleveland.
The Associated Press author Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police now say that Lamb called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb was referring to his wife as Prentiss during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less workers for a holiday period
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many workers as last year, but the retailer of toys and baby products says that existing permanent and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in movements and distribution centres across the country, with 45 000 wages paid during the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said the interviews of applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help occupy shops and sell, shipping and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "treatment" with Princess Diana
Back to the future film was a professionally important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royals, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," he said, the future documentary on Back in Time trailer.
The movie starts and I think that I am just a stretch and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary of the Return to the Future film interviewed by Foxi, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and CEO Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future was first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's no doubt the finest time travel movie of all time."
Back in Time is available in order videos, DVDs and some movie theatres in October.
The United Nations Director says the situation in Syria is not armed.
The reply of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that Russia will increase military support to Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict is "not solved in a weapon" and the additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Director again urged all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to combine and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At the Wednesday press conference, Ban told me that he would meet the foreign ministers of five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during the General Assembly Minister Week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces "is impossible to resolve the situation."
Ban urged five permanent Member States to demonstrate solidarity and unanimity in dealing with the Syrian crisis when concluding the Iranian nuclear programme.
8 support surveys that show that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him as wind virus.
Others just think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to slow Donald Trump off the top of the support surveys, it has not succeeded.
From the last 11 national surveys, Donald Trump has been in charge of the tenth century, and some have started to consider seriously what this means for the appointment of the real estate king.
The electoral season is only in the beginning.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a candidate for Republicans.
The commentators pointed out that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing his leadership to a risen Herman Cain, both of which did not receive any state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he has problems in general elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bush Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organization for Growth, have noted Trump’s silence and have started to use its funds to cover him.
The following recent support survey results suggest that the property king is not just a transient phase:
Trump's popularity figures have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, Monmouth University's support surveys showed that only two Republicans from 10 were welcome to the king of real estate.
By mid July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About 3 out of 10 says they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first election states.
Last week, 60% of the Republicans in Iowa, the Quinn Market University, said that they would welcome Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67% of Republicans said they would either be "inspired" or "happy" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two in ten said they would be "ashamed" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson makes most of the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% "inspired" vs. Trump).
Next, the most inspiring?
Marco Rubio only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters would be "happy" or "hard" if the most popular Jeb Bush would be a candidate for the rulers.
The nature of Trump's fire is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised for his magnificent speeches and insults, the ABC News/Washington Post survey suggests that 52% of the voters on the Republicans’ side of the Republicans at national level think that the real estate king has the right quality of character for the president.
According to Quinn’s last week survey in the Iowa state of the first party meeting, 52% of the Republicans think that Trump has the right quality of character for the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, 44 per cent thinks that his nature does not apply to the president, and almost six of ten thinks that his nature is not part of the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real alternative.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four of 10 people considered Trump as the most likely option when asking who is most likely to be appointed as a candidate for Republicans.
At the end of July, 4 out of 10 supported Jeb Bush.
Publication of information: The voters of the Republican Party have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball.
During the last election period, four of the ten Republicans considered Rick Perry to be nominated, and only 28 per cent of the final candidate Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most voters in the Republican Party consider Trump's campaign to be credible.
Even though the Republicans would be in favour of another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the slice field is likely to have promoted Trump’s leadership, as Trump’s support has been divided among many other candidates.
However, the survey conducted by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives the majority of support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie at 33 points.
He's at a plane with Ted Cruz.
Trump's only winning candidate?
If they were placed against them, Ben Carson would win businessman Trump's big 18-point difference.
Just and just a majority of Donald Trump's supporters have said they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a bit more than half of the voters in favour of Trump have decided who their vote goes.
The situation can naturally change, and no one can say completely certain that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent said they might be able to change the candidate.
In any case, Trump’s biggest competitor is currently another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who said they made a decision are twice more likely on Trump’s side.
Six of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "raiser" in his campaign speech, immigration has been in the mid-2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s ability to drive Latin voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding companies.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems as long as immigration is at the heart of things, it is also Donald Trump.
The frustration of the government has reached a new summit.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of the Republican voters, due to their role outside politics.
Six of the ten Republicans said on Monday in the ABC/Post survey that they would prefer to choose a non-political person rather than someone with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey from Iowa showed that three of the four Republicans of Iowa have been frustrated by Republicans in Congress: 54% are "unhappy" and 21% are "hardly angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first interview at the Prime Minister's Question Hour
Corbyn’s first interview in the query hour has been eagerly expected since his choice
The new leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corby meets David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's Question Hour.
Corbyn rises to ask about his first six questions a little after the half day, and most likely both media and the Labour Party’s representatives are watching carefully his performance.
Corby has requested this weekly show to be "a lesser theatre and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the occasions to take care of his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke to the Central Organisation of Professional Associations on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to stand quietly during the national song during Tuesday’s Memorial Service, held on the 75th anniversary of the British World War, has raised a review of the Conservative Party’s referendums and appeared on several front page cases.
Corbyn’s decision not to sing a national song has attracted attention
Corbyn’s representative said, “Standing in Honestly,” and that he recognizes the bravery of the Royal Air Forces in the British Air War.”
Corbyn’s shadow government member, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he would have called the Head of the Workers’ Party to sing a national song, despite his opinion that the king’s room should be suspended.
Nearly ten of the shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn’s interior, appealing to disputes in economic, defence and external matters, and initially, less than sixth of the Parliament’s party supported him as a leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the lineusers concerning the position of the party in the European Union and the government’s ceiling of support have “fall” even within the Labour Party after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at the meeting of the Central Organisation of Professional Associations that the Labour Party would present a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, work and pension secretary Smith of the shadow government said that the party was “exceptible” in relation to the fact that they only oppose the government’s plans to calculate the ceiling from 26 000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn becomes the fifth leader of the working party David Cameron has met during the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Head of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now tells him that he has "compressed" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Corbyn, the Popular Representative of Islington North, has said that the nature of the prime minister's survey hours is too contradictory and that he intends to refrain from both clever wording and whilst ploting, instead, to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the economic secretary of the shadow government, is in his position in survey hours when Corby is not involved, for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also suggested that other colleagues may sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the chairman of the subroom, John Bercowi, from the teams of the matter.
When Cameron got in charge of 2005, he said he wanted to move far away from a political theatre that often combines the Prime Minister's interviews, but later he had to admit he failed.
Since they started television in 1990, the Prime Minister’s Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the ability of the leader, his sub-room management, and his position with other representatives, even though the critics have criticised the questioning lessons that they have become just a grievous, requiring far-reaching reforms.
Described in Joburg: Homeless Young People are trained as photographers

The value of the pound rises as the UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers appeared to increase in the UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose up with SABMiller.
During May-July, the UK wages, including bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same time in the past year.
The growth rate was the fastest after 2009, and it was considered to be accompanied by estimates of the increase in courses.
The pound rose over a percentage of USD 1,5505 and 0.84 per euros to EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most dividended share of the market and rose by 20% after the competitor AB InBev approached it with the offer.
The treaty would combine two of the world’s largest brewery and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share grew by 0.9% after the competing luxury group of Richmont was given encouraging news.
Richemont’s latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry’s key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore’s shares increased by 5 per cent after the mining waste reported that it had collected $2.5 billion by dropping stocks as part of its debt cutting strategy.
Packaging and paper group Mond’s shares were the biggest indices of the index by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendations from the company to the "sale".
JD Sports increased by 3.1 per cent after the sports clothing company announced its output of six months before taxes: 83 per cent increase to 46.6 million pounds.
According to the JD Sports Director, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, CEO of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wages for employees are raised in the UK, it may mean that "the buying power of potential consumers will increase".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs might be targeted by the company’s enlargement plans, he added, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash starts a grass root campaign against the invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA trades from Aldi's attack in South and Western Australia.
Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and Western Australia before the attack of $700 million.
Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first trade in South and West Australia, which are coming to up to 120 trades. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food brokers and build the IGA brand through the marketing of power flow and social media, and through the exhibition of events such as Adelaide show.
The IGA traders and buyers have jumped in, and brands such as the Dunsborough ice cream manufacturer Simmo's offer tastes in the IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets for Australian football matches to their stock customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesale of food, alcohol and iron goods organises the strategy date of annual investors.
There is a lot in the game, since South and Western Australia represents nearly 30% of the IGA trade area of Metcashi and has higher profit margins than the IGA network of the Eastern States of Metcashi.
In the purchases of South and Western Australia, visitors are well known to be corners, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the West compared to 14% in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi catches about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first movements.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash can lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up 30 movements in the south of 25 and west next year, producing $500 and $600 million turnover in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and amounts in Metcashi’s high fixed costs can cost Metcash about 13 million dollars of business losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in eastern states, mainly to Ald and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA’s customers were most loyal to all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi’s food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Investment Fund and the founder of the Magella Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said at a business lunch in Melbourne, that Metcash could “probably lose in a decade”.
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcashi Government would have contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of the IGA has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010 and revenues from Metcashi’s food and food business, which transmits products to around 1200 IGA resellers, have fallen by 43% after 2012. This indicates the reduction of the debt financing of operations when the pressures on sales and margins are concerned.
However, the wholesale keeps its sides and has invested over 150 million dollars per year when the price of hundreds of products falls per week to the same level with Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA traders to rebuild shops by increasing faster fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brand products on the market.
Metcashi’s CEO Ian Morrice says that price calculation and the improvement of shops have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesale will return to the road of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Union, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thaanis Kokkinakis deserves more respect than criticism about his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis had to suffer as a side-by-side in a recent storm that has flourished around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more respect than criticism about his own behavior, says Steve Healy, President of the Australian tennis union.
The youngest member of the talented twin called "Special Ks", Kokkinakis, unwillingly, became public about the case where Kyrgios irritated Stan Wawrink at the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly after that, in the fierce fight at Cincinnat, the chief judge had to separate Cockmans and his opponent Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared, "Wawrinkan should have beaten by Kyrgios, and I should beat that kid."
Even though the last one was seen to break down his mail after the cramp ruined his potential victory from Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been an unstable defender of the cooks.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth from the second place in two games with Bernard Tomic in Davis Cupin's semifinal against Britain.
“I am quite strongly in the opinion that Thanasi is just pulled into the blast,” Healy said.
He broke his mail when he lost a cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mail when he frustrated, and I feel Thanas very well to know that he's not proud of it.
But he has acted greatly, including quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around, he's got a great family around, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is very mature at the age of 19, he works hard, fits in the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he exercises firmly, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be evaluated according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take part in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution to all, but still supporting the return of Canberra to the team's stabilization.
“We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not everything around the polemique [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in the public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all his criticism. However, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it is best for both the team and for him if he spends some time away from the public to consider these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared the state of exception and closed its southern borders against Serbia, arresting those who attempted to enter the country illegally. The aim is to pave the flow of migrants coming into the country.
At the border, chaos followed when hundreds of migrants were gathered in a neutral area, and Serbian authorities react with a disastrous reaction.
People who escaped violence in their home countries have now set up their tent and set up an unspecified time between the inspection stations in two countries.
However, the frustration grew.
When the police helicopter stayed above them, immigrants hovered "Open the border!" and screamed offensives to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is “unacceptable” to return migrants from Hungary when more and more enters from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause damage to civilians.
The debate will take place next few days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion between Hungary and Serbia was born after the 28 nationality group failed in the creation of a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for 40,000 people applying for asylum, who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers wished to reach the final agreement - by the end of the next month or by the end of the next year - of which EU countries take 120,000 extra refugees, including some of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demand an additional EU summit next week on Tuesday, discussing the migration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will function in the near future.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum matters to be accelerated.
At the same time, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the aid on the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up its borders against Romania to stop the flood of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were recruited to finish the wireless garden between Hungary and Serbia.
During recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and arrival place for refugees in the European Union, many of which are in war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life, and not those who are eligible for protection under the war - this view is strongly inconsistent with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary in midnight, now define a crime attempt to exceed or damage a 4-metre (13 feet) wireless fence built by the government on the southern border against Serbia, and include further prison penalties for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declares an emergency," Zoltan Kovacs, announced to journalists in the south of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament must continue to formally accept the position of the warfare expected for the next week, but Associated Press’s journalists at the border have seen heavy-armed military staff with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban’s National Security Advisor Gyorgy Bakondi said that the authorities had captured 45 people when attempting to cross the border and 15 more advanced countries.
They got over by hurting the fence, are now arrested by the police, and are accused of breaking the new laws.
The authorities will quickly fix the fence.
The Hungarian officials also closed two seven crossings from the Serbian borders on Tuesday morning after they had sent a wireless train to close one of these places.
The main border crossing place near Roszkke was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in the metal container for human treatment and the crowds caught the inside.
About 20 heads in, but thousands left out.
One group of immigrants blocked the main motorways between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 elections: According to the National Survey, Hillary Clinton’s leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed side
Former foreign minister Hillary Clinton continues in two-digit leadership in the democrats nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders captures him.
Clinton now supports 47% of democratic voters (calculated by 58%) and the second Sanders supports 27% (up to 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to the presidential race, but he supports 15% of the democratic voters.
More than five months before the beginning of the election, the majority of the democratic voters find that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote.
However, Clinton’s supporters stand behind their own choices more stringent than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has decreased in several population groups since last month’s CBS News Poll survey, while Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity with men has decreased significantly, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton has lost the advantage of the democratic voters under the age of 50, and he is now at a level with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in the double-digit century with liberals, but now Sanders leads this group with five percentage units.
Approximately half of the democrats in the country say they are eager to support Clinton if he becomes a candidate for the party.
Fourth says he supports him with certain reservations, and 15 percent would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be enthusiastic to support him.
Consciousness is more confused with those who are currently not in favour of Clinton - only a quarter would be eager to support him.
In which 48% of the voters of the Democrats say that they would intensively support Clinton, one of the Republicans, Donald Trump, says the same thing as the lesser Republican voter (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters were asked why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had a suitable experience (16%). Then the most popular answers were that now is the time for the female presidency (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility to be elected were also mentioned.
Since the Vice-President affects the possible presidential candidate, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even if the third disagrees.
When asking democrats who they would choose for the second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue a candidate for Democrats, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will grow. If Biden leaves, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves out, the number will be 30.
55% of the democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance to win the presidential elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this measure, Biden stays far away, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most voted has grown.
However, when the democratic voters were asked, what is the most important thing in the candidate, they raised opinions prior to voting.
Even last month no democratic candidate or possible candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates will be able to deal with certain key issues among the voters of their party.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, trustworthy and strong leaders.
Biden is the best of three in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
30% of the democrats say that Clinton is not honest and reliable, which is twice more than Sanders (15%), but 27% say that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democrat voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When we look at all these issues, about a quarter of the democrats say they have no opinion about Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton’s personal e-mail address and server use as a foreign minister still raises questions, most of the democrats are pleased with his explanation of the matter and say that the matter did not affect their consensus on him.
However, it is different when we consider America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about a third of them are satisfied.
The opinions of the people were distributed in March shortly after the daylight.
Most Americans say that the e-mail polism did not affect their overall opinion on Clinton, although 36% say that their opinion on Clinton has deteriorated.
More than six of ten Republicans say their opinion on Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton’s own party voters consider him honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32% think him honest and trustworthy, and this figure has dropped 8 percentage points of last month and 15 percentage points after May.
62% of registered voters say Clinton is not regarded as honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of the voters registered across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trumpia are considered well leaders.
Six of the candidates Biden, Carson and Bush involved in the study are considered to be more honest.
Sanders are generally considered honest, but many have no opinion about him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in the study involved in 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national survey
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
In the new survey, two candidates gathered half of all votes, leaving others to fight for the footside.
The Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen to the previous survey of the CBS from 23% on Tuesday to 27% in the last month's Fox News electoral debate.
At the same time, Carson increased from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with various demographic groups and is extinguishing among Trump’s highly trained Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left since, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. The support of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has fallen most: from 10 percent last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Floridan Senator Marco Rubio, are at the level of 6%.
The error margin of this latest survey in September is +/-6% in the sample of 376 Republican voters.
Last week’s CNN/ORC survey showed Carson’s rise in the surveys: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is 32% ahead of him.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
Trump criticized the retired neurosurgery, while Carso apologized for the question of Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday at his campaign visit in Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are accused of the death of the first year of Baruch College student
Nearly two years after the student died in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains, the murder charge has been raised against five people.
At the Baruch College in New York City, members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood were cruelly attacked by Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and afterwards delayed his release to the hospital, thereby contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with more than 13 kilograms of sand full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tampered on the ground when he tried to walk through the ice field towards the goal.
In the end, Deng complained that he was going to hurt his head, after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng was fainted, but the accusations said they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, to search for information on his symptoms on the network, and to contact the National Chairman of the Brotherhood, Andy Meng, asking for this advice, police chief Chris Wagner told the press conference.
“This is where the members began to hide their ritual equipment, and therefore practically put the welfare of the brotherhood in front of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
Deng was not refreshed, and he died the next morning.
According to the report on the opening of the body, Deng received repeated dull object attacks on the head, body and thigh.
“There are too many families who have suffered a brotherhood immersion every year when at least one student has died since 1970,” Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, said in his opinion.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this is an important step of the authorities.
The grand jury of the Monroe County supported that the first five members were charged with a third-degree murder.
32 other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also accused of violent simplication and criminal conspiracy.
“We don’t want to be accountable only for individuals. If there is an organization that officially or unofficially accepted the situation, they should also be accountable,” Wagner said on Tuesday at the press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood from the local department.
This happens when the US Central Bank raises interest rates
The rise in interest rates will come, and the market in rising courses will fall, the profits of bonds will rise and the economy will have to decline.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will take or how long it will take.
The past does not provide much help with timing, which comes specifically to the economy.
The return has lasted only 11 months after the first lift, and sometimes it has been as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Central Bank's interest rate increase has often been a factor, although not always, in determining how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why the US Central Bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on it as interest rates are being raised, but mainly on the development cycle of the time of normalisation.
There are a number of variables in the equation.
In the end, however, the market participants can find that all interest rates have been exceeded.
"The first increase in the global economic crisis of the Central Bank will inevitably be interpreted in some circles to end the age of "loss of money"," said Capital Economics, the main economic experts in global matters, Julian Jessop, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest rates to the normal, even though still low, to the level is a revolutionary shock that many seem to be afraid.
However, this does not mean that it has no effect.
Below is an overview of how some economic sectors will react on the basis of previous developments:
As has been seen in the market over the last month, the expectation of the increase in interest can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not so dramatic.
“It seems that capital yield has a tendency to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the increase of the central bank.
In particular, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, around 14% increases when it is approaching, 250 days afterwards, the situation is fairly steady (a average increase of 2.6%), and the normal state has been achieved after 500 days in the average output of 14.4% in the last six cycles, the Nuveen Asset Management company’s leading capitalistrate Bob Doll’s fresh analysis published in Barron’s magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer at the later stage of the increase cycle when revenues begin to fall.
Returns are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not previously been faced and which can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly a gross national product which will be closest to its lowest level of all time before the central bank increases.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal GDP of 118 increases since 1950 has only been less than 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few believe it will remain after the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta says.
The increase in interest rates in this fragile economic regulation may be risky and raise the question of "is this time different", Deutsche Bank said.
The market participants are reserved for the increase of the central bank throughout the year and all are waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which will end on Thursday.
While many strategics and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, the future trade expects only 25% of the probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950, all the increase cycles have been present in the supercycles of increasing fluctuation, where GDP has passed its tops very quickly before the recession," the report says.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession that has been the worst in the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has expected the most far from the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is already on the 74th month.
The fixed return has also been unstable when the market expects to increase, and the model resembles some of the findings made on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects will appear faster in bonds than in shares.
The trends in the incomes of debts appear to change immediately in the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the redemption cycle, the return on debt books will drop immediately,” Deutche Bank said.
The Charles Schwab Strates believe that the increase in interest rates leads to the convergence of the yields of longer and short-term debts, thus at a level of return.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although “we are still careful about looking for profits,” Schwab’s solid output analyst Kathy Jones said in an analysis.
It is surprisingly surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the ECB's policy expectations.
"In addition to the decline of the strength and inflation expectations, there are several signs that markets have adapted to the prospects of stricter monetary policy," he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are high, the return curve is more uniform, the credit margins have increased and the instability has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its line.
In general, companies whose business is mostly located in the United States win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt are doing worse when the price increase of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debts become more expensive than they have to finance.
"History shows that "quality" shares are generally more profitable in the three months after the first interest rate," Goldman Sachs analysts said in their report.
Companies with strong net sales overlooked poor turnover after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average by five percentage units.
Companies with high capital return and low volatile shares were better than low-quality companies. Firstly, the average was 4 (percent) and the latter 3 (percent).
The debt will be a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of exchange rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
In addition to trading, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Saviours can also gain profit with higher profits, even though experts disagree on how fast the impact feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, Popular Representative Andrew Bingham says
Conservative Chairman Andrew Bingham is accusing the channel of "nationalism"
He claims that its separation from a commercial competitor becomes increasingly difficult.
In addition, he took the BBC Music Awards, saying that they were just imitating the British Awards Awards
Damien Collins criticizes The Voice, saying that it is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is becoming Classic FM, claiming the leading representative of the production company's pressure to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
Conservative Chairman Andrew Bingham also said to the leaders of BBC that the public service radio channel seemed to "nationalize" its content, and it is increasingly difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor.
"I don't want to use Radio 3 to become a Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards Prize, which was launched last December.
“The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appears only from the British Awards, organized under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples that I have just remembered when you actually just copied something that already exists on the market," Bingham said.
BBC’s Director-General denied the charges claiming that BBC Radio 3 is a lot ahead of his commercial competitor as it comes to live music and sharing information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can’t learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-class.
"I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel needs to work more than before to reach the public, because the British know less about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only part of BBC’s supply, criticized by the entry toes of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, the Conservative Tory Party, criticized The Voice, the music competition that BBC purchased from the Dutch production company Talpa Media, estimated at 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not self-made?
Lord Hall argued that this BBC1 channel program, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George acted as Star Judges, was produced in the "particularly BBC style".
He added that he wanted the production company to “recover success within his own house” the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent the production of future The Voice seasons, or to determine that the money of the authors would be used for other forms of entertainment.
Online sales rose so far in August, Black Friday may be a reason
Online sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
The increase last month was after the beginning of low statistics in 2000.
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday may reduce consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade and has transformed many of the British shopping skates into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are signs of a level of online sales in the air when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
The total consumption of August grew at least after the beginning of statistics in 2000: only five percent increases in the last year.
Experts say there are signs of a level of online sales in the air when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels of the previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rationalized over time," Andy Mulcahy, the supplier of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones for shopping.
It meant that more people made purchases online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it is leveled, and (growth) can count.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been considered one of the reasons behind slowing shops.
Experts believe that consumers will curb the purchases before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times more buyers ran into their computers to pick up shops, pouring down many traders' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which allowed buyers to argue about findings, can hinder shopping
The British Retail Consortium published a study found that only 1 pound of five were used online.
For certain products such as television and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made from online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using shopping fashion chains.
Muslims bury the deaths of the Meka lifting custody, Bin Laden's family
The Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first funerals in Meka
Saudi Arabia is partly accused of the collapse of the building waste Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured when the lifter fell down
29 dead were carried in the air through the streets, when hundreds of Muslims were gathered to bury them, and the victims died when the lifter collapsed in the great mosque of Meka.
In the main proceedings, white-dressed mourners filled the route to respect the first dead who made their last journey to the funeral land of Al-Moaissem.
The tragic journey passed out of the holy place, where only a few days ago the lifter fell through the mosque roof and shrinked the worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden’s family’s construction group to be guilty of a disaster where 394 people were also injured.
29 bodies were portrayed through the streets of those who killed the lifters in the meka's great mosque
Among the dead, the father of four children was Qasim Akram from Bolton from Manchester, and he was the first pilgrim to fall.
Akram had been in a big mosquito with his parents before the beginning of the year’s hairy holiday.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the shark of Meka continues when thousands are constantly entering the city.
Today, King Salman said that Binlad's Group should not have left up the nozzle when it wasn't in use.
The Arabic version of the decision published by the Saudi Press Agency, led by the State, stated that Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The service of the news agency in English did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s leaders were banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salma swore that she would find out what caused the fall of the lifts in the yard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had been gathered before later on this month.
Binladin Group has not published any communications on the collapse of misery and its representatives have not been captured for commenting.
The Royal Decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are tens of lifts around the mechanic major mosque, which are part of a huge building robbery led by Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruler family for decades, leading to large construction projects.
Al-Qaida’s executive director, Osama bin Laden, was a rebel boy, whose family banned him in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in the windy and rainy weather only days before millions of people arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrim that each able Muslim should do at least once in their lives.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials to pay for the dead and permanently injured.
The other injured will get half of this amount.
Boss B&Q says that the workers working cheaply in Eastern Europe are behind popularity
Brits use more and more assistant services, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
The result of Screwfix trades aimed at professionals is 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, the main letter exchanger of the city for Daily Mail
The British say they give up their hammers and paint pencils, and they prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do homework
Looks like if you're a smart hammer or you're painting the walls, you're now in a minority.
You see, the British are hiring more and more assistants to take care of tea-se-se-work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
The new president Veronique Laury, who owns the home renovation chain, said that the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe are behind popularity and that they offer their services at a price of ridicule.
This leads to the fact that Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix trades for employees and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight of the purchase decisions made in ten stores are specifically made by more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population need to be taken into account: today there are more economies of one woman in which more homework are done than before.
Laury said, “The majority of our store staff are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is only one of the five women who lead the most important companies of the UK FTSE100 index. He has rebuilt his leadership group in such a way as many men and female men.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with 50 percent of women, including its Director-General and the Financial Director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - the difference here is important.
It’s not hard to find good women in the management group.”
Kingfisher announced the bill in both six months of production and sales after the group took the cost of closing shops.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher owned by Screwfix and B&Q stores is opening 200 new movements
The government of three aces decided to rely on mandatory legislation to save the economy of the country.
The visible effects were quite rapidly achieved.
The sharp head of the SAK and other wageholder centre organisations began to force the country to stand on Friday due to a broad demonstration of workers.
A lot of people also think that there is sense.
Let's ask if it's worth strikes when it's going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people on the internet have already been reporting that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, but going to work.
In the old good time of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but it would have been a political suicide for a small person to be declared a wealthy.
Millions of professional organisations are not much delayed by the protest of a few ten thousand people, but the subject of thinking is given.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it has been twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government’s brutal solutions can also be seen as a direct gift to heaven.
When things have appeared to be rolling on their own weight for years, now the unions finally get involved, i.e. the rights of the employee to defend, be visible and properly.
Thus, the government may want to imprison the role of the ay movement, when membership in the union may be seen more necessary than before.
We have any opinions about the activities of the organizations, so it is nuts that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has declined 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
These things would force everyone's head.
Hard savings for the University of Lappeenranta: A target of 8.5 million savings, staff reduction by 130
The University of Lappeenranta starts a savings course with a view to getting costs reduced by EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings of the university, the general public negotiations on the entire staff will be launched, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means reducing around 130 employees.
In addition, two million other activities are aimed at saving.
The budget for 2016 is based on the YT negotiations, which is expected to be 8.5 million in deficit.
It is also affected by the budget cuts made by the government.
During this financial year, the university makes about 2.6 million deficits.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time, the funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between massive teaching and research cuts and the reduction of corporate funding in our university is very important, says director Anneli Pauli at the University.
Before the summer, the impacts of the surgery appeared even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with trustees will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last six weeks prescribed by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants the Finnish railroads
The owner of Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in travelling to Finland.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail transport companies in Britain, Souter says.
Rail transport is expected to be open to competition gradually.
The first is the near transport of the capital area between 2017 and 2018.
After the nearest traffic, there is far-reaching traffic.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport is welcome to the plans of Onnibus.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has announced its interest in rail transport in other international companies, which also has bus traffic in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
The U.S. Central Bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows from the page when the U.S. central bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
When Reuters asked 80 economic scientists a little more than half of those who believed that the central bank would raise interest rates last week, they now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates are kept at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historical event, because when the central bank cut interest rates at zero, it is seven years old.
For the first time, we are approaching the situation where the central central bank has the opportunity to get off the zero level and start normalising the interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institue for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well and recovery has brought billions of dollars into balance and created a little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rose global prospects.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for lifting, but the signs also show that they believe that the probability is against increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20.00 (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting his colleague later on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "pity" about the first murder and hoped that he could revoke it on Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier's police told me that Delta State University's National Knowledge and Social Sciences teacher Lamb called the emergency number at about 10 a.m.
Monday and told me he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said, "He killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "blown dog in the house," which was "no disturbing anyone", but probably shocked.
The police asked the caller the name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give me an explanation for shooting.
When the police arrived, there was a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss's body and a 45-year-old Lamb's message in which he read, "I'm so sorry that I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed historic teacher Ethan Schmidt, before he eventually killed himself late on Monday when he was surrounded by a police officer.
University director William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, to know, but “a clear thing in Lamb’s mind was in the mind.”
On Tuesday, the authorities said that despite the claims published on Monday that Lamb had believed that Prentiss was in relation to Schmidt, there was no "legislation or evidence" of any kind of "Colmiumodrama".
Shawn O'Steen told me she was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as "good man".
A couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was "ashamed".
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were “the best friends of all.”
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online at home. According to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“He always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
The police told them that Lamb called his relatives somewhere on Mondays to tell them that "he's not going to prison."
When the police reached Lamb's highway 1 near Greenville later the same night, Lamb stopped his car by the side of the road, left it there and went to the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education science Delta States in spring 2015, says a list of records found on the University’s website.
Stars who lost their charming power
The actress (right), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been hard in recent years.
In 2001 he suffered leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to the rumors, he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
Everything like this really requires its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw got a double break in his right leg when Manchester United was defeated by PSV Eindhoven in the Masters League.
Even though the defender stays tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play this season.
Hector Moreno's injured him in 15 minutes after Shaw had fallen into the PSV area.
He was treated 9 minutes on the field and had to be given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture in his leg and he's now in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day after that, and then cut in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties, and then plays greatly, and now that's what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, she had an oxygen mask on her head.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he doesn't play in the block phase.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he received a red card and a punishment shot.
Mr. Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian activist was wrong.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a punishment shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot bucket.
Shaw twittad as follows: “Thank you for all your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger.”
Subject: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw’s case and loses to PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive for recovery in the next June European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out of this kind of injury, all of them are very sad.
Our players are never meant to hurt the opponent.
Morenon's foot broke when he played in the Mexican team against Van Gaali in the 2014 MM.
“Moreno takes this hardly because it’s not intended to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it’s a bad thing,” Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I did was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed like he had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's fight.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible for this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than that, right?
Each parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it will not last long until it is almost out.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the service providing children’s holiday care asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children’s book, he chose Dr. Seuss’s The Lorax, the environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps company’s website and continues: “Happy, moving, creative, and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book for my children, because it always seems to have a picture or message that we haven’t seen before.”
All this is true, but the following paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version where new characters and details were added to filling a fairly short original text.
"In the city of Tarville, where all nature has lost and even the air is traded, Ted's son hopes to win his dreams on his side by filling Audrey's desire to see the right tree," the text says and describes the love story, which Dr. Seuss, died in 1991, was not written by Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this is not yet suspicious, Cameron’s text sounds like it was taken from the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins as follows: “Indoor Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is traded, Ted’s son hopes to win their dreams on the side of the heart of Audrey’s girl.”
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so inexpensive that the book was drunk. In that young, anonymous son hears how local nature has destroyed the greed, wooden beating and needles, without giving the story of the short, delicate creature of Lorax, who "pures for trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read the book for 20 times a child.
The prime minister said the text must have come from the office of the Cameron Election District.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on it at the moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of staying behind the British team, but it was still a hard place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a hard task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for a tour, I don’t think the recurrence of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't close a guest win out of the bills.
Alastair Cook’s half may be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it includes good spinners and the team’s thinking method is strong: they do not have scars from 2012, just a young positiveness.
Moeen Ali develops in her spinning and Adil Rashid is an attacker, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth fell from the English Cricket team, he becomes Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth on the team must be understandably difficult to analyse for me because I am his principal coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been in challenging circumstances against good attackers, and the simple but cruel truth is that cricket players are criticized on the basis of their results.
For example, the choice of Joe Root had no uncertainty before the announcement, because, as I have said before, the players are the best factors for the choice.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, another chance will come forward.
England’s chief coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when he did not perform as well as he could, and it doesn’t surprise me. Lyth is primarily a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question how long the hitter will get to leave a copy.
Lyth was elected seven times to the country team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play both at home and guests.
The only subject of complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first to Caribbean when Lyth was in top condition, but the lost chance is now the past.
Alex Hales will come with you, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
He has a cricket player of something we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he made 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but, of course, this depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
There has been an idea of Moeen in a hit-up next to Cook, where an extra feeder could be placed on the field but could be held four fast, and I am not against it.
I don't understand why a hitter could be hit there, and this left hand has already shown himself to be a pretty cricket player.
Moeen did not necessarily do his job in Worcestershire, but he is the third to them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 games at the first slow drop before he went to the opening in 2001.
He made three hundred points and didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari becomes a thieves team, and, the little I've been dealing with him, he feels like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his undecorated statistics - hitting the average 31 with the ball 35 - and think it's a gambling game, but there's no too much feeders and the voters chose the young.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach.
The appointment of a Sri Lankan hitter Mketju Jayawardene as consultant for games can prove to be a genius.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game and brings a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes with the white ball games and brings with him both energy and unpleasant degradation.
I’ve always thought that he was born to be involved in international crickets, whether playing or coaching, and he has the same useable surprises as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's team chef Durham, Ben Stokesia, is rested in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Even though not everyone agrees, coachs and electers do not make schedules.
And you need to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on light grounds.
British departures from the EU (Brexit) can export profits if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron’s half-sized re-negotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing increasingly major problems every day, even if it does not take into account even a hearty Jeremy “Is it yes or not?” Corby’s choice to lead the Labour Party or the Central Organisation of Professional Associations to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
The European diplomatic partner recently explained that because the EU is so deeply in different crisiss, not all of which are its own reasons, some Member States have been bored of the British self-centric agenda, full of consensus and disruptive contractual changes that these countries mostly do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Organization of Professional Associations decided that it does not want them if they shake social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agent.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance will delay the summits or bilateral meetings held in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local memorial with either a local eyewitness or without him, and then come home to winners for reforms.
Everything's about me.
My European friend, who wants outwards to look inside the British EU-telta - "Do not leave us alone with France", is said in Berlin - suggests that the shortest-looking ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point that they don't care about us leaving us.
German cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is a federal member, but he has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his work before it goes down the same way as it went too long for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Hollande has a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a disappearing force, too.
Poland may soon have a national right government, Spain has a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice for selfiebrits when their energy would rather be directed to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it because of similar separatist trends.
So, my friend suggests that some of these ministers can even consciously plan to make useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 British referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process.
"The new negotiations had been held" and "the new negotiations had nothing to do with Britain."
Europeans have gained a hairful experience of how the greedy Fleet Street newspaper can be and how the EU-sceptical press sovereigns are what they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum by Tony Bennin, when our membership started in 1973 was confirmed in the ratio 2:1.
They can incredibly remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist, who made a name for himself by writing "the EU's direct bananas" when he was the correspondent in Brussels at the beginning of the 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a number of tax-to-payers, foreign people hacking phones and persons whose home is nominally elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but he realized that if you're in the cage with a charming gorilla, bananas should be surrendered because of a disguise, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more brilliant than Blair himself, as it comes to opposing Cameron's re-negotiation, and Bair had admitted to the principle behind the EU's abandoned constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair the way out of the situation.
The press never forgived him for that.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly touched me at the Westminster House on Monday (I told him that he had no time to waste on me), seems to be at the risk of reintroducing Neil Kinnock's 80s boicocating the Murdochia strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, however, he has to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not me, but no doubt Andrew Marri, whom Corby left from the BBC coat on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position in Europe is, beautifully speaking, evolving.
He said that he would like us to remain in a renewed EU.
Well, most people outside the United Kingdom Independence Party, the Ukip War Inclusion and the Conservative Party can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn fan" Benn said this on both radio and TV this week when his internal patrol officer wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint Karski John McDonnell as a Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70th century when his father's father pinned on TV trying to be unfaithful to his government colleagues of the Labour Party without going so far to lose his seat.
Hilary's coatings were more attractive.
But for the fight to remain in the "wherever the situation" - Bennin's laude - it was not what McDonnell said, and not everything that Corbyn told the heads and representatives at the private meeting on Monday night.
Whether it is a hierarchical, emotional and personal image that Corbyn wants to care (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important during the period of day-to-day television, and in particular in social media’s rounds, which is a beneficial growth platform for paranoids and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to support the Labour Party in the referendum campaign itself.
Simon Jenkins thinks that.
But the basic tour between McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership (and, therefore, in line with their Benn-sensitive regulated economy and anti-capitalistic past) is no longer just a difficult discussion with left-wing thinkers whose narcissism of small differences is central to dogm in studying.
As for his two-digit relationship with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby does not campaign to give up), foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) to be granted to Britain when it can be completely unnecessary?
The United States has already disappointed the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the power of the Conservative Government that cuts costs, as I was recalled on Monday at the initiative of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England’s electric tobacco assessment
Scientists have said that the State-funded agency's claim that the electricity buckets are 95% less harmful than the traditional, started with a meeting of 12 people in which some were linked to the tobacco industry.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ) writers joined Lancet’s evidence of public health England (PHE) criticisms in their report on electricity tobacco.
The PHE published this "Standard" report last month, describing it as a "catable review of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical magazine Lancet published last month a headline in attacking the PHE’s main leadership decision against the "Extreme Huteran base".
The two other scientists written in BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine School, Professor Martin McKee of the European Public Health School, and Professor Simon Capewell of the University of Liverpool’s clinical epidemiology, says: “The main principle of national health is that action should be established for proven efficiency.”
They say that the public expects that the PHE's claim "the best estimate is that the electricity buckets are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on the detailed assessment and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, which developed a multi-criteria analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinion on adverse effects linked to various products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company called EuroSwiss Health, which was reported to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported the public health powers of BAT in the Sustainability Report, they say.
One of the 12 people announced that they received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they would add.
The panel members’ selection criteria are not mentioned, but the panel includes several well-known electric tobacco supporters, some of which also report that they have received funding from the field.
Others are not well-known for their experts in the control of tobacco.
The meeting was also attended by the CEO of PHE’s tobacco.
The study produced by the group “really admits” that there is a lack of “controversial evidence concerning harm in most of the products and most of the criteria”, McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "the 12th is no evidence that the electric tobacco operates as a route to burning on children or non-smoking persons" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, CEO of PHE health and well-being, says that the statements in BMJ have previously been answered.
He says, "The nuts are much less harmful than burning."
Half of the burners of their lifetime will die of their dependence.
All evidence suggests that the health risks caused by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to investigate long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what evidence shows and what it does not look like, especially when there is so much public ignorance compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die annually from smoking disease and smoke costs 2 billion pounds per year to NHS.
By explaining the current evidence, or even though the electric tubes are not riskless, their disadvantages are just a fraction of the detriment of traditional tobacco, we will fill our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, said former Channel 4
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson has said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would “do whatever” about the slowest soap series, such as this Albert Square street.
Johnson said that licence fees should only be used to make programmes that are not made by other British broadcasters.
He criticizes the BBC that it puts public-service programmes that are likely to have a smaller public, difficult broadcasting times against the most viewed programs of competitors and channels like BBC4.
After the BBC Director Tony Hall said that the company wants to work more with other organizations, Johnson said he started Channel 4 for six years to create a relationship with BBC, in vain.
“I don’t understand the idea that BBC produces and sends programs that would clearly agree to subventive competitors,” Johnson said to the Communications Committee in the upper room as part of its study on the future of BBC.
If the licence fee is closed - and I'm not sure it would be a good idea for this message or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not and do.
The Voicea will be sent to the main shipping time, as it is desired to gather as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would show the program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously stupid.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should be financed by programmes that could be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one of those and the EastEnders is the second, without any doubt in the house.
To be honest, the other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand how it is about broadcasting public service.
I don’t think it would weaken the BBC at all.”
In 2004-2010, the Serial Entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4, said that BBC would commit to the hunting of viewers for the purposes of the people working there, and because they believe it is the best way to achieve long-term support.
He commented on BBC's most popular series reminds us of Tony Ball's comments by former Sky leader. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC sells such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC’s smaller public public service programs “will go to BBC4, where we often can’t measure the number of viewers, but BBC will thus fulfil its responsibilities and then, in defending 4 billion pounds of license fees, can say hypocritically that we’re doing all these unknown programs that no one’s looking at.”
They're gonna put them on a shipping place where no one's ever gonna look at them.
With regard to the permit fee, Johnson said to the Committee, “I will find you looking for a more regressive system in which to get the most value.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year will get a lot of value, but I don’t know if it’s true for people with 150 pounds of money because they don’t use BBC much.
The former leader of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also proved to the Committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should re-evaluate its timely mission to "inform, train and entertain".
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of the radio - and that it should take a model from Australia and Canada's broadcasting broadcasts and change the role as "communication, illuminating and entertaining".
As regards partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he said are only shown on television, and join commercial companies so that they could all be viewed online.
Sound Genetics enables brain cell control through sound waves
The video shows how shuttles change the direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them by sound wavelengths.
Small shuttles change the direction as soon as they are hit by a voice pulse that is too high to hear the human ear.
Impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with ultrasonic reactive film channels.
Subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms show the functionality of the new, sound genetic method. It can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
A researcher at the Salk Institute of California, Sreekanth Chalasani told The Guardian that one day the method could replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive measure in which people’s brains are led to electrical impulses to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The shuttleworms normally do not respond to ultrasonic, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by the liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles reinforced ultrasonic waves, which then pass inside the worms.
Strengthened ultrasonic waves affect TRP-4-ionic acids, structures that are contained in some worm cell membranes.
The sound waves make these ionic channels open and activate the cells attached to them, are reported in the report published in the Nature Communications magazine.
To prepare ultrasonic shuttles, Chalasani genetically edited worms so that part of their motion nerve cells are TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasonic to customized worms, the microbubbles reinforced the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms where they switched on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has the same features as optogenetics, a career-driven tool that allows scientists to connect nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that sonogenetics can have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike the light that must be sent from optical fiber along the desired position of the brain within the brain, low-speed ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue inevitably, so they can be sent to the brain from the head of the skull.
“We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus can be possible to instantly respond to the targeted human nerve cells to the ultrasonic signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment,” Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to your home!
Advertisements may be a disgrace to the British Armed Commerce
See the video against Amnesty International Armed Fairs.
Horrifying killers!
Screwing legs!
Bounty bombs!
And electric boobs that cause painful pain, but do not leave traces!
The joyous voice and comic image language of the world’s largest weapons fairs are a sharp barode produced by Amnesty International to highlight the willingness of the British government to trade weapons for the repression governments at the International ExCeL Centre of Defense and Security Equipment in the London Ferry Area.
Subject: DSEI Armed Fairs: Authoritarian governments arrive in London
With a separate campaign, many posters appeared on bus stations and metro trains that require more accurate access.
"Accessive information, Do you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" together, you will be asked using the London underground font and brand, when the DLR track becomes a picture of the tank.
In this September, the flock of gun traders arrives at the DLR route... customers are asked to help stop the gun fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists who were present at the Museum of Cruel Designs of Banksyn Dismaland (the Museum of Public Plans).
A collector named Special Patrol Group helped spread posters all over London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This is six pounds packing six box keys, which collectively say "a third of the world's bus stations".
Transport for London has not been interested in this unauthorized "judicial quest".
One of the parodia advertisements produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and the University of Essex journalist Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists at the front of resistance when they realize they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to influence society.
Another anti-arm trafficking poster greets the work travellers in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been watched over the last 24 hours by Facebook, more than 100 000 times. It was created by the VCCP, and also by the graphic designer and background detector, was working for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever found that the gun fairs were not advertised at all - and the ExCeL calendar had an empty point - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the idea of more realistic ads of a superhuman corporation, but it was more stopping emphasising it with bright colors and animation.
“They’ve done fantastic work to help us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fairs,” says Tom Davies Amnestyn.
Now the UK government must take action and ensure that torture tools are not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in relation to the arms fair comes from the inside of ExCeL when samplers trade fantasticly decorated products.
In his press release, he announced that he received a order from the U.S. Army on the AT4CS RS.
This includes "a unique pipeline stretch that targets excellent impacts behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in a Student Apartment
It has been 11 years since I moved to a student apartment at the age of 19, and then I believed in barets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the human smiles of the people I was irritated - and numerous, long complaints from others.
Most of what I learned can be drawn into eight simple rules.
Changing into the apartment can be anything from the nerve to the completely frightening.
It’s attractive to say where you are from, did you like a mid-year and where you’re thinking about Corbyn, and why “I really don’t love or hate Marmite because it’s just a yeast thing to find me in my room.”
Take a breath.
And help others to draw a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and not those you don’t want to talk to, even if your eyelashes are on fire and they’re sharing the switches.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often transformed into cocktail invitations, cinema storage places and luxury entertainment places, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Subject: Don’t even imagine starting a university when you are in a relationship
The university is a difficult place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many apartments form a culture of walking from the room to another, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, "I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to leave now that I can collect back the energy I spent talking with you."
Try to sense when a student mate is tired of socialization, and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Coupling when it comes to a speech: knock.
One guy in my student's apartment thought if the door wasn't locked, he was called in.
He saw some pretty things.
Friendship through baking.
Since you start the university in the top season of baking pattern, knocking people in the doors with a chocolate baking plate and showing yourself seems to somewhat less strange, less "health in the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50s.
Providing self-made sweets is a great way to make friends.
Your partner feels obligated to talk and may be that they will continue to combine your face with a tasteful surprise.
This, of course, depends on whether you know how to bake.
Badly mixed flour-sugar-fat nuts are likely to only make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student apartments.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you only take a drop of milk on your tea?
Ask and check the owner of the milk.
It is possible that they give you permission, even though they are cooking inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you'll get my sympathy, but try to take it adulter than my flatmates, who mixed their milk in to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to noise so that people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you are like the pad of the proverb crawling the roof.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music quietly because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally slowed down at 5:00 in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before he put their music to blow, locked their doors and left for a three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would move to the same apartment with you?
Or reversely, wouldn’t it be incredibly embarrassing if you would consider a cottage partner as your future spouse, beat yourself together, divorced, and then you would see him every day, and possibly lose all your friends.
Of course, the heart wants what he wants, but if the hot cottage partner isn't really your future spouse, you could even try to talk to your bottom.
In the moment that you find that someone has left their keys in an unlocked room, the border between the scout and the temptation is thinner than it seems.
A good trick is fun, but it'll be cancelable in a moment.
You can give a useful and fun teaching for the safety of hiding something - but never mess with someone's room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in a freezer, but don't attach their property to the ceiling on the blue bar as much as twice as twice.
A racist attack for foreign students at the place of residence on Kite - The house planned for the reception centre was swept in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out in Kite, North Karelia.
Unlike the police previously said, this is not the accommodation of underage asylum seekers, but the sleep spaces of foreign students who have already stayed in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, the teacher of the Kite Evankelical University of Kite.
The windows and walls of the National College were swept with racist signs, such as hakarists, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the properties, says the Eastern Finland Police.
According to Luukkainen, a youth-guarantee training in the National University, the building was estimated to be 10 people at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some could be elsewhere,” says Ludwig.
The University has accommodations for people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All people in the building have a-statutes.
Some students study in adult primary school, part of professional studies and part of studying Finnish,” Luukkainen says.
The A status is a so-called ‘continuous residence permit’, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner already present in Finland for a while.
The Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an injuries and a violation of home peace.
According to a number of students, the event was held to students on Monday, an information conference where there were also the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one wanted to leave.
We've had foreign students for decades, and this is the first time something like this happens," says Ludwig.
A lot of people say the messes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
They were suspected to be at least three men and had been on a light passenger car.
I think this is a headache for the weekend of the young people when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Ludwig says.
There is also a hospital in Salo, which has been designed for the reception center.
The case happened last week.
MTV told me about it on his website Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was drawn by a hakaristi and written in English "You are not welcome".
The case has been reported to the police.
Description of 15 September at 16.02 Repaired by the police of incorrect information about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will terminate the Y train to Karjaa - the passengers in their chews, "the idiots"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepor will cease to pass in March.
The news inspired passengers at the Helsinki Main Railway Station at the beginning of the train.
In particular, the downtime strikes the Siuntiolas, said Torbjörn Bengtström.
It is idiotic because the population is growing all the time and the workforce needs a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
It can't be anything but political will or its lack.
Bengtström says HSTV's interview video will come to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also happening elsewhere in New Zealand.
On the main track, H and R trains are combined with a new R line.
Purola Station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR disclosed information on which routes the Ministry will buy train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period will change in the year-to-year period and the routes to be suspended are in the whole country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in the autumn, will be subsequently adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Siuntian Bengtström believes that the state train cutter is a short-sighted operation.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there's a regret.
The Y train is also used by non-raceporians and civilians because it is quick and overlooks several stations.
Espoo's Annina Pöyrya was harmed by the fate of travelling far from the city area.
“It’s especially bad for those who have to plan their journey again,” he said when he hurts his Y train.
Small relief is promised.
There is a new train connection to the beachfront that will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Seaway (HSL) area, which will lead to Kirkkonumme.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. practically for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now starting to figure out different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
The costs are still impossible to accurately assess.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars per year of the Y train, of course, the Ministry has paid much more than that.
The R line on the main track will miss two positions.
Instead, the number of trains in Ainola and Sauna Kallio will double.
The whole country ceases to have 28 small positions and numerous routes.
The minister will no longer buy train transport from routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to the route Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train shifts decrease on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips a year will be made with a break-off shift, with a total of nine million passengers on the transport purchased by the minister.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the state.
The value of the agreement is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote the chapter on the topic of capital: "It's worth studying with Marx."
The World Economic Crisis has raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and its final work published in 1867-1894, writes the topic of the capital of Marx, known as former President of the GDP, published today.
"He is now taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen wrote in his premiere.
Marx’s estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, the internationalisation and the invasion of all the areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have shown to be astonishingly remote.
The list of authors of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase also includes Professor of the University of Aalto, a respected economic player of Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx’s current “day and forever.”
But isn't the former CEO of the Institute of Economics and Economics, however, a Marxian?
Not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theoretical.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economic scientist, journalist, political agitator and literature lessons.
“The fact is that the history of the dead men tells of false opinions,” Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s predictions went badly.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions on the beginning of capitalism, Korkman will consider.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx’s radical installation.
"The most reliant thing in Marx is that he asked good questions," he said.
Now again, we are discussing the interests of Marx, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to the person who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of the technical implication," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not helpful for Marx.
He thinks capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
But Marx is worth studying with Korkman.
"In the 1970s, Marx couldn't read," Korkman said.
"The Romans and Trorchs and other sects hated all capitalism, but more and more each other."
Today, the debate is more versatile, and Marxia can be approached without the ideal and political weight load of the years back.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx's thought world, just like other classics," Korkman says.
The United Nations demands war criminals in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the Civil War in Sri Lanka, the news agency AFP says.
The UN report on the Civil War in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames both the armed forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels known as Tamilites.
The Civil War in Sri Lanka is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There is no accurate information about the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack of the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be investigated properly, the UN report requires.
The Sri Lanka Armed Forces report blames for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, whose victims were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have committed to forced side-by-side and children into fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it would arrange the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
The yo test of England was used to puntarize social media
In the autumn student’s writings there was a long foreign language on Wednesday, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 experiments were tested in England.
In the experiment, it could be written about social media.
Based on our own experience, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the text of the 150-250 word in English could be shown to the consultant of the web magazine.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is in charge of Finnish Leelia's rest chair.
He was asked how parents could look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects to choose one.
"It was the hardest of them," wrote the third topic of Porvoo's Swedish high school writer Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was only a sitate from former President Jose Manuel Barroso.
According to Lybeck, the fourth topic was very nice.
It had to write a fire speech why businesses should hire young people to work.
"We have been practicing writing speeches at least in our school," Lybeck says and estimates the whole test "all normal".
In the Finnish - or Swedish - English experiment, it was possible to answer the questions of texts, such as the adaptation of summer collar to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52), and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn writings will continue on Friday, when another domestic, Swedish or Finnish test is underway.
The test is normally conducted in the schools, i.e. the demonstration of the employees does not affect it.
The college degree board invites the exams to look for appropriate connections in time to get to the trial event.
You can also get more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own neglect.
Oulu has been robbed with a gun.
On Wednesday morning, Oulu was robbed in the city of Kello.
According to the police, the robber had dressed in dark clothes and his face was covered in a commando poem.
He's a normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a gun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating it as a brutal robbery.
Police are waiting for ten-century demonstrators to arrive in Helsinki - support teams from elsewhere in Finland
The demonstration against the government's surgery decisions will be blocked by the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to pre-information, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, the Open and STTK Association will meet at the Railway Market at 11:00.
Police are also believed to participate in demonstration.
On the other hand, the job of the police is not only to carry out alarms and other police activities, but also to ensure that the giant expression is smooth.
The roads leading to the railway track will be closed from motor vehicles for a period from 9.30 to 14.
Only alarm vehicles will be released to the area.
From Hakanieme's direction, the transport is cut off from Kaisaniem's traffic circle, from the west from Mannerheim.
Is there enough people in the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least so far, it seems that enough.
I don't take a position on the police's work fight.
As a result of the demonstration, the support teams from Finland are coming to Helsinki.
The exact patrols don't tell the police.
“Something is coming, but, in general, we can do it on our own,” Kujala says.
The police are asking to avoid private cargo in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic bag extends from the Hakaniemi level to its core center.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the night.
With demonstrators from elsewhere in Finland, many order buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They will not be released to the Railway.
The buses will leave time to go.
Then the rest of the journey should go to the demonstration site,” Kujala says.
The expression also stops the Helsinki public transport.
From the point of view of the police, there is also a positive side.
The problem of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally in the hands of these large gatherings, will now be dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the statement have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to go peacefully.
There are people who are normal working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
The Finns are reasonable and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
On Friday, local demonstrations are also held across Finland.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The great demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good reference in Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä, Emeritus Martti Siisiäinen.
It is not a wonder that the Ay movement protests.
If it didn’t, it would lift your hands up in front of the government, the cool says.
The very right-wing government has hit the Finnish Corporatism tradition in the core points - and also in the areas that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government’s hard shots are lacking in contract law.
Here are a lot of features that the Ay movement is actually trying to get on their knees.
The Ay movement also has a place to look into the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have any support for all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
The new is now the steep division that the demonstration will bring about amongst the people that the ay movement would want to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed across Finland showed their views at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday’s demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostorstai, organised in 1993, says.
In the middle of the deepest lama organized by Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (Central) government compromised from the labour market crisis to another.
It was said that among the Finnish government and wageholders’ organizations had never been as bad as during the Aho porvarian government.
Now, the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murrostorst.
In addition, there is now a very bourgeois government in Finland ever, the cool says.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so strict right in spite of the words of the Finnishs.
At the time of the ramp, there were certain elements of the old workforce movement.
There are a number of thousands of protesters on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day homes and schools.
Even though the demonstration does not receive undistributed support for wagers, it can become the largest for years.
In Helsinki, around 300 demonstrations have been held annually in recent years.
There's a lot of them.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish Ay movement have been quite calm - even though the practices have been tightening in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, being lawful.
The protesters are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property,” the cool says.
The end of the 1990s, however, brought new winds.
Contemporary culture changed.
The EU membership annoyed farmers to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get on pig shit.
The firemen strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes, including pilots and airline drivers.
Do you remember these strikes and protests?
The 1970s metal and electrical strikes
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electrical strike in 1977.
There were 70,000 metal men involved in the strike of metal men.
The strike was suspended by the reconciliation committee for seven weeks after the strike took place.
Metal men received a 16% wage increase.
In the spring of 1977, the electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused electricity breaks all over the country.
Murrostorstas in 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20,000 people, many people who were unemployed, met with the House of Parliament on 4 November 1993 to show their opinion on the behalf of the work.
Firemen striked three months in 1998
The strike of firemen was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
The police were exposed to chicken eggs in the protest of farmers against the EU in 1994.
“Siperia teaches, the EU stops,” one of the attacks.
Espale’s farmers smashed snow by tons.
In 1999, the Helsinki EU Summit also led farmers to protest and burn heinäpots in front of the meeting.
Nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
The nurses striked for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been in a strike in 1983.
A few cases of death during the strike were coloured during the 1995 strike.
Factory threatened to strike and nurses with mass withdrawals in 2007.
In the end, the threat of disintegration has accelerated the negotiations to the outcome.
Doctors striked 2001
"The Doctors at the strike - from the escape," was the attack of strikeing doctors in 2001.
The strike of local health centres and hospital doctors lasted for five months and brought an intense debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctor wages.
Students moving in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for study support from the Senate to the Parliamentary House in Helsinki in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police will find out the backgrounds of the Finnish truck full of refugees for the Austrian police
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to investigate the backgrounds of the refugee registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border, with 42 refugees on board.
There is no way to know if the truck was on its way to Finland.
All the cold trucks were in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility is at the venue in Austria, says Chief Commissioner Tero Haapala of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in Austria were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by choking.
According to the general broadcast, the truck belongs to the Finnish shareholder company, which first told the Austrian police.
The company is engaged in restaurant activities, and its CEO is a foreign-aged, about 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two of the Irish people have been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
Refugee captain, former drug abuser and brutal businessman - story of five smugglers
Upporikas smuggler king, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a good-minded taxi driver.
For example, such people carry human traffic in the European Union.
The Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola at Trento University and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed ten smugglers and their "asians", and the book they write about will appear in Finland this week.
In the book, they present smugglers of human smuggling, present solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them right away.
There are no attractions of foreign tourists on the eastern coast of Tunisia, but many Tunisians are heading to the summer holiday.
On behalf of its location, islands also fit for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa belonging to Italy is only 120 kilometres.
Due to comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, a chain of burning captain and the father of six children.
The islands are famous for their shrimp but the fishermen are more profitable to transport people.
That's what Emir has done with a blue, ten-metre wooden boat for hundreds of times.
If the boat fills up, it can accommodate 40 people.
With one trip, Emir will make about €8,000 after the cost.
Emir has five assistants looking for customers around Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arabian period a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape from restlessness.
After that, the situation calmed down until it revived with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir accommodations them in empty houses for as long as he sees good.
The food is given so that the customers are just and just staying alive.
The property costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer loses the money, it's their problem.
We're going to go to the water at midnight at the fastest detonated.
The first night is driven away from the island, then stop, wait a day, and drive to the next night to Lampedus.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in the waves of 20 metres, passengers cry and vomit.
In the destination, the human cargo has been dismantled in half an hour and Emir is leaving for a return trip.
Emir wants him to be afraid.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims to beat the speakers alive.
He says in the book that once the police assaulted him, he threw all his passengers across the border and told them to swim on the nearest island.
“I was one by one of my clients and thrown them over the edge,” Emir says.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
He says his countrymen have to assault this.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge.
A normal taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða in Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the starter engine is running their last, and anyway it's seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi is moving and moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to southwest.
The centre of asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly allowed.
Men travelling in the forests surrounding the center without their family will stay in tents, campuses and abandoned cars, which now anyone has managed to find or build.
In the forest, families who have not submitted asylum applications to Serbia for reasons or others.
Some also stay in private housing, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weekend walks in a heavy-duty landscape, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When finally arrives in Bogovaða, a large human smuggling node, people are fatigue.
Goran’s riders are mainly Syrian, Afghanistan, Pakistani, Iraqi, and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran says.
According to him, Africans are trying to do a tink.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
Stupid fools all the way.
At first, for example, 300 euros will be agreed, then they will drop it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran underlines being a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than anyone else, and he bills only EUR 50 per person from the Hungarian border.
It has a trip of one hundred kilometers, most of which are comfortable on the motorway.
My colleagues say they're asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a big amount for the smuggler, but it is quite a nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered taxis not to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care about it: he knows the roads and the short paths and takes his riders a mile away from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and shook away.
The Work of the Prayer
A 35-year-old congo-man is called Ambassador, and it is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant Church in Uganda in Kampala, a large number of refugees from Congo, as well as a small centre to help congo children refugees.
In addition to preaching, ambassador runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the ambassador to look good.
He polishs his shoes several times a day and ensures that the rubber tape of white underwear stylishly under the low belt of the jeans.
Ambassador is proud of his new Mercedes, his terrain car and three motorcycles.
When the Ambassador does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forwards to Europe.
At first, the customer calls to one of the five phone numbers of the Embassy.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money viciously and blew it in the midst of traders crossing the border.
In order to obtain a asylum seeker or refugee status, Uganda’s authorities must be told that it is from North Kivu’s war areas, for example, and that they have been forced to escape from their homes of violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary will arrange a new identity for the customer.
An old identity certificate will be removed and another will be acquired.
It helps the contacts of the Ambassador in the Uganda Police.
After that, the client will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum application procedure, the NGOs, finally the UNHCR of the UNHCR.
Ambassador knows bureaucracy because he has become a refugee in Uganda.
He bills separately from each gate: submission of an application to Uganda police costs about EUR 100, managing documents to a humanitarian organisation about 150 and a migration process, for example, EUR 4 500-7 000 in a European country.
Foliota and ice flames
Tom is a beginner smuggler, former drug abuser.
Fourty-five Irish custody on the French coast at Calais, where his job is to load people on cargo to the UK.
He has an Afghanistanian, French taxi driver and dozens of trucks who may not even know he is in the human traffic business.
During the night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere from the Calais Center.
They drive motorway A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would be in jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want, he's been sitting for seven years.
Taxi stops, Tom runs over his customers' motorways to a resting place where drivers sleep before they continue to cross the channel to British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - it must be ensured that it's on his way to England, and not even the Netherlands, and cut off the safety wizard.
It needs to be done quietly so that the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in the aluminum foil, the same thing that is wrapped around the cook or oven potato.
It should prevent the police's heat scanner from detecting the hiding person.
Some use the bedroom bags filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the place, hoping that the driver is not a quick flasher before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
Upporica Turkish has been called the Master of Marketing and the undisputed king of the Mediterranean's unlawful land rises, dominating sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage for other entrepreneurs: he only demands money.
One of the new methods is a luxury shippetition: Turkish ports are rented for villas to take Americans or European families for a few days of tourists.
In fact, ships will be loaded in full by Syrian, Iraqi, Kurdish and Afghanistan, which will be transported against a fee of EUR 5 000-7 000 from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe.
Customers are stored in human stocks, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are storing into minibuses and driving somewhere around the coast.
They are told to hide amongst the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under the deck.
The Maritime Guard can only observe the depth of the boat swimming, for other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers stool and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about 53,000 euros from one luxury ship trip after the cost.
He does not take practical care of himself, but hire captains, recruiters, guards, accommodations and other smaller factors to take care of the work for himself.
During the summer period, shipments are held at least hundreds and Küçük earns millions.
He is believed to have purchased undercover companies through the country, the pharmaceutical company and more than 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
After that, he's probably gone.
Correction on 16 September 5 at 15.10: The Death Travel Office will be published this week, not next week.
The American Olympic Joker tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book called Fast Girl, tells us about the ending of his career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published breaks from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career for Sydney's Olympics.
He came to the races in the top and ran in the cartoons for the second best time.
In the final, he was panicked.
He drove to the top immediately at the beginning and defended his leadership on the ground run.
However, 150 meters before the goal, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed into the surface of the track, and other competitors passed him by one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the goal line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later, Favor Hamilton suffered two-way mood disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney’s races, and he himself felt huge pressures on success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple did not have any economic problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strangers.
He also spoke to his husband to accept his action.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was EUR 450 per hour.
He says he used the money for a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations in becoming prostituted was also that he needed similar adrenaline spikes as he had been competing in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had two-way mood disorder.
The double life of the former star driver came out at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun published a article.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was at 1500 metres of the world’s statistical community at 3.57.40, but remained the last of Sydney’s Olympics.
The world champion was delighted when the union put the Norwegian skiing coupon in control: "The Strawberry"
The Norwegian skiing king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of fitness in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian Skiing Union have twisted the entire summer and autumn, as last year, the athlete agreement.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for a multiplicated world champion and Olympic winner.
The result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian Skiing Association decided to close Northug out of the World Cup of the coming season.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the union ran the skier.
"Thank you for showing the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union,” he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Skiing Union and Northug is about money.
Northug would probably like to be part of the seasonal team so that he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent the union, which also cares for future generations, and does not give one athlete’s solos.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because it is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own newsletter in which he said he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colors in the next season in the World Cup as well as after the MMs and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MM medals in his career, two of which were gold.
He was in the last winter in Falun, a team that won a messenger.
The shielding day of the paste translators is also spent in the Nordic country.
On the day of shielding, 25.9., tricks are held in various restaurants and shops that have been granted the Paist Translators' shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight the high level of food skills in Finland and to lower the threshold of departure to the restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the balloon as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have focused on the capital area, but the top restaurants audited and classified by an impartial operator are found around Finland.
The international attention given to the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of the enhancement of the awareness of thyroid foods and organization.
In the Nordic country, the day will be held in the Vaasa restaurant in Fondiks and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town restaurant is participating in the shield day.
The event has also gained significant international attention.
The event has been decided to make one of the most important international events of the organization that are held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki Magazine: The establishment of a Disastrous reception centre for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are in collaboration with the establishment of the Refugee reception centre in the premises of the Ex-space of Kauhava, currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region still has a critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, namely the Finnish Erillisverkot Oy.
The Kauhajoki magazine says that the establishment of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant risk of safety that has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the Defense Forces may have interest in the former Air War School region and airport, which has no effect on the preparation of the reception centre, writes the newspaper.
The case states that, for the last two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
The issue has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistön (ps.) and Head of Office of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädy.
A private person notes to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a question of the principle of objection of the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former reserve area is wrong.
The terrible city government dealt with the reception centre last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The government means that there are the necessary conditions for immigrants and those who are here, Niinistö commented on journalists in the evening after meeting the presidents of all the parliamentary parties in their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern of the management of the refugee situation was combined with all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to the situation in Syria and the activities of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation of Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
Societies are hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia are able to do so, it has an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the still tension of the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to that, the NATO issue was also ignored in the discussions.
The president did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Starts catching a couple of hours

The opinion closes the streets of the Helsinki Centre
Friday's demonstration closes the streets of the Helsinki Centre.
The police say that the streets leading to the Railwayway will be shut down from the cars about 9.30-14 a.m.
From the direction of the Mannerheimins, cars will not be released in the direction of the Railway Station.
Transport from Hakaniemi to the Union Road will be directed to the Union Street at Kaisaniem’s transport circle.

Only alarm vehicles will be released to the area.
Metro and wheelchairs throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from the morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Ratio and Metro staff told the STT tonight.
Most of the Beginnings close for two hours, including posts closed

In addition, the afternoon activities of developing people with disabilities and autist schools are normally carried out.
The Early Education Agency will allow you to report more of the changes to the activities tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipila, the communication requires diverse channels, and the Prime Minister's TV and radio calls are one of the channels among others.
This channel of direct speech is also needed in the future.
This will not remain the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in the Parliament.
Sipila did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister’s TV and radio talks are going to be repeated.
According to Sipila, speeches may not always be communicated in the Yle channels.
If other channels are registered as channels, then let's see.
Now, this channel is used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipila, the state of Finland’s economy is so serious that it requires the public to keep a television and radio call.
This set of things we are talking about is quite complex and requires a further explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel.
The speech will be sent from 21.05-21.20 in both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
It can also be seen in Yle Areena.
Sipila Takes a Big Risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipila’s TV talk does not tell the general government about turning in.
Is it an effort to take the definition of the public debate more closely into its own hands and refuse to discuss the questions of the public?
It reminds the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin’s recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things do not relate to each other.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is upset by the announcement of Sipila.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
Political decision-makers’ communications styles are not about democracy.
The role of media representatives is to make a clear effort not to be taken by politicians.
According to Koivus, TV talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipila should bring something new and special into the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations for the speech.
Is there more to offer today what we have already heard?
Or can he speak in a different way, differently or differently, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, you need to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
Ylekin is taking this risk in this regard if it is not a particular situation but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be stamped as a messenger of politicians or parliament and government, which will certainly not be in line with the interests or general line.
Squirrel squirrel
In the future speech of Sipila, it is also important that what the Prime Minister does not say, the media researcher stresses.
Tonight, we need to look carefully at where Sipilä is missing and where not, says Jyväskylä University Research Coordinator Heikki Kuutti.
According to the Cube, the TV speech is a doorstep bet from Sipila, because this makes it possible to bring out its own view without a sora sound.
This will give the public a message without a journalist filter, unlike the press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipila passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media interprets something wrong about the speech because the specific questions are not allowed.
Six says it’s very important how Sipila occurs on TV, the sweat of sweating, whether your hands are shaking.
He compares Sipila to the father who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä is able to play his business well, it can work.
The situation is different than when the government informs about something, because this person is talking directly to another person.
This is what (US President Barack) Obama and partners regularly practice.
Very extraordinary
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the speech of the Prime Minister to be very exceptional to the citizens.
He said it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would like to congratulate Finns on the extortions ahead.
On Friday, wageholder organisations organise demonstrations and strikes against government actions.
President Paavo Arhinmäki, on Twitter, said that Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
The SDP President, Antti Rinne (sd.), once again, announces its challenge for Sipila's dialogue.
There is no time for monologs.
About half a year from the elections.
In the end, you cannot hide, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a escape trip has been found in Tampere
At the time the boy was found, he was fine.
The boy’s father updated his Facebook page.
The Internal Finland Police Department also confirms the case for the evening newspaper.
The boy left to play out at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks everyone who helped me look for them.
Thank you for these ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time
The Finnish UFC star disappointed in the violent wildness of young people: You can cause hatred
Makwan Amirkhani released a video on Facebook, in which he particularly appeals to young immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani had a serious speech against the street fights of young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived five years old with his family, has won both their professional match in the most respected UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me he received a message in which he was asked to look at one of the Instagram accounts.
The account has been downloaded with videos where young people fight with extreme violent patterns.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed in the wildness of young people.
Amirkhan, aged 26, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the people on the ground, sit on the other one and beat the eyelessly without thinking of any of these consequences, what this is going to happen when you make videos like this, Amircani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people displayed on videos are immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinose, social media fight videos have been downloaded by both immigrants and Finnish young people.
The fact is that you're fighting their top street.
You make the life of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds me.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite a lot.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be a long time of guests here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, says Amirkhani.
Amircani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they are sometimes subject to racism, you will be charged with it.
Think about it a few times before you go with me, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action will make a contribution to racism.
You'll get anger in me that I don't like myself.
You have things wrong anyway, and you don't cure them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, on Twitter, says that the wageholder organization will consider its position on Monday on the alternative savings list presented by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK's proposal on Twitter.
The STTK previously told the government to present its own proposal on Wednesday, in order to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
Mr Sture Fjäder believes that the government will accept the proposal if the SAK, STTK and the Opening Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest wageholder organisation to soften its previous position.
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented poorly on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this issue on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that the position of forced laws requires agreements made by active parties.
Lyly reminds the Prime Minister Sipila’s Government’s proposal for a social agreement was not suitable for the SAK.
Sipilä had previously interrupted the negotiation of the social agreement when the SAK refused to commit to the target of the 5% productivity phase.
Comments on: The great opinion threatens to shine - "It feels a little funny to puke a fist"
It feels a little funny to wear a fist, if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, write Pekka Tiinanen.
The emotions vary from the edge in the payer camp.
Are you supposed to be shouting the government or agreeing with it?
On Monday, the SAK federal leaders revolted on holy hatred against the Government of the Republic.
The whole country was threatened to catch.
The threat also spread to the adventures.
The teachers’ professional organization, OAJ, threatened to close schools and daycare.
On Tuesday, OAJ canceled: no school or daycare is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STTK, appeared in a coordinated manner.
He said he kept in touch with the government and produced an alternative presentation required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) as a 5% productivity scene.
Sture Fjäder (kok), the President of the Planet, prompted to announce that his accord paper is already ready.
At first, the SAK office didn’t have anything to do with it.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the federal leaders just ordered the country to stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to address the situation and that the SAK will look for solutions to open the labour market lock.
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should tend to accept a 5% productivity gap as a target.
There is no wonder that the STTK of Palola has relations with the government of Sipila.
The right hand of the fire, director Jukka Ideus of the STTK, was formerly the special support of Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinieme.
The fire described that the government's ay skills have been improved all the time.
It was a case or not, but the output of the Palola took a little clean off from the Finnish standers, whose rolling picture is the wedding of the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
It feels a little funny to wear a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited at 18:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again."
Russian Duma President Sergei Naryshkin criticized the OSCE meeting.
The Russian Duma President, Sergei Naryshkin, believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the presidential session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, in which Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July Helsinki celebration meeting.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced on the European Union, to come to the meeting - a matter from which the President resembled journalists.
According to our assessment, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed the news office according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was not only for Finland and the EU, but for the United States, where its access was also blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation became complicated, so Naryshkin continued to blink Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for the "special organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly will proceed constructively and positively - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there are no obstacles to parliamentary dialogues.
Naryshkin has met the Ilkka Kanerva (kok), leading to the meeting in Ula Bator, who has already been discussing Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Makes tight"
Tappara and Lukko continue in the Hakamets today for bull days when both are fired on the second day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today, in the Hakamets, there is no real goal celebration.
The killer went to Kuopio last night to scout 3-2 consecutive wins from Kalpa.
The rise was male, for the last season the silver group was the worst of the two goals of the defeat position.
Tuesday, the lock was more brilliant.
As a guest of Blues, the Raumans’ catch was round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any of you play the same game as last year, Lukko-higher Janne Lahti predicts the settings of the club on the pages.
The killing has become a pretty playoff nightmare for the rubbish.
In fact, in the last two years, Tappara has just dropped out of the Lock's final series.
Both layers require a decisive seventh mat.
During the last season, Lukko took the series off in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three sides and over.
There are no major changes in group compositions except target guards.
The two of us who opposed yesterday will have a skateboard shift today.
On the goal of the killing, Mika Noronen will make room for Tomi Karhuse, and between the Lukko-tolps, Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolsk.
View angle: A miserable play in the autumn runs
Hopela, the sports director, handwriting a non-compliant post to the main coach of Rautakalli, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone scripted a Rocky movie where he himself played the main part.
The subordinate sent to the campus for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky gained great sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
After thirty years of Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola scripted a restless Tuhkimo story in Pori.
Anonymous and wood-handed batteries progressed to everyone’s astonishing SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of nominal, but firm subordinates like Rocky.
It was white Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, players colored their heads red and cut the irocesis.
Hope became a blonde.
JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
The ace took the winning silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The author Hopela believes that this season’s news works work the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director has built a devil for the evil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been ruining a bunch of rocky pig carrots at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in some other way than in a stunning game.
Hopela has forgotten that the main part of Rocky VI is Pekka Rautatalio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Rautakallion Sean Connery.
Rautahallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original 1976.
There's nothing else in the iron cliff than Rocky's nickname.
The game philosophy of Rautakallion does not include assaulting and squirting.
He appreciates a hard game, but it is different to play hard than a pig.
During the last season, the Essien Garret Stafford took the Tapparan Jere Karjala's head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve.
I do not accept such a game, and it belongs to the ace hockey, and Rautakallio, who went hot after the game, woke up to the people of the Satakunta.
This season's team has been strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, cops and emitters.
There are no key players in the best game age.
No wonder the main coach complained about the lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence players’ projects, Pekka Rautahallio?
Last season’s events affect the acquisitions and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite limited, Rautakallio responded diplomaticly.
Under the surface, he's in touch.
The yearly model of 1953 Rautakalio is known to be interested in moving to Hopela’s position as a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in spring.
The balance of the chess in the three leagues of the season has the same number of losses with the goal gap of 1-6.
Hopelan wouldn't have been able to handwritten a further part.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa Claus's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met his husband as Tuuka a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time in the direction of his husband.
Yeah, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, an actress, and the producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulannan’s ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has worked a lot together before, but now Olga plays the first time in the direction of Tuuka.
The role of Olga in the early years of Apulanna, you made us a beautiful film, is a drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother, Sirkka.
Clever twists and supports his son, even though this father Risto (which is presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be a sound of sense.
The more I’ve seen my real example in Sirka, the easier it feels to play a role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka that he trusted me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but then the two have a lot closer.
They've met, spoken on the phone and communicated.
Circus has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, it is also clear that the drama is a drama and the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga underlines that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Assistant would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 90s, it was lame and very harsh.
There was quite a small probability that someone actually succeeded, but Sirka had some kind of intuition, and he was right.
Olga says he had heard a lot about this youth from Tuuka before the film plans.
However, parents’ stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you're doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different than the evil-remembered Tuuka of Heinola.
Olga was an ark and a nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At least he could have been in love with secretly.
According to Olga, he has worked so much with Tuuka over 10 years that the big joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole production group will go to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in India is often planning to drive home because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole Heinola month.
They have taken us very warmly, asked only what streets and when they will be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive film in Finland
Iron Sky, directed by Timo Vuorensola: The Coming Race, the budget is 17 million euros.
The descriptions begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola starts shooting the Iron Sky 2 film in October Belgium.
The Scifi movie, the Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become the most expensive film in Finland in its budget of €17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animated in progress will also rise after the completion of Iron Sky 2, as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
The films directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukoma begin in October near Antwerp in AED Studios and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola goes to Belgium next week.
The garbage budget is not afraid.
I've been sickly relaxed!
I have a so relaxed script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that they are doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and I can't wait to show this movie to the public, he's gonna tell the newspaper.
Initially, the budget for the film was 8-10 million, but the budget also increased when the script was developed.
The budget is big, but there's a big stoor.
However, 100 million people would be stuck in the movie because each angle and efficiency are so expensive.
Now everything is so tight that there is no looseness.
Today, Iron Sky Universe launched a mass funding campaign and a bond of 4-8% annual interest.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Is it cool or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters’ breasts have recently decorated large logos.
Even some time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and large logos like Crocs in a console.
The advertising of a t-shirt or a t-shirt was somewhat seen as a junt.
Times change.
Sports has become the right fashion megatrend, and also old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike have risen to coolness waveharja.
And as often before, the funny and trendy boundary is shy: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came a standard core trend, i.e. a tavis fashion, where trenders surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothes as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a grey basic college, it is already in the bottom of the cabinet that has been buried in the sleeves before the manufacturer’s logo comes in.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logs, for example, the tracks identified by Adidas, the favorite team's shirts and the New York Yankees tickets have made a return to the street fashion.
The farch edge begins to scratch Calvin Klein logos is now a cool detail.
Trendi seems to be moving from sports to luxury brands.
For example, the chest of Versace's syspusers makes it clear what a sign of clothing it is.
Would you be ready to introduce logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank!
According to the statements, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to remove large sizes of Zotovia from the tank lock for five hours.
Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, where he seems to squeeze the armor vehicle in quite good moods, and at least on the basis of those images, it’s about catching or madness.
Total foolishness.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, but it was a collision tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served on Ural.
I went in there, looked around me, and I came out in peace, Zotov said the Comosomolskaja Pravda.
I didn’t get stuck, I certainly didn’t spend five hours in that position, he said.
The Russian Army TV channel Zotov explained his enthusiasm in the exhibition of Russia’s new technology because he is a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was curious about what's inside the cars, I inspired our techniques.
And I came out through the back lock, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely go to all tanks and all assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the writer's idiot.
One fool wrote, and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm long and rotating, but nothing that I would be stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba to the radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photograph of alleged congestion has been published, even though there were a total of 50,000 people on the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck began to move on from the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotovin was told about his ribbons when he tried to get out of the tank lock and eventually threatened to shoot all around him unless he gets out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story where the exhibition organisers reported their own views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to the fact that the soldiers jump out of armed vehicles quickly.
But the Popular Representative Zotov, due to his size, simply delayed when he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski Bloknot.

Architecture Brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen's candle from 1962 looks like it was designed today.
The six-sized steel structure is like an artwork, and that was originally what it was.
Architecture brothers are known for the shape of the candle for long and mathematically accurately.
At first, it was only presented to the Lords’ respected dinner guests.
Kubus candles are produced by a family company By Lassen, who maintains the design heritage of famous brothers.
The candles are made by hand in Holstebro in Denmark in the form of eight, four and one candles, in four different colors.

The Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland's Kittilän mine has been bleeding.
The purified process water of gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand to its stream.
According to the company, measures to correct the leakage have begun.
The pool has neutralized enrichment sand and cleaned process water.
Usually, water is pumped either again as process water or led to the environment through the surface area, as authorised.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leakage water meets the current terms of authorisation.
The other material did not flow into the environment.
The bleeding was observed in the inspection round Monday morning.
The leak has not been observed to cause structural damage to the underground fertilizer structures.
The company says that it will work closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred established employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns you not to cut too much
The Finnish country report published by the International Monetary Fund today follows largely the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization swept into structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime compensation and pay-free days would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed throughout the contracting system and unemployment security.
According to the main economicist Pasi Kuoppamäe, the Danske Bank agrees with structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates a lot of communications to the government’s actions, but on the other hand, there are also warning words about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to the Economy Reports.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support poor economic growth.
The IMF estimates that this year Finland will increase by 0.4%, which will increase to 0.9% next year.
Danske predicts that growth will remain zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They could have had the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland said the total production was in small growth in the summer, Kuoppamäki said.
The weakened trust in industry or other so-called softer metrics could have been given less attention.
However, the difference is just a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader.
In July, Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer, worked under Tatsumi Kimishima on Wednesday, told Nintendo on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charistant face in the game industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to a successful Wii console launch.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assessing Ace Research Analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to see that Nintendo is strongly involved in mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency acknowledged that hundreds of children who have arrived in the country will disappear annually.
In particular, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, according to the Swedish Immigration Agency, hundreds of minor applicants disappear annually.
Juha Kannelmaa, CEO of the Immigration Agency, tells us what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear in a year?- In Finland, 156 applications for asylum received alone were made in 2013.
They disappeared nine.
In 2014, the corresponding applications were made 196 and they disappeared 11, Kannelmaa says.
The background of the disappearance may be that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found full-aged there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will be found later when they apply for asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, in Finland there were 3651 asylum seekers, of which 134 applications were made for a revocation decision because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past 123 years, he said.
Is there a number in growth?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 petitions of minors alone.
There is no total statistics on the missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of minor applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing people.
What happens to those who have been converted?
Do they, for example, disappear from the “smooth labour market” market?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Agency, as the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He has taken action on the matter.
At the EU Interior Ministerial Meeting, Orpo, who discussed refugees’ issues, reported on Monday practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see photos of the devices
Due to disease attacks, Timo T.A. Mikkose’s equipment used for television and radio productions have now been sold.
Mikkosen's spouse, Nina Mikkonen, sells Huuto.net devices that were the most advanced professional tools in the industry.
The online announcement was first reported by the website of Iltamakasin.
Today, most of the devices have remained in the legs of technological development.
The digital media world no longer describes television programs for Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested people are found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but they are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitalized.
On the other hand, there are many enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from the current Myrskylä home.
We can't take all the amount of goods with us.
I've started to invent and see where the goods are released.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no use for television and radio devices anymore.
It is clear from the rear acute infarctions that a long career man will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s real life work was archived in the summer of the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other materials from Storm.
Traffic threatens to fade worse than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metron and tram drivers today decide whether they will expand their power in relation to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the time of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be clear if the traffic stops all day.
Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is large on the field.
Night and intermediate cuts are badly brightened by drivers, so the government’s plans to cut the licences are advocating.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams are stationed by Friday, public transport is almost completely stationed in the capital area.
According to the VR, trains do not travel between 6:00 and 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
On Friday, there is no distance and no distance traffic.
The trains left before 6 a.m. will be driven to stations.
According to the HSL data, most of the buses remain on the varieties.
The members of the ACP are gone from work on Friday to 3:00 a.m. on Saturday mornings.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by superpower, and Pirkko Repo, the HSL reporter.
Repo says HSL can’t tell you exactly what bus shifts are going on Friday.
Employee organisations organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Rautatietori on Friday from 11 to 13 pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tears against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tears.
The incident took place at the border of Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to get forward to Europe, says the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water tanks against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas - the teacher thought it was a bomb.
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after the teacher considered his own watch to be a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he only wanted to introduce him to the output of his electronics.
However, one of the teachers thought the watch was like a bomb.
The police were called and the situation ended in the end of the time that the boy was taken into the arrest cell of the young people in handcuffs.
Mohamed has not been found to claim anything but that he had made the clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had seen the watch look like a movie bomb.
The clock is in custody of the police, but it consisted of a circuit board and a digital display between the leaders.
The case occurred last Monday, and Mohamedia was punished by three days of forced leave from school.
His father is angry and the US-Islamic Council wonders whether the case is another example of Islamophobia in the United States.
United Kingdom - The Labour Director refused to sing a national song
In the song God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the monarchy.
Corbyn’s own Labour Party representatives have also joined the opinion of the press that will fall into justice.
This has insulted the people, suspected the labour citizen of Kate Green in the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night, the British Air Force flyers fought against Germany Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses his respect for the airlines by participating in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude for the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood quietly during the national song, highlighted in the opinion.
Corbyn's choice to be a party leader has divided into labour lines.
In particular, there are those who fear he will deport moderate voters with their radical views.
Corby supports unilateral disarmament, ending savings and increasing public spending.
Corbyn is supposed to be the first party leader in the House today at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public about what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron picked up Corbyn on a week-to-week Twitter as a party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister referred to his own account.
The cause of Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the father was waiting for a case of justice.
South Lake Minnetonka Police have been investigating a family death in Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
The five-sex family was found dead in her home on September 10, and a few days later, the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting the first shot at his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this notice, police went to the house for an inspection and found a huge house across the short family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims have been dead for days.
Million House and Successful Company
South Lake Minnetonka's police chief Michael Sitar's case is still under investigation.
The motivation of the networks is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on the social media website of AllNurses.com.
In 2014, the StarTribune interview, Short, said there were four million visitors on the site every week.
For me, 50 purchases have been made over the past ten years.
I have abandoned all of them.
But I still have a lot of ideas I want to do.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the fact that Short’s family bought two million dollars from Greenwood in 2011.
The house is advertised in Zillow as a dream of a car collector: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight cars with enough garage.
The case in progress
According to StarTribune, the father of the family was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep has challenged him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, no comments were removed from Short’s site, and they had therefore lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial had had a significant impact on short business.
Vesku Loiri offered cakes
In addition, the owner-third was awarded at a nutritional event with the Finnish Hippos month horseowner award.
This is a great one, Loiri commented on his charity table.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned $100,000.
The artist legenda Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo’s success in a major competition.
I still don't think it happened.
According to Loir, the coach of successshevose will receive full work peace working with the horse.
Pekka decides and decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut up, Loiri.
The great gesture of the NHL star - "The greatest athlete of all time."
Montreal Canadiens' superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (approximately EUR 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the medical report, this is the largest single donation made by an athlete in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital in another fund collection for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with Canadiens for eight years and 72 million dollars a year ago.
Subban’s donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his nine million dollars.
Subban receives a subway space with its name.
The players of Canadiens have helped local hospitals considerably before.
A year ago, a long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same child hospital and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city’s major hospital to get to the hospital a PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
You can order a wife for tonight - serves food with only bikini and essence on your head
The thematic cafes are a hard thing in Japan.
The market already has a goat cafe, a cannabis cafe, a vampire cafe, a halikahvila, and now a wife cafe.
It hits solitary, social and hunger.
The Metro's news.
The Ore no Yome (Female) coffee shop can order a wife or husband for the evening.

The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the wife’s candidate to what mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: Attacks against the security of cars began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, the Intel published.
The board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising the best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of the best practices of cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB's research results.
The International ICT Research and Consultation Company Gartner estimates that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles are connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish the best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important ingredient in the design of each connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about EUR 52,000 in Finland!
Ford Focus RS has been expected for years to rise as a month.
Finally, the car begins to be in the perspective of Finland.
Ford released the RS data now that the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt car exhibition.
Ford’s new four-two RS is accelerated by its 2,3 liter, 350 horse-powered engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and its peak speed is 266 kilometres per hour.
The price is also interesting in Finland, initially it is reported to be EUR 52,000.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when it comes to Finland.
Kia’s favourite brand presented two news in the Frankfurt car exhibition - such is a new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation of Sportage is definitely more important than two innovations in Finland, where Kia intends to catch a larger wing from the growing street landscape market.
The new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, created by Sportage, is more rounder than before.
In the axle range and outskirts, the second inch has come here and the car breaks the air more efficiently.
The engine range is mostly the same, but there is 1,6 liter turbo that develops 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales revenue.
We have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage arrives for us in spring 2016.
Even before the shift of the year, the new Kia Optims came to our country.
Suddenly, the news doesn’t seem to change, but it’s a new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle-class buyers with better driving features, lower noise level and higher-level equipment.
Optims with 1,7 liter turbodiesel and 2,0 liter gasoline engines are received at the beginning.
Next summer, the speed accelerates when they arrive at 2.0 liter turbo engines with Optima GT.
At the same time, with its income, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu returned to the stages - squeezed in a brave shaft
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child Concert with other domestic stars.
The electric pants have a visible, open neck hole.
The apartment is beautifully presenting the singer's belt.
The total size of the crown is golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the mother-in-law singer has been depressed by mild exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year.
The singer released his first single on a new album in August.
Back to the stages and the rise to the public after a long break is not really exciting for me.
I've missed everything about music, the singer says.
Chisu publishes a new album called Polaris after a few weeks.
The new situation of life has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think about it.
Kim Kardashian's motherhood resentment - now she's showing the chest
The true TV beauty of Kim Kardashian gives topics for each other.
She presents her pregnancy waist and breast clothing in sexy clothes, last night at one of America's times when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian's husband Kanye West's show.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the lightning dress.
Last time Kardashian dressed for an amateur motherhood when she visited her friend for dinner in New York just a few days ago.
The black over-generation boots highlighted the point.
The third special maternity suit is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when the show was in pregnancy.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you are lonely, competition is terrible
Manon Leloup wanted to understand that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne celebrations.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls (Puhuvat Dolls), where Leloup and his colleagues talk about pure modeling business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine assembled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins with nothing.
Even if during the previous period you have been pose in top designers’ suits, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete from work with concars.
They rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or apartment in which fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother can’t travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the jobs they want, but they are the most stressful.
There is not just one kind of weight loss.
Agent New York might ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
Models and designers are all the time together and operate as a support network.
When the fashion tips end, the difference is shaky.
Models want to be in this area because of the potential they offer, but they are used by the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models also want to be their own people.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors with some role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
You modeled yesterday at the Tory Burch show.
New York is currently hosting fashion weeks where designers will reveal their models next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, presents the most unknown assistant musician in the movie
In a film based on the early years of the Assistant Association, Roope Salminen presents the founding member of the band, Antti Lautala.
Lautala established Apulannan in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but separated from the band in 1994.
It's a big challenge for me because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I play a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Ant before the descriptions, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people from that crowd, so I think it’s good to learn his playstyle from the video.
I don't want to make an imitation about a man.
The man who trusts the Roope Salminen and the Dogs is not going to play the role.
The Punk Manners come by the man's nature.
In the punk period of the Stars, the stars will certainly have seen the premiere, as well as if you’ve ever been to our work.
Our presence has never been anything small, but we always go full.
Assistant in 1993-2004, Tuukka Temosen directed by us, the main actors of a beautiful film were released today.
The group’s public-known nuclear forces are presented by young actresses who are not yet familiar to the public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukkia presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo base from Tuukka Temo, Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint of his future pestilence last night, when he told Snapchat that he would mysteriously prepare his career for the most important day.
Roope has released a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he had to perform for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the fungus and jaws, has been driving her face into siloposchic, and dyeing brown hair into black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have recently had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling about it at all?
It is not necessary to speak, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children are worth protecting, for example, not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and they can stay in mind and be distressed, he says.
However, if the child has encountered a television news photograph of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth speaking.
It is good to take a look at the starting points of the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of the child may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones that the parents think he is afraid of.
The child should not be frightened for nothing, even if he would be distressed and frightened.
The smaller child closely monitors the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe.
The older children are likely to encounter a debate on refugees in school, with friends or online.
Parents are good to take the matter with them if you think about the child.
The fact is that all people in the world are not well.
Parents, together with children, can think about how our family feels about this.
But is the world a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also talks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come forward in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teaching your children to help the weaker"
Your own power at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child.
Ballosalamaa is hard to control
Perttu Pohjola was stirred to the Apila Pallosalma in the middle of the summer.
It only led to wins and two places until the end of July a collapse in Tampere.
Since the ori was clogged in the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered it from the veterinarian for time.
The explanation for the extinction survived in the glider.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not the lesser to get away, but it was needed two curtains.
Since the Pallosalma of Apila had to be in light exercise, the Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku in a recording time after the second SE tamma in Taruntuule.
Apilan Ballosalama was at a pause when it had been able to drive normally only a few weeks.
These things at the end of the small tendency were understandable, Northeast says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made a blade for the slaves.
The horse's vibe must have gone forward, and hopefully it would also have been settled.
Apila Pallosalma has been so-called humor horses.
When it hasn't been fun, it could have thrown fat without diseases.
On the good day, the slaves have removed such a lightning letter that the opponents have been wondering.
In a quick speed, competitors are not able to manage the Pallosalama, from which even warm blood-blooded rides are removed.
The hopes of the north are in Vermo.
However, the different thing is how Apilan Pallosalma agrees with it.
It is quite difficult at the time of departure, and it may be under the bucket of the car and like that.
I hope the slave would be more calm than Turku's leaving.
Apila Pallosalma can also come out of the bow, and we are going to drive with it from victory, coach promise.
This is why you will not get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs
Tim Cook, Apple's CEO.
At least some of the future programs with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple will potentially remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, explains Tim Cook Buzzfeed’s executive director in the interview.
Apple's iPhone has a set of programs that are relatively rare to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Journalism, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips will come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is necessary only for Apple's smart clock owners.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook says Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work firmly together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating it, since the company does not want to waste memory on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation of the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
In August, the euro area’s consumer prices increased only scarcely, i.e. 0.1% of the year ago, and Eurostat said today by the European Statistical Authority.
The rise in prices was reduced by the low cost of energy.
Eurostat thus reviewed a slightly downward rate of 0.2% guarantee for a couple of weeks.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate for the underlying inflation was 1.0%.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2 per cent cheaper than a year ago.
The average inflation in the EU-28 was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Most of the euro countries, i.e. 1.4% of consumer prices, increased in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest at 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation of the euro area remains firmly far from the European Central Bank (ECB) objective, which is the average price increase of 2%.
The ECB predicts an average inflation of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the increase will increase to 1.1%, the central bank will expect new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The United States Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next recession of the United States begins with its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed regains interest rates for a long time.
The downturn in the financial markets begins before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that the interest rates will be started even this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be pressed on at the fastest by next autumn and as a course of the financial market before that.
Or at least this happens if the world’s largest economy and financial markets work as they have been habitually - and if they react to the tightening of Fed’s money hits as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been concluded by the German Bank Deutsche Bank’s London market research strategy Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle investigation.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its international major customers last week.
Strategies prepared by the study and the report do not believe that they know when exactly Fed will start raising interest rates or what happens in the economy and in the market.
Instead, they present economic statistics with their cool facts and calculations, how the economy and markets have previously acted at the time and after Fed’s increases.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at what the key variables of the economy and the financial markets are now at the same or different models as at the time of previous increases - and what may result from it.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more stunning condition to endure the rise in interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession, maybe not a year.
Fed’s monetary policy and its current uptake leaders have been pointing out in the last summer and the beginning of the autumn that the time will begin to be ripe to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate for over nine years can be reached this week.
The issue will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the Fed Board, so-called the Open Market Committee, meets at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds in June 2006.
At the same time, a series of relatively regular but at the same time of small 0.25 percentage points ended by Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The symptom of the financial market began in 2007 from the difficulties of the most risky housing funding in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis broke into a global nightmare of judgment.
A large recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious contradictions between the financial markets and the real economy began slower than after previous Fed's increases have typically occurred.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harder than once since the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategics have screened the rises and falls of the world's largest economies, as well as the translations of the financial markets from 1950 and from the beginning of the 18th century.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts will be cleared since the 1950s.
In the beginning of the recession, the first interest purchase has taken less than a year, mostly less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The rise in the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed's increases.
After the early 1950s, Fed has stepped up and in turn lowered its control rate to a dozen different cycles.
Each time has been different from some others, and there are relatively few times in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude any certain effects of the following increases.
The strategy reminds us that this time many things are different.
Not just better.
The interest rates are too low for too long
However, the key reasons for the financial crisis do not necessarily find out undeniably even with decades of research.
But three aspects of the causes of the crisis and its destructive power must be somewhat controversial:
1) The Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other major central banks in the world considered their governance rates too low in the 2000s.
They fixed the traces of the technocula, and at the same time raised the following.
2) In the various parts of the financial and real economy, over the decades, the amount of debt increased even more by the excess monetary policy of central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in the so-called economic history was born.
3) In particular, the insane debt finances packed in the financial economy, particularly the biggest course bubbles of financial history from shares to real estates, bonds and commodities in most areas of the financial market.
There is no doubt that the financial market that increased to the heights of more complex debts was rarely dangerous and unstable when Fed and other central banks last drove interest rates up.
The financial structures set up in the reserve of debt deposits, however, did not last until their time after the interest payments had begun and the costs of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and followed by a large recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
The Deutsche Strategies do not imagine what will happen next, but give the subject of intelligence to mention, for example, the following aspects:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been insane as it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the financial and real economy debt burden has not been reduced, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt burden has become more difficult than before or half before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from central banks to the former underground and cheaper has mostly remained in the financial market and the main types of securities and assets have slowed down the sum of the top or at any time prior to the financial crisis.
And not only the latical atmosphere, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and for decades from the most severe recession of the model as it has been before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but, accordingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are comparablely higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next steps to tighten its money flows.
Perhaps the French Bank of Societe Generale’s future image of Albert Edwards is not as strange as it may be.
He has trained international investor customers in the bank for the following full translations:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon Fedin is the time to turn off the financial fires with even greater QE cash bubbles.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are targeted by HP’s corporate service party, the company says.
HP is distributed in November to the Hewlett Packard Enterprise and consumer-oriented pc machines and printers focused on corporate sales.
HP’s staff were highest in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff were reduced to 302000.
The company records the single costs of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25000-30000 employees.
Consumer side reductions remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to low cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its business profits.
In the second year, three of its most significant customers brought 65 per cent of their profits.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system to iPhone after Apple update
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, clicking "Green" and then by selecting "The Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will allow you to download and then install it.
Some have had problems after this installation when the "Software update failed" error notification has appeared on the screen.
In order to avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update through the iTunes program.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications to get the status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that suggests removable applications and then reinstall them when the update is completed.
It is worth ensuring that the phone is loaded or close to the charger during the update, so that the battery does not end in the middle of the battery.
If the download level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to progress, because if the battery ends in the middle, it can lead to a breach of the update.

It is also worth ensuring that you have visited our list of all things that need to be done before downloading so that things do not go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they go. iOS 9 brings with you new features, such as a much smarter personal assistant and hugely new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that accelerate and correct the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the tax haven company
Anne Berner (kesk.), Minister of Transport and Communications, has been a member of the Board of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to Yle, the company’s activities were related to the so-called tax planning.
This is a Luxemburg Saltri II LuxCo company appointed by Berner as a member of the government in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Government.
Berner himself said he had left a notice of membership in May of this year.
I checked it out and that's enough for me to leave a notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control the registration chains in the agreed schedule, Berner says in the interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the Swedish Kährs Company’s ownership is managed.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner worked in Karelia-Upofloor’s government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs’ government and in Luxembourg.
According to the Yle, Kährs' ownership in Luxembourg is through a multi-step ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he received a government membership at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs in Luxembourg.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been involved in Karelia-Upofloor's government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was searched for a partner found in Sweden.
This company owned a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to take care of the benefits of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies’ capital revenues are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s ownership in the company is not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up for tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs had a capital fund in Triton for ownership already ready for the Luxemburg holding company.
Espoo opens a business-managed reception centre
In Espoon Otaniemi, the first reception centre operated by the company opens for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first hundred people from 6 a.m. today.
The number of locations can increase within a week to up to 300-400 people.
The Immigration Agency establishes the reception centre for the former Rescue College.
The activity is maintained by Luona Oy, which is a sector of production of healthcare and medical services in particular.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and the Luona Oy agreed together, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative work-life blackmail package
The STTK will prepare an alternative package for government excitement.
The organization also hopes that other wageholder centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently in the Friday demonstration.
Alternative ways to lower the price of work will be returned afterwards.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out the organization’s administration meeting for journalists at a break.
The palace estimates that the Central Economic Union (EC) is not ready for discussions.
The STTK’s economists have calculated that the security of the change contained in the Government’s Competitiveness Package will cost employers an estimated EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if the party is a huge enthusiasm to have a conversation if it is on the side of one relationship with the 100.
Fire: Negotiation connection was constructive
The Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk.) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, since the government is to give its own package a communication to the Parliament and to start preparing reforms.
The fire did not take a position on whether the timetable is realistic.
The connection to the government exists according to Palola, and it has been constructive for him all the time.
In the field of the STTK, especially the operation of Sundayians, according to Palola, is a painful place.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from mandatory legislation to implement part of the crises.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP presenting it.
Employees will meet on Friday to Helsinki to oppose the work life extortion package presented by the Government last week.
As part of the package, including the first day of illness, the salary is cut, the overtime allowances half, the Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
The STTK stresses that central organisations have invited employees to protest and have not been planning a strike.
Fjader
President Sture Fjäder thanks the STTK for preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjader, the STTK is now coming to the same lines with the Akava, as the Akava has already been further depicted as an alternative model for the government's presentations.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in an alternative package, as without the SAK package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Sture Fjäder hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will prepare the presentation as an alternative to cuts.
The STTK of Antti Palola told me that he was preparing new proposals on Wednesday.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the programme informed him that it has been preparing for a long time its own presentation, which it is ready to negotiate the 5% competitiveness of the country's government as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has always been ready to negotiate, and for a long time we have written an alternative model for government presentations.
We are ready to look at the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In response, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjader hopes that the SAK will also come to the Open Lines, as the STTK has done before Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
Now, together, we prepare a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The scheduled Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, coal, talkoot" - plays bingo while talking to Sipilä in the evening
the University of Tampere Green Left
The Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening of Viva's bingocupon.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the revolt and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy in the Yle channels on Wednesday at 21.05 p.m.
In applying for the last speech of the Prime Minister, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he took a famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the revolt of Mäntsälä.
After that, the president and the ministers held a number of radio calls during the winter and consecutive war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho, instead of President Mauno Koivisto, held a new year’s speech, but it was more ceremony.
In autumn 1976 President Urho Kekkonen stopped the strike of train drivers on television.
Solitary call, monarchist makeup
Sipila’s speech has raised criticism and assumptions throughout the day about what to come.
On Twitter, President Paavo Arhinmäki of the Left League said that "Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration of the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed."
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "one speech has already been seen.
Leadership is a dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Judges of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist makeup: the Prime Minister tells the people what's best for it".
The SDP president, Antti Rinne, challenged the Sipila dialogue: "A little for six months from the elections.
There is no unique presence from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of @juhasipila?
Public Service
According to the Government Office, Sipila’s speech is recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, the SAK president Lauri Lyly and CEO Jyri Häkämies of the SAK directly commented on it.
Yle has been criticized for the presentation of Sipila's speech.
We considered it and stated that it was part of the public service task to promote the full publicity of Finland, a line in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of the Yle publications.
Like Me Tammelos
The speech has also aroused irritations.
The evening dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be combine and dressed for their best.
Mom puts on the most beautiful collar, and Dad reconciles the tie with his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., we'll be slowed down to the TV as before at the time of Me Tammelos," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Does Prime Minister Sipilä, in his speech, also tell the reason why the Finnish government sits in tax havens that hide its capitals, which produce pardon laws for his other tax recipients and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut off when the state has the end of the money?” asked Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the University of Tampere's Green Left, Viva.
It has published a bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, coal, debts and team spirit tonight?
Coupons and pencils ready, at 21.05 it begins and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: Western countries opposed the Russian proposal for the exclusion of al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer, in which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have been renounced, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaare, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan that al-Assad would be stylishly removed after a while.
However, the Western countries did not take the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin, in a bilateral debate, listed him the plan of three points: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and the al-Assad had to be immediately contacted, and the resignation of the power of al-Assad had to be undermined.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all things, but we are able to discuss it openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said to sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what to do, Ahtisaari remembers in the Guardian interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
Ahtisaari tells me that he sent a message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate for the newspaper, but Ahtisaare said there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaare's claims, but said that the Al-Assad troops had already committed several mass murders at that time, and the main opposition groups refused all the agreements he would have remained in power.
The former leader of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Middle East, Sir John Jenkins, has hesitated Ahtisaari’s speech, since his experience suggests that Russia was in no way prepared to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaare's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's talks, I would have said that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin to take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would also have suspected that it would have been Putin's crook to hold power on an al-Assad supporter.
Refugee flow of our own actions
During the Ahtisaare negotiations, about 7 500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of death victims exceeded 220 000 in the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to escape their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own actions.
I don't see any other choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we pay the bill we made, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Reservation Center for asylum seekers in Tornio
The settlement centre for asylum seekers planned by the Government in North Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The center would be founded in the building of the building of the Torino jointly empty in the city center.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsingin Sanomat news on Tuesday that the Council had already decided to present a school building to the ministry as a spatial solution.
According to the Vice-President of the City Council of Tornion, Sauli Hyöppisen (vas.), this is not true.
When the whole delegation was not in size and part of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the Council meeting to take the decision on Monday, he would specify to the STT.
At the meeting, 36 of 43 were authorised.
The organisation centre was opposed by 13 mandates.
On the basis of this, you might expect the decision to be positive, Mr. Huppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and quickly responded to it.
There would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been inspecting that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipila still hopes that the labour market is a choice for excitement
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), the public spending would only take part in the calculation of the price of the work sought by the government.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners are able to agree on that.
Sipila told journalists that he had not contacted labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations are looking for substitutes for the excitement of working life reported by the government.
If such a contract is concluded, we will be happy to accept it as part of the package.
In the opinion of Sipila, half-saving money would work as a means, because it would target almost all payers, unlike, for example, the operation of Sunday personals by the government.
Labour market organisations could agree on the operation of holiday funds as they are registered instead of law in collective agreements.
The government will present these views to the Parliament on Wednesday next week on the crises of working life as a Communication from the Government Council.
According to Sipila, the proposals of the organisations should be known before.
This isn't the ultimate rear limit either.
Legislative work then starts to move, i.e. the train is on the move and it gets harder all the time.
It's a good time.
Not long in such matters, if there is a will, Sipila shaped.
The list published by the Government last week includes, among other things, the change of the loppian and helatorstan into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the wages of the first day of illness are cut, overtime benefits are pooled, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are implemented by forceful legislation over trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, wageholder centre organisations will arrange a major appeal on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the stock of the juice hall
The Council of Tohmajärvi unanimously accepted the expansion of the stock of the Nordic Koivu Oy Hall, i.e. juice hall.
The fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally spoken.
A busy timetable is also depressed.
It was also a little wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when it was decided on the previous extension.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock at 400-450 square meters was approved in the investment programme, but the funding will be decided in the context of the next sub-annual report.
The agenda was still discussing the investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, the Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated to be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings work and tax revenue to the location.
The municipality has no risk because the company pays the investment as a rental, Vesa Väisstö (ps.) justified.
The place of Karelia in Joensuu
The city government enlightened its previous steep position to bring cattle-speaking streets to the center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the preservation of the animal tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital city of the cattle because there are no historical grounds and the cattle language is a natural part of the area’s identity.
The language spoken in the area of Joensuu has been more part of the Eastern Savos.
Even after a new decision, there will be no cattle-speaking streets.
However, the city of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, also prepared for the use of the cattle’s language in information tables and tourism marketing.
The same approach is recommended to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is an officially single-language municipality, it is also worth taking care of the use of the cattle’s language now that multiculturalism is living and changing dramatically in North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still the specific features of the county, as well as the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be well used in the multidisciplinary marketing of the province.
The termination of train connections cuts the vitality of the county
Train connection surgery strikes the province’s vital power with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the economy and competitiveness of the province.
And it affects whether there is a chance to live and work here, the city leader of Joensuu Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also highlights the airline, which has also been on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole province that we do not have the opportunity to reduce our government measures, as it is now going on.
It is necessary to look at the impact of these terminations on employment, for example, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of traffic connections leads to an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here are, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, Director Jukka Mönkkönen of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travel a lot for research.
Recruitment director Marko Junkkarinen says that it is difficult to market the university in Western Finland already because the links are in the cross-sectional direction.
At the moment, about half of the students from the University of Eastern Finland become outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of my wars to the war of Siu
The view of the city government of Joensuu on the regional war project is apparently unanimous, but one of the sora sounds is among them.
Pentti Centralsalo, a member of the city government (sd., in the picture), presented a resignation of the entire project at the government on Monday meeting, but his presentation disappeared unprofitablely.
The Governing Board approved Kari Karjalainen's decision-making proposal, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kouvola to Kouvola will end next year
Railway traffic from Kouvola to Kouvola will continue to be maintained, although one train pair will be fewer than one train.
The passenger train traffic between Kouvola and Kouvola will be subject to changes in the next March.
One train shifter leaves out, but still five times a day from the Eagle to Kouvola and the opposite.
Supplys are due to state savings.
The purchase funds of the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million for the next four years.
The quietest routes will be completely discontinued.
VR will draw up new schedules by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys got out of the place.
The rescue facility released a 12-year-old climbed from the climb to the roof, who was not able to get down from the roof.
The situation was born in Tornionmäki on the Ketotie at 6:30 Tuesday night.
There is an old two-layer wooden house in which there are no ladders on the roof.
It didn’t stop the boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that the rest of the people were stirred from the place and the passers alarmed the position of the rescue body to help the draws of the last roof safely back on the surface of the earth.
FedEx's business profit is two, drops out the 2016 tax year prospects
FedEx reports depressive results from its latest quarter, and the shipping waste cut throughout the year after the forecast of print, as a result of deteriorating demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said that it would hire about 55,000 season workers for vacations.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 semester workers for vacations.
Its share fell by about 2.5% in the opening auction 45 minutes before the mid-week opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the tax year to end next May to $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
The analysts were waiting for $10.84, told in FactSet's survey.
In spite of the average 4.9% increases in prices, which came into force on January 4, and despite the higher additional fees in the country transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said that it expects business gains to grow from the previous year as they have cut costs, turnover has increased and online trade is growing.
The President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will “react firmly, taking into account the expected weaker economic conditions, especially in production and global trade.”
The plans for wages during the holiday were announced a day after the competitor UPS told that he was going to hire 90-95 000 extra employees, to the same extent as he hired last year.
At the end of August 31, FedEx’s result was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The win per share was $2.42, which remains from $2.44 average prediction. The 12 surveys of the analyst carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
The turnover rose by 5 per cent to 12.3 billion dollars.
During Zacks' survey, six analysts were waiting for $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered a reduction in international priority transport in recent years, which has stopped the development of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the increase in online trade has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land unit rose by 29 per cent, but the revenues of the operations were in principle the same because of the cost of the larger packages and their own insurance.
The income of the Express unit was better due to higher basic fees, while the profits in the freight industry decreased by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx’s shares fell $3.85, i.e. 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
FedEx closed 11 per cent on Tuesday for this year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
The decision-makers of the U.S. central bank will sit in two days this week at a long-awaited meeting around a huge mahogany table, deciding whether the time has come to raise the control rate for the first time for almost a decade.
In the second of the central bank’s decorative, two-layer meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Central Bank, and his colleagues, must set the financial interests of the nation above everything else.
The Congress has lowered the responsibility of the central bank: they must maximise the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, after the great disruption, the central bank’s leaders have agreed that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This third requirement can be a crucial factor in the Thursday decision, which is so strict that it cannot be predicted, and the decision whether the US economy is ready to be relocated from a record incentive that has been brought to the short-term interest rate of almost zero since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data indicates the growth of the economy stablely, recent deterioration in the global financial market may already be made more frightened by the officials of the central bank in advance, as it comes to increasing instability. It is feared how the federal funds rate would be increased even in the quarter of the percentage unit.
“The labour market and inflation are clearly the first and most important aspects to be followed,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, the Meklariliike Stifel Nicolaus & Co’s main economic specialist.
“I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for the recurrence of interest rates, increased uncertainty on the world market is sufficiently qualified to wait yet,” he said.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been reached a consensus, which already creates an alarm to the economy.
According to Bloomberg’s recent study, about half of the economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial market expects the central bank to delay the increase, as the key indicator shows that the possibility of growth is only about 30%.
This refers to a drop in the securities market if the central bank raises the level unless the decision-makers then fail to soften the attack by promiseing that the next increase will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index increased 228,89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, while the new chapter was 16 599,85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank would keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, the main economic expert of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It’s surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now,” he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, “they need to see a lot of effort in their policy to support the financial market so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts claim that the increased level would calm the financial market because it would eliminate uncertainty when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising the interest rate in this month by a quarter-percent unit, taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary economy, which would confirm the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals demand more economic development in their choices.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
Unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers as the limit for full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of boosting.
While inflation is still below the 2% annual target of the central bank, the decision-makers of the central bank have a significant temporary impact on the low oil price.
The economy "selects higher rates and also needs them, taking into account the strict situation on the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, the main economic expert of the Pantheon Macroeconomics company.
However, the financial markets around the world shocked last week when China devalved its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average index decreased by up to 16% of its record in May when investors feared China’s slowing economy would slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat in this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10% below the top of the May.
For the decision-makers of the central bank, market myllery is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells us because the interest rate should be increased.
"I have these financial market events and recent weeks of news about the weakness of the Chinese economy, the decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, Special Investigator of the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate Centre, and former official of the central bank.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers are waiting for at least a month to gain a better understanding of the impact.
“The potential impact on the US economy is still quite unclear, and they don’t have much information on the consequences of China’s events.”
International economic wellbeing is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the federal central bank has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank’s influence has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanken, the silly president of the central bank's suggestion that the central bank could "decrease" the increase in the amount of money was caused by implications on the market around the world.
In a world where the markets and economies are growing together, the central bank officials are expected not only to develop elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, the global strategy manager of Envestnet Inc’s property management company.
This month Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of the Virginia State in Richmond, pointed out that “the central bank has previously overreacted to the movement of the financial markets which had appeared to be separate from the fundamental elements of the economy.”
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions, has called for a raise of interest, and Lacker, a voted member of the Committee, welcomes the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage units during the three meetings, "notwithstanding its limited, identifiable effects on US economic growth," Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank revoked these cuts.
The central bank should give priority only during a major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England.
The last myllerrys will not be close to its level, Posen says.
“No one wants to be in a situation where interest rate increase is feared because the market becomes damaged,” says Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Law on the Central Bank (Federal Reserve Act) still holds two requirements and does not mention economic stability; as long as this is the case, I do not think they should predict it.
Do you miss a great thai store?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
This store/warehouse was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, which is often referred to as Thai-Costcona, is a thai-commerce that also sells to individuals.
Yes, it's in Chinatown, not in Thai Town.

There is even a car department in the store if you need motor oil.
The store is huge, and it takes more than an hour to circulate all the corridors.
If the trade makes you hungry, you can eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The food store inside the store (good, cheap) is close to the bags, and there are several pick-up options.
What is in the warehouse: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C is probably selling it.
Products have been priced rationally, and most of the products are sold in wholesale packages.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruits and other products.
The meat dish is wide, the same as the fish deck. The staff behind the dish cleans and fills the fish and, if necessary, shins it to you.
A large part of the movement is reserved for a huge freeze department, where you can find freezed curry leaves, hairy cucumbers and galangs, whole ducks, fish, beef meat and sapphire, porcelain leather, fishballs, local sausages, meals, and more.

Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area that it distributes with other shops and restaurants.
Even though there may be busy in the shop, the parking space is usually easy.
Brazil’s Children’s Disease Organization in Rio Grande advertises healthy diet for lactators
The Brazilian Children's Disease Organization SPRS has invented a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good food during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts that have been painted by descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give children all the nutrients necessary to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, the new study suggests that increasing the number of calories is not the only change in the diet that mothers should do.
The recent study led by professor Robert Waterland of Texas Baylor College of Medicine revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies’ genetic manifestation and protects babies from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have negative effects on the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is a favorite in viewers, despite Nine channel attempts to news the leader exploration in Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's attack on Canberra to news the post-records of the Liberal Party's predecessors failed to increase the number of viewers of today.
The nine-channel morning program was sent from the main city of the country after Malcolm Turnbull dismantled Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the week-long series of international broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara and Cancu.
The intermediate cargo didn’t seem to harm the Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise’s average was 397,000 in five state capitals, when Today’s figure was 339,000.
Today’s average grew slightly compared to Mondays (317,000) and last Tuesdays (283,000), but still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has captured Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, Today’s average was 318,000 and Sunrisen 330,000.
In the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, during September, the average Sunrise is 349,000 viewers when Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
Changes in the winds will blow this morning elsewhere than in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news of the seven channel was a 800-source series with the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing first presentation.
The new drama series, which gathered a very impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, recently reports a widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand Coast with two children.
The critics have wondered if Thomson would be the sole bearing power of the popular series without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave it real certainty.
The 7 channel The X Factor was a strong favorite of 1,136 million viewers, winning the The Block series (838,000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
The Seven Channel had two fates on the second night of the The Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe’s new visa program gathered 446,000 audiences.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers, which was small enough to win from Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night The Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewer average was 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour figure was roughly 720,000.
The average of Hot Seat was 620 000.
The Chase Australian second night's average decrease will bring the Nine confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 17.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program that failed to reduce the number of viewers of McGuire program.

The final three agrees with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who won the Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been kept extremely secret with which Sam Wood ends up in the Bachelor.
The three remaining girls are certainly not slipping out who got the last rose.
However, when we discussed with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before three became two, they could nevertheless give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three women were poetry when they told how Wood is a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positiveness for why they wanted to be his partner.
However, when they were asked, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, who should it go?", their answers could provide an explanation of who won the heart of a bachelor.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been indifferent since the first day.
"After the moment I walked in to the house, the energy and the energy of Sam seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series," said Jeavons-Fellows.
“Sarah is truly a countryside, it’s fun to be with him,” Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "this right".
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - now I'm in my whole heart here," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know how to say," he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 19.30 p.m. on the Ten channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start its NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in him after he changed to the United States, and many other teams have asked him about him after his impressive open day of training at the end of the last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coachs would have left Hayne on the exchange seat for the end of the game after this Australian rugbyliiga reverse dropped the ball in the first plane when they returned to the team when they won Minnesota on Tuesday 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Haynen to return the next flight shot and took her with her to the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real character of Tomsula also appeared in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of haunting his new enthusiasm in front of the other team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the press conference after the game.
The 49ers Special Editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the fallen ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the plane kicked off by Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
This was certainly not the beginning Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished a man to NFL-debyy.
Haynen was seen as cursed on the way from the field after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio pair band Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM channel at 104.1 that he could not have imagined the worse beginning of his NFL career.
“It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared his acidification with its original debut in 2007 when the feed in his own goal area led to the Queensland goal.
Overall, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne pose in a photo published in his Instagram account with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun threatening a civilian runway.
Hodorkovski was openly questioned by President Vladimir Putin, so he was condemned, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 killed by the police when shooting gums against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old son, died in the southern Nepal after the shooting of the police in the crowd, showing their minds against the new constitutional proposal of the country, said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmand.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that over 1,000 protesters were gathered outside the police station, and some of them were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tears and then shot the air before he turned on the rubbers.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubbers known to have been killed, but used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
In the last few weeks of violent protests across Nepal’s southern counterparts, where the members of the Madhes ethnic group say that the new provinces established under the proposed constitution will weaken their political influence.
There have also been protests in the Western Nepal when the Thrus Group requires its own state.
After the 10th of August, at least 40 people have died in violent confrontations, of whom 11 have been police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed a treaty that divided the country into the provinces - this is a big step towards the new constitution, but very controversial in Nepal, who has had a central administration for centuries.
The new constitution has been designed since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the killing of thousands of people in the destructive earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted this week on the constitutional clauses in Katmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
The US National Hurricane Centre NHC says that the Cap Verde southern has 60% chances of circular storm
A wide low pressure on the front, located about 560 km south of Cap Verde Island, is 60% of the possibility of developing as a tropical round storm in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Centre said Tuesday.
The second precision low pressure front located in the middle of the Cap Verde island group and the Small Antilles is also 60% of the chance to develop as a tropical round storm over the next two days, the weather forecast centre in Miami added.
Google will start the donation campaign with a view to collecting $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees in Europe when fleeing the wars and poor countries.
Google had an exceptional personal perspective in its publication of the donation campaign in his blog.
Instead of making a statement by the manager, his personal experience was written by Google’s employee Rita Masoud, who escaped with his family at the age of seven from Kabul.
“Our journey was a number of dark trains and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis has increased in Europe, people like my family desperately want to help.
Gifts are received by four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save children and the UN Prime Commissioner for Refugees.
Google told me that it corresponds with the same amount to every worldwide donation on the google.com/refugeerelief, up to 5.5 million dollars, so that the total target is 11 million dollars.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe has been happening since the Second World War, and is mainly due to civil war in Syria for four years, which has driven over 4 million people of their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing the war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Fatigue surgery can help mildly obesity diabeteses
According to the new study, the benefits of mildly obese type 2 diabetes mellitus may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obesity diabetesians live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than in surgery.
"The death data will take a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a weight loss surgery expert who wrote the main article in a new study in the JAMA Surgery magazine.
In weight loss, bariatric cuts, various methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects involved in the study have been sickly obese and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person’s BMI is over 30, he is considered obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers in the Tainian Min-Sheng General Hospital used the data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric transfusion and reduction of gastric bags, the medical treatments of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of cut persons fell from 31 to 24,5 to the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the people treated with other means than surgery, the BMI remained largely the same in 29.
36% of cuts improved fully and 28% partially.
Due to comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partially by approximately 2%.
In addition, the blood pressure, triglycerides and the "evil" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgery group", the writers said.
Researchers also followed the blood haemoglobin A1c levels that reflect blood sugar levels in the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, scientists write.
The post-cutting haemoglobin A1c level fell from approximately 9% to 6%.
However, in the treatment group, it remained stable at approximately 8%.
This better "glycaemic control", which is described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, says chief researcher, Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu, co-rapporteur.
The study group also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
In the fifth year, when compared with the group in the gastric reduction surgery, the group had dropped more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), lowered its weight index (7.4 and 5.1), lowered the haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%), and more likely achieved a complete diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizonan College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that even though the research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where the surgery led to longer life in more serious people.
In a Swedish study, it was found that overdoses in weight loss surgery had 29% lower probability to die during the 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not seem to improve the survival of surgery patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging to people with less than 35 BMI and are interested in surgery.
"The research results are crucial in the fact that they show that the surgery is safe for the lower weight index group," he says, and it does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at a time when the patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we wait too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to withdraw the situation.
"Everything can't come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The leader of the Buddhism of Tibetan has called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama discussed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech, which he held in the openings of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion at Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day UK visit. The center is dedicated to ethics research.
Dalai Lama argued that, in the present situation, the needs of all humanity should be put ahead of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis needs to be admired, it is also inadequate.
“Everyone can’t come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the action of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“It is great to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime, it is necessary to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslims, mainly through education.
The main thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce power use.
Power use has never solved these problems," he added.
When he asked the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's action after 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the American violent response caused severe events in the chain.
"After September 11, I expressed my condolences to President Bush in the letter and told him that the solution to this problem could be found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and it created unexpected consequences,” Dalai Lama said.
During the last four years, the swallowing of the child's hand disinfection agent has increased to four times.
Toxic data centres across the United States have reported nearly 400% increases in alcohol-containing hand-desinfection in children under 12 years of age after 2010, says Georgia’s Poisoning Information Centre.
According to the CEO Gaylord Lopez, the cases of swallowing a disinfection in children under the age of 12 increased from 3266 cases in 2010 to 16117.
"The children are interested in these products more often and unfortunately, a certain percentage of them will be put to the police," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink deliberately disinfection, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge of social media.
YouTube has videos where teenagers drink disinfection to get a cheap rise of humor.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfection with alcoholic oral water to get a stronger drink.
The smells of a pleasant disinfection may attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hands) are those that have been added to the smell.
There are strawberry, grape and orange disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant can contain alcohol between 45 and 95%.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning only requires a few injections.
"It's a really tightened alcohol," said Mr. Stephen Thornton, head of the University of Kansas Medical Nutrition Information Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave the whiskey in the table, but the hand disinfection is left visible, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently only swallowed four strawberry strawberry disinfectants in school, and was taken to care for emergency care.
Her blood levels of alcohol were .179, which is twice higher than the limit for adult riding drinks, says Emergency Clinic Doctor Chris Ritchey, who managed her at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
When he spoke to you, he couldn’t walk when he came to the emergency.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate child hospital in case of possible brain injuries, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey told me.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortori Scott told CNN.
The situation could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfection wipes and to move the disinfectant away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two ontario women died after swallowing the disinfection of their hands, which contained toxic, unreported ingredients.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a fatal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredients.
In January, in the northern part of the New York State, three fourth-class people designed to poison their "nasty" teachers by spreading bacterial poison to the classroom, the police report says.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfection and banned it from his class.
The police must prevent the plan as a "conductive foolish" and leave disciplinary measures to the school circle.
Humylly: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths shorten speeches about Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight place, but he makes it turn.
Hearts fights against the Scotland Football Union for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is guarded for January recruitments that can interfere with the unity of the team
Dons raised his lead to Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's first half penalty shot took Aberdeen to narrow win from Hamilton at the Pittodri Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the difference between Celtic and Celtic to five points.
Griffiths reduces the contradictions
There are rumors about Celtic's internal contradictions, but Griffiths immediately missed them. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under a more accurate eye when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think players are waiting to meet.
The lack of Scotland Championships is bored by Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers Central field player and former Dutch team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition with Rangers.
Ajax’s current ambassador de Boer said: “The Celtic game no longer plays the highlights and why?”
Because Rangers are not involved.
People here can't just talk about Rangers' return.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
These teams have a lot of tensions, and other than Scotlands want to follow them.
Deila swears to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn the situation around.
Lose to Malmöl and the resulting drops from the Master League quickly followed the loss of 10 men to Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the series by five points different from the next.
Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We are, too, but we must continue.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton watches for January players transfers
Although Rangers Boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible items of January play transfers, he is safe from the most recruitment, making sure that he does not want to mix the team with consensus.
The former boss of Brentford said, "The January move window is very different than the summer window."
For players coming in the summer, the time of adjustment is all over the preceding period, which will appear in our team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessarily players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest in Michu suggests retirement
Swansea's attacker Michu, whose name was associated with the transfer window in Celtic, has suggested that he can retire after his agreement with Swans expires.
A 29-year-old player has had a nipple for two years and did not succeed in finding a new company outside Wales during the summer.

Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The Red Card of the Defense was later revoked, and this was already the third red card condemned by Collum in the last eight months.
Neilson stays behind his message, saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player was forced to repent after he sang offensive songs from the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place at the pub in Edinburg, Roseburn, before Edinburg derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby and it was a moment of mind," the attacker said, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle, unless I go to Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the leadership teams to turn the situation around, but admits that the deterioration of players has to stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back," says Donnelly.
McInnes is happy about the "wrong win" in the Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately engaged in the game against Hamilton Accies, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first half penalty shot, succeeded in achieving his seventh successive victory, which raised them to the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, “There is no team that would have won anything, it was either a pocal or a league that would not have won games this way.”
Scotland unemployment remains the same as the UK’s total number increases
In Scotland, 164,000 people remained during the period between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose to 1.82 million in total.
Scotland’s unemployment rate is 5.9% higher than the UK’s 5.5%, according to the National Statistical Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12 000 people over the three-month period, and the number of people working now is 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% over the quarter, higher than the average in the UK by 73.5%.
The Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The long-term plan of administration is to build a foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made historic decision to remain part of the UK.
During these 12 months, the Scotland labour market has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has decreased.
Why do I testify to the execution of Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention, I will see later today when a man is executed.
If so, and I hope not, I will sit at the Watchers' Journal in Oklahoma State Penitentiary, watching Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses of his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to be terrified this day when I approached it.
So why did I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Suppliers, of course, have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, the participants are selected through a terrible value.
Oklahoma has reduced the locations reserved for the media to twelve-five.
Whoever you choose is looking cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip, and I have also created him through my calls made during the months of my contact, and one two and a half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and a pen to save what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One of the Octanomian journalists on Twitter accused me of my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell me the story of the prisoner in the way he wants you to participate.
I complained to the journalist.
He admits that “you could have put his word better,” but still thinks what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he said it.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants to have an international journalist who writes about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcast broadcasts I made.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't be sure to say Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, his actions would in any case make him absent.
But I think there is a very strong chance that he has not been committed to murder.
I believe there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And this is the point of view that I see him die.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who take care of it.
I give you a description of how it feels to watch the man I like dies inevitably.
The man was attracted from the Canning River after a watery police yacht
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry when he attracted a man out of the Canning River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to distract the police from his armor went wrong when he found himself in a low, mud water only metres away from a policeman who tried to “familiously attract him back to the beach.”
The Canning Vale police were invited to Beckenham on Tuesday because of the unauthorized intrusion.
When they found a suspect, this tried to distract them by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn’t get too far.
"He stood in the water, saying, "I'm not coming out, I'm coming for me," said sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to grow up, so he used safer tactics: "A proper police negotiation".
"Sometimes people do funny things when trying to escape," said sergeant Castledine.
The Master's Footballer Ben Cousins is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim over the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his business, but inspired locals to start designing a playful Ben Cousinsbiathlon.
Peter Moody claims journalists tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's operatives tried to infiltrate their stability to his deposits last year, and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He blames journalists and the Inconvenience Division of Racing Victoria, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tata's late rejection due to the treatment on the race day was the last one.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition and that he has been in a difficult situation after the unexplained positive cobalt sample of Lidar.
He has kept his tongue in control of the spies for a period of sixteen years, and he did not want it to look like jealousy.
“I wasn’t going to say anything about this, and I’ve been quiet for a long time, but sometimes it’s frustrated so much that everything will be broken off at a time,” Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with sanctions, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk upside down, and I want the owners to think I'll do my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I should no longer continue as a coach.
Then I should think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in a racing.com interview where he told me that the inconvenience department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Fourteen years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man - I'm gonna call him when I asked him and offered him a job on my deposits if he cares about what I'm doing there.
They clearly think I'm a scam.
If that's the case, they'd really need to separate their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all clear at that time and are aware today.
Should I start thinking that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become male and perhaps transfer responsibility to other than coachs about what is happening in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe people think that.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt that the things I say now might not make them think about it.
But now I'm at the point that I don't care anymore, and it mourns me.
It really mourns me.
I push them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family support, and I can turn my back on this.
The frustration of the trainer has increased through a long-term Lidar cobalt study, and the delayed rejection caused him to say that he could “throw his license over the table”.
Moody, who is best known for the training of the unbeatable master Black Caviar, has called the rules on the treatment of the race day after the mud or clay has been placed on the horse's feet, which is illegal.
“This is against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees made it mud on his leg in error.
It could have been a grave last night.
It could have been like it was yesterday.
It was on the race day.
Moody may have a three-month ban on competition due to the haude treatment of the race day, from which the participants started the study.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
Confidential driver in Cobram
The police have arrested a man who committed a traffic escape after he hit a bike in Cobram on the weekend.
A bike driver was transported on a flight to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he got serious injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and didn't stop helping the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia announced himself to a police officer in Shepparton.
He will be accused of stopping in an accident, neglecting assistance and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacks competitors in wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm's coach Craig Bellamy has criticised two NRL rugbyliiga's master favourite claims that his team's fights are part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the executive judges allowed Storm's "pain" on their own side when he suddenly won the final map in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos, coach Wayne Bennett, barely concealed his reference to Storm after winning North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night at the final map. Bennett called the game rugbyliiga's "show window" and said that two Queensland's teams were not "strongest enthusiastic" buttons.
Bellamy defended his team's fights and said they were just focusing on the "contact" in a fight.
Bellamy added that his trust increased the criticism of two leading coachs against Storm, because it means that they are afraid to lose on the team.
“This is always going to be a speech – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost to them 24-2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defense systems or techniques throughout the year. In the last six weeks we have only stressed the contact in the fights, and it has made us successful.
Trent has been in the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to be trained, so he probably hasn't used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this is always going to be spoken this time of the year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that St George Illawarra Dragons, coached by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing "cleanly".
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St. George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said that he could not care less.
But now he has a team that can play a rugby that we think is exciting, especially when he has quick young friends.
You want to play this game when you have its type of players.
He brought that side out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play it.
I'm going to be more confident when they say such things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think we were opposed to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more brilliant than the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting to rugby?
Or does it make an exciting violation of the defence line and failing to make a goal?
For me, it's about lines.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night at the pre-final AAMI Park. The tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
$200,000 warranties for a drug offence
A man who threatens a potential lifetime of a 40-kilogram cocaine-owned company in Queensland has been released against a $200 000 guarantee.
Marko Maksimovic is one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 pounds of drugs to the Solay yacht who came to South America through Vanuatu and shipped to Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting other accused boats all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovicia threatens a potential life-long cocaine holding company for business purposes, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to hold the entire amount and that he could be in the cafe for absolutely innocent reasons.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
“He has strong links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the Criminal Court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepmother were together offering $200,000 guarantees to ensure his release.
"After reading the oath of both persons, it is clear that the provision of $200 000 guarantees is a real economic burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But it was not enough to prevent him from appearing before justice, he warned.
Maksimovic was guaranteed under the condition that he would give up both Australian and Serbian passports, sign up to the police every day and adhere to his outer movement ban between 6 o'clock and 6 o'clock in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl asking for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl to sleep on this phone and then logged in to an online communication service where Hogg received numerous unsettled images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later, she noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping on Hogg's hand.
She studied her phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother about it.
When the police came, they saw five photos, studied the computers in place, and found "careful" online searches using searches used to search for unincarnated images from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to attract pedophiles on the Internet before he “failed to be a policeman to scare them”.
Mr Eilidh Robertson, the Fiscal depute spokesperson, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said that it was a addiction - that he was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had completed the tomb on the computer, but said that they were made only because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about discussions with an unknown person who sent him pictures, as well as when Hogg asked him to send more pictures.
Hogg said he was doing this just for bait.
He said after drinking, he's getting sick, and he wants to watch pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: “When the girl found pictures of his phone, she screamed, shouted and cried.
My mom saw the unscrupuled photos on the phone and then she met the accused.
She was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Ward Road, Dunde, 23-year-old Hogg, admitted his accusation of making or taking photos of unincarnated children on June 14 of last year. He infringed the warranty on January 25 of this year and left the court to court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be labeled in the sexual offences register, for it can be claimed that his crime was not a "markable sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the judgment in October so that social action has time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was given a warranty in this case, but in other cases, he was arrested prior to processing.
He was added to the sexual offender register before the date of judgment.
Zimbabwen Robert Mugabe had the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest head of Africa, Mugabe, crashed earlier this year in the leading stairs of the speaker.
He was not injured, but the video described in the crash spread in the social media as a virus.
The opposition legislators also argued that they had been sent to anonymous killing threats in which they were warned of buuaming to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they blew and interrupted him with interim lips when he held a speech on the state of the country to Parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a group criminal officer of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opponent politicians received text messages on their mobile phones that warned them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
"The name from which the message was sent does not respond, but the title of the message is "death"," Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The message warned the relevant members that immunity would end with Parliament, and when they get out, parliamentary immunity would not be valid.
The group criminal officer said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "careful" of threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has prepared to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its reorganization and cost cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, distinguishing its computer and printer business from rapidly growing business equipment and service operations.
The expected work cuts bring about $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, the HP release said.
"These reorganization measures allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, the HP President and CEO, leading the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we will have a broad and deep range of services that will help businesses move to a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the emerging needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The annual turnover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be more than $50 billion, and it will focus on producing unparalleled integrated technology solutions to companies, as reported in the company’s newsletter.
The division disrupts the company by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard graduated from Stanford University in the 1930s to produce electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, called "Pilaakson's birthplace".
HP has gone through a huge reorganization to find out the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in the field, based on the belief that firmly limited companies perform better.
Captain Mikel Arteta of Arsenal says teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed Wilshire that it is only September and assuming that he is rehabilitating according to the plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four of the following English games, and taking into account his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the next summer European championship.
The biggest pity in this latest problem is that the end of the last season in Wilshere was strong after a single scalp, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't cure properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries that he has had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted, the player attempting to return to the middle of the way there is always a risk of additional injuries.
It also has an uncomfortable model.
Studies from Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilsher has had 23 different injuries since she debytoed six years ago.
In addition, during the last five years, he has played in only 65 games of Arsenal’s 157 leagues.
Looking at the wider overall of Arsenal after the period 2007-08, in six seasons of eight, it has been one of the Valioliiga teams who have lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger acknowledges the possibility of a witchcraft, but Arsenal believes that their last year's improvement to the disability statistics will continue.
“Sometimes when you get back from the injuries, there may be a susceptible period when you need to strengthen your body and acquire competition,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will be able to do a career that he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Master's League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, playing against Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be in the beginning.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to maintain balance and give a breathing break to the players that need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up favourite of the F block, the Maksimir Stadium Zagreb is Europe's most frightening.
Dinamo has also not lost 41 matches since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign in the last season.
On Tuesday night, the Stadium was shaken by a earthquake, which was 3.2 at Richter's degree.
It was in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the last season of the Masters League to surrender against Monaco, and he is still motivated by a far-reaching dream to lead the team to its first European Cupin victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, we could be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not fantastic.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is interesting to see how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given that the need for men to open is more desperate than ever, and the suicide figures for young men are higher than for fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than women.
In the attempt to address the problem of Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the year 2015 for men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from applying for help when they needed it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study included over 2000 high school and high school students who showed depression symptoms. According to the study, the possibility of a person to recover doubled if enough a percentage of his friends were "health pleasure".
Similarly, the probability of potential mental health problems in those who were not depressed was halved if they had healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this social media communication time, the style goes out of content and the answer’s immediateity is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, even though in fact isolation is dominated.
This superficial success dominates the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this happens at the expense of internal values - personal growth and friendship of inner digging - that affects our mental health more deeply.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really won’t get more happiness.
Frendie’s fineness was just turning it to the top of this degree.
No character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly distinguished in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, the moments in comfortable chairs, watching football, Ross missing Rachel - these humors came from that knowledge that yes, men can match all of this, even though they often hesitated to study their feelings completely.
As the volunteer employee of the Samaritans organization explained to me: ..."In listening to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have really understood how small the interaction with a friend can improve feeling.”
Often, men get in touch with us experience that they can’t talk to friends.
The old idea of "extending" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up problems, you will be seen as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, external position on the other end of the phone helps people at the moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And then if you participate in Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the description sites are redesigned for the celebration, why not take your friends to the Central Perk coffee.
Or, what's better if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frendit will be sent to Comedy Central to the end of the beginning, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest'
Di Maria makes the goal and helps PSG to hit Malmo on the side
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria painted the Masters League in Debyyti, helping PSG pass the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Below the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Master League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Masters League in his debyyte paint for less than four minutes, showing the French League Championships the way, but the team lost several chances before they finally added their frontier when Cavan hit the goal for 61 minutes.
Paris, who is in the same A block with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish League Championship, for the game was not only a postgraduate, but also a improvement in their fourth-final games in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the points, it was not a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost the place in front of the goal and later replaced the field. Malmö is his old home town team and the team in which he started his great career in 1999.
"In the Master League, it's not easy to win at home or in the guest, so 2-0 victory produces problems to the opponent and looks good in the statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we're going to have to do this season," Blanc said.
This predicts good.
We wanted to win, and we won, even though I'm sorry we couldn't make one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of the three changes made after the team stayed at 2-2 planes in the Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux on the weekend, but he stayed in Di Maria's shadow for four minutes.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentinian armor was named a man who took PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why he ran Marco Verratt's feed behind the Malmö Defense Line and then hit a beautiful finish by Johan Wiland in the back of the network.
However, if someone was looking for a simple and big win from PSG, he had to be disappointed.
Malmö was a blocked opponent. It won Celtic's solution to this level, its opening field has nine international players and five-man defence and two players in the deep middle field.
But the team did not offer much more on the attack than the shot of Nikola Djurdjic on 34 minutes, which passed over the button of Kevin Trappi's paint.
Instead, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to lost feeds and bad finishing, especially Ibrahimovic, who failed in five companies only during the first half of the time, and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in the first half of the second half of Ibrahimovic contact.
However, he was much more effective in doing his pre-work to his colleagues, and just from Ibrahimovic's feed, Di Maria sent a tour, which fell around 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally received after an hour of the game after the sixth goal of the season, thanks to the Slot Cavan after Ibrahimovic had swept the Maxwell Cross Eating off the left.
It ended Malmo’s wishes to get back to the game, and only Wiland’s great fight for David Luiz’s direct kick was kept down the end numbers before the goal of Ezequiel Lavezz was abandoned at the end of the game.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team.
After that, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
We don't have enough quarrying.
I'm raising the hat to Paris.
This was a great game from them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion on stock sales
In Switzerland, the mining industry left Glencore, who suffered from the price collapse of basic goods, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt surgery plan.
The Glencore listed in the London Stock Exchange reported that it had sold new shares at around 1.6 billion pounds to shorten its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, struggles with the prices of the collapsed basic goods, while the slowdown in the Chinese economy is burdening demand and causing destruction on all markets.
The new label raised Glencore’s stock value to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday’s morning shops.
The shares increased by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pounds in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had released a $2.5 billion stock trading in the last week as part of his broader plan to cut $30 billion debt burdens on about a third.

The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
China’s President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House’s opinion was confirmed on Tuesday.
X's first official visit to Washington takes place on 25 September and is the answer to President Barack Obama's last visit to Beijing, the statement said.
The President of the United States and the spouse of the President Michelle Obama will arrange for X and this spouse a dinner for Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"Prident X's visit will allow you to expand cooperation between the United States and China in a number of common interests in global, regional and bilateral matters, while at the same time it will give President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively issues with disagreements," the statement added.
At a visit that was first published in February, Xin is also expected to depart from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet numerous US technology leaders before he continues towards New York City and the UN September General Assembly.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern regarding China's alleged online spy and the increased state's continuity in South China's controversial waters.
Matt Damon decreases the difference in filmwork
Matt Damon joined the African American filmmaker Effie Brown when they discussed a difference that Damon said he didn't need behind the scenes.
In the Sunday evening of the HBO Project Greenlight episode, an actress interrupted Brown when stressing the need for different perspectives as to the dark character of the script selected for the project.
"When we talk about a difference, it will be taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series," Damon said.
The shocked Brown reacted unbelievably, with the comments "Oh! Wow." Okay, while the Martian actress's comments remained hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly’s brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
“I want people to think about how any director is treating Harmony’s personal character,” Brown said.
The only dark character is a whore hit by his white pimp.
The Dear White People’s producer demanded the rights of directing the film to finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied very seriously that their directions “may end up giving us something we do not want.”
When the conversation was sent, the social media exploded Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger for the movie game, writes: "Matt Damon talking about the only dark person in the room and explaining her differentity is just like the light that hurts."
After its publication, Twittatus collected more than 5000 retwists and 4,000 loves.
Damon’s comments are at a time when a precise racial presentation in the media is in the interest of social debate.
After the white police killed a teenager Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement spread to the ground and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminating against colorful people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the issue when he presented the Year's album candidates as a winner of the Grammy Prize.
"Albume is still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter recently published an opinion to respond to Fox News' TV facial Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was not said that Damon was involved in it among the entertainers, producers and media mogules who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear if he has accepted the invitation or already met the Pope.
The First American Ninja Warrior Championship
On Monday, Isaac Caldier became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and rewarded a million dollars.
In the seventh season, the competition programme has never been a competitor who would have found out all the proportions of the programme's barrier.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last task was to climb around 23 metres of rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge at the time, making him the first athlete of all time, who discovered the exhaustive 4th part of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a hard win and was still shocked to win a million dollars prize.
“It’s great to think that when I’ve never earned or lived as much as $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his great wage increase.
So suddenly... I can't even imagine what this is going to be... the future is unknown.
The production director Kent Weed sat to discuss the final list with The Hollywood Reporter and why Britten won’t receive more rewards, even if he is the first competitor of all time who has managed to pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
“If more people pass, the money gets the fastest time,” Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and change life, he gets a great satisfaction feeling.
I don't think he feels anger for that.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family father.
He's a hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, “If someone had to win me, I’m happy that it was Isaac.”
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone differently.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, whose descriptions will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers Skiped Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the period has not been very funny for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers were sometimes one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last of the American League Central Division.
Tigers played his role perfectly on Tuesday when he won Minnesota at Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the opportunity to get to a player from Houston Astros in a competition from another American League Wild Card.
The game for Detroit was at least for one night returning to six letters of H, which had been very difficult to reach most of the second half of the season.
“All the wins are fun, no matter how they get,” said Brad Ausmus, Tigers’ team leader.
The Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon continued his early assault support when Detroit ran three times in the first two rounds, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) feeds 6 1/3 in a shift and released three runs.
This was only his third quality platform in the last nine games.
“I just want a strong end for this year,” Simon said.
It's hard for the exchanger to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Victor Martinez hit the Tigers in three times and allowed two runs that were his first hit after August.
This was Martinez's first three-step night after he hit Seattle Mariners four times on July 6th.
"He was doing a good thing," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in a shot training), seemed much better in hitting exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind the last half of the seventh shift, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
Sentteri Byron Buxton started the exchange pair by hitting out twice on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks returned to the right side with one nest, and Simon got burned directly by another nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked on Maueria, the only player in front of Miguel Sanoa, who started with the only player in front of Maueria, who pulled two nests on the left of the right hand Drew Verhagen.
While the two runners on the field and the matching runner on the second floor, VerHagen got the third base of Trevor Plouffe's double-playing landscape.
It was a record of the main series: 27 times this season when Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had received a security run at the ninth start, Mauer had two hit-off Tigers shutters against Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned the saying in three feeds in the fifth salvation.
Detroit used Phil Hughes in rust in the beginning.
Tigers got three runs in the first two rounds against the right-handed veteran player, who got out of the injured list before the game, after over a month of lower-length inflammation.
“It’s obvious that I didn’t want this beginning,” Hughes said, “but when the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt that I had made a few nice feeds on the third round.”
After Hughes grabbed the start beam to the first nest, he gave another nest player Ian Kinsler a move between one.
Walking at the right side of J.D. Martinez, in the situation of two fires, led Victor Martinez, who took himself to the first base of the middle field and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 pipe when he runs in good runway stations.
Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and causing the second run, but the threat ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned when he tried to move to the third floor.
Tigers continued on the second round and got one fire, two in the nest situation abductor from James McCann and two fires, one in the nest situation of the center Anthony Goselta, and then the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important hit," said Twins team manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in the feed readings and feed a non-stop third pair, after which he became a right-handed prolonger A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs from six hits and walking with four fires.
Note: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers' right-hand feeder, got out of the throw-hand shoulder because of the stretch.
He was investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured people since mid-August, due to the wing of the shoulder, but he had to return on Wednesday.
When Sanchez is outside, the left-handed feeder Daniel Norris will be on the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics on Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after the left-handed feeder David Price was switched to him on July 30th.
Norris has been out since August 20, due to the stretch of the right muscular muscle.
The three game series of Tigers and Twins ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) sets up against Minnesota’s right hand feeder Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi asks to open the economy more widely to the world
The economy must help the outside world to promote growth, and President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday, whose task is to guide the reform.
"Kína should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policy," he said at the 16th meeting of the Group leading to deepening the general reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as the reforms are progressing on increasing new movements and vitality, and creating a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access restrictions, the degradation of border inspection principles, the insulation of state-owned companies to capture private capital, and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list of sectors and companies that cannot be invested in is created.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through experimental programmes.
The change is significant because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures the legally based business environment and makes the markets more transparent, the opinion states.
The government also degrades its management to the power it distributes to companies, ensuring that companies decide on how they manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for development of regional growth.
In order to open government-controlled sectors to private finances, more sectors will be opened.
"The administration does not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the opinion said.
In addition, the search process of permanent residence permits for foreign residents, "green cards", will be facilitated by optimizing the requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the rights of professionals of lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as by senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, in the opinion published after the meeting.
