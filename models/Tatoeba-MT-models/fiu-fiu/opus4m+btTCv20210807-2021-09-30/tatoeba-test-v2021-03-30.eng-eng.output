He's not a good cook.
Tom said he's not in any hurry.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
I didn't know you weren't Canadians.
Come to watch us play music sometime.
Tom said he understands why Mary doesn't want to do that.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do that today.
Tom told me he'd complain about that.
Tom is a member of my apartment co-op.
Tom drove down the street Mary lives, hoping to see her.
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know as well as I do, there's no chance Tom's gonna do that.
Tom was not sure if he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I know Tom might have to do that by himself.
Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he's supposed to do.
It would have been tired of doing that.
Tom must have told us the truth.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
We have to do something.
When are you going to do that?
Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week.
Tom knew he would be punished.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone do that before.
It's not hard.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.
Tom told me I should learn how to play the drums.
We have not yet succeeded.
I've never been to Paris.
Tom said he had eaten nothing, but that wasn't true.
I'm an atheist.

Tom said I looked a little pale.
Tom told Mary that he should stop pretending to be confused.
Tom thought Mary was alone.
I know Tom's hiding something from me.
Did you know that Tom didn't start playing the guitar until he was thirty years old?
I wonder if Tom knows Mary wants to do that.
I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary went on October 20.
I know Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why is everyone staring at us?
I know Tom didn't know who did that to Mary.
I think Tom did that because everyone else in his family did.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary didn't know how to play the oboe.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank you.
I would have left early if I could.
I know I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you'd enjoy doing that.
Tom hasn't talked to Mary about that yet.
I don't think Tom is handsome.
Tom was the only one who was sleeping.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't asleep.
I should never have let you go home alone last night.
I think I'll have the chance to do that the day after tomorrow.
Tom said you were really good at tennis.
Tom told me he thought Mary was autistic.
Tom would have wanted to go to Boston with you.

Tom said he was desperate.
Tom said I don't have to do that this afternoon.
Tom said it was a good time to leave.
I know Tom's scared.
You can't appreciate the poem until you read it many times.
I deliberately did that.
Tom should never have left early.
She's already married.
This is a blasphemy!
Tom said he thought Mary was not awake.
Tom said he was glad he could do that.
You can't buy one of those for less than $30.
Do you think Tom would like to go to Australia with us?
Tom said he liked dancing with Mary.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary couldn't do that.
Tom must have seen us do that.

I hope I haven't forgotten anyone.

Tom has already been told about the problem.
I know Tom was disobedient.
I don't know anyone who hates Tom.

Where is your notebook?
I don't think I'll be as early tomorrow as I was today.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
How many kilometers is it from here to the railway station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often adopts the behaviors and speech patterns that characterize the advantages.
Tom said you were his friend.
I'm thinking about having dinner at six.
Tom told Mary he'd do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's over.
Tom said Mary's dog bit her.
Tom said he was through doing that.
Tom said he was appealing to his suspension.
He is deeply attached to him.
I thought you'd show me how to do that.
I'm telling you, we have to assume Tom's dead.
Mary has a hairdresser appointment.
Tom said Mary thought she might be allowed to do that today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like someone's been smoking a cigarette in here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I think that question is not appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a kid?
I don't think anyone noticed what we were doing.
What are we going to do?
I could have cryed.
There's no free lunch.
I thought you said we weren't going to Boston with Tom.
Tom's quit smoking.
I think I know what Tom's doing here.

Did you give Tom the key?
Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him he had to do that.
My father is a doctor.
I don't think I'd like to be married to Tom.

I know Tom doesn't know Mary needs to do that.
Everyone here except Tom and Mary have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was satisfied.
Tom said he was going to help us do that.
Tom's house is very close to my house.
The host cut the turkey for guests.
I know Tom doesn't know that he really doesn't have to do that.
I think Tom will be able to understand that.
I haven't decided yet.
I know that's not worth it.
Tom told me he thought Mary was rude.
It's not wrong.
Tom and Mary told me they felt offended.

What are you trying to do?
We didn't know if Tom and Mary were busy or not.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to go.
You better take your shoes off.
I didn't think we were doing anything wrong.
Everyone knew Tom didn't want to do that.

I'd like to do that.
It won't be so hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do that by himself.
I was so excited!
Tom is a party animal.
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party.
Tom will probably have to do that today.
I hope I don't have to do that.
Tom must have changed a lot.
No one is better at this than me.
As soon as I saw Tom, I could tell him he was angry.

Tom said he'd be thirteen next month.
I wish I was on your side!
Get your pants off of me.
I'm afraid I have to refuse.
I know you recently retired.
I knew Tom would be happy if you did that.
I wonder if we're really gonna do that today.
Tom's sleeping.
You're a good boy.
I should have just walked in.
I don't think you've been listening to me.
We are a brother and a sister.
I don't think Tom's done that.
I don't think we've done anything illegal.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before.
Haven't you got a TV?
Don't give up!
I don't play mandolin as well as you.
Tom said he thought Mary might not be required to do that anymore.

There's someone waiting for you.
They said they were ready.
Tom and Mary said they felt lightheaded.
You know you shouldn't do that, don't you?
Nothing has been done.
Let's make sure that doesn't happen.
I know Tom knows why we couldn't do that for him.
Tom said he thought that could happen in Boston too.
I didn't know Tom was an anonymous.
I think Tom would like to be the next to do that.

I just want you to consider the possibility that you are wrong.
I'm sure I didn't say that.
Tom said Mary thought she might be required to do that next time he travels.
I am as happy as I can be.
If they knew what was going to happen, they would have changed their plans.
I know Tom didn't know he didn't want to do that.
Tom's rich, but he's not as rich as Mary.
Go wake up Tom and tell him that breakfast is ready.

The bus arrived 10 minutes behind time.
Tom is not home right now.
Tom said he liked skiing too.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this matter with you.
I think you shouldn't have done that by yourself.
Tom said Mary thought she might not want to do that until it gets cooler.
I didn't think Tom was annoyed.
Tom said he didn't know Mary had done that.
Tom said he was quicker to do that than Mary is.
Tom and Mary told me they felt hot.
I didn't know Tom was supposed to do that by himself.
We split the loot in three ways.
I don't think Tom could do that by himself.
Tom told me I was pretty.
What time will the show begin?
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow.
Tom's probably not going to yoking with Mary.
I don't think Tom knows who did that to Mary.
All three of my brothers are older than me.
Tom said he didn't know if he could do that.
I know Tom couldn't do that.
Keep left on the next traffic lights.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom loves Mary.
Tom doesn't need Mary's help.
Tom and Mary say they're lonely.
Were you afraid of the first time you were on a plane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
I am disappointed in my son.
I don't think I did very well.
Do you think there's a chance that you'll do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There is a big supermarket.
I suspected Tom was discouraged.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said he knew Mary might not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure no one can see us?
There is no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom might not have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Has he been in touch with you?
Tom and Mary said they'd do that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today is the 20th of October.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to go.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's not Canadian.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have kids.
I know Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I don't think that book is so interesting.
I was told that that's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team will continue to get better.
I wish someone could help me with that.
Tom definitely knows that he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom's going to be there.
It is a big responsibility.
I think you should turn yourself in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom worked together.
No one will know I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed more exercise.
Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary thought she might be required to do that next time he travels.
I knew Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she shouldn't do that.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they were not coming back.
Tom doesn't know Mary's in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom's worried.
I wish I had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom was going to be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
Tom said Mary thought she might not have to do that by herself.
Tom said he probably wouldn't win.
It's possible Tom may not know that I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows everything.
Tom said it won't end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today.
I thought we had something to give Tom.
The pupils did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't mind doing that.
You will remain here until you are summoned.
My daughter is trained toilet.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling fine.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something's happened to him.
No one suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
I didn't know Tom and Mary were married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they've never met you.
I think Tom is a pretty good painter.
I know Tom is a picky eater and rarely tries anything new.
Tom says he didn't do anything illegal.
I suspect Tom knows Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know Tom knows how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
He's still chatting away.
You're a geek.
Everyone was late except me.
He could not resist the temptation.
Tom will probably get angry if you do that.
I assumed Tom would agree to do that.
I'm a liberal.
May I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom's gonna have to do that alone.
He wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing is not as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted he was rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should talk about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know Tom is a little older than Mary is.
Tom didn't know someone was hired to kill him.
Tom told me he can't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that.
Tom said he thought I might not have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me that he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know Tom is a bully.
He's the smartest boy.
How's your father?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom won't be jealous.
I'm pretty sure that wasn't what Tom meant.
It's not gonna be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired of him.
I doubt that Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he had never planned to live in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
I know Tom is about the same height as you are.
There is no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said he's glad Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if he'd read the book that he'd lent him.
I woke up at 7:00.
I could have done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't told anyone they're getting married.
They said they were planning to go on Monday.
It won't be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't talk so fast, please.
They told me they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone they had to do that.
I think Tom paid too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worn out.
Tom told me he thought Mary was busy.
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should have stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me he thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could have kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew that I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary's not awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to annoy me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything he sets his mind on.
We married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could have done that better.
I know Tom didn't do that right.
He's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary is better in French than he really is.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think Tom would have done that?
That's his house.
I'm home.
You don't need to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should have tried harder.
I thought Tom was going to do that today.
They promised they'd check it.
I'm sure Tom would have agreed.
Tom and Mary said they don't like doing that.
Tom said he knew that he might have to do that by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there is important.
Tom must have put up a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance Tom might get hurt.
Tom said he was glad you did that.
I always knew Tom was a troublemaker.
Well, I never!
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to win.
I'm a student, but he's not.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary was going to do.
I wonder if Tom is really homeick.
Tom and Mary said they can't sing very well.
Tom said he thought Mary was good in France.
Tom says he will always love Mary.
I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
I wish I was someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just wanted you to know that I support you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We are all in grave danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I just had a hard-boiled egg for myself.
Do you have a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary will probably not be able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said they like this time of year.
Tom wants Mary to know that he can trust him.
They say they declined that deal.
I know Tom didn't know you couldn't do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
I know Tom is a very close friend of Mary's.
I know Tom didn't know who to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wouldn't do that?
I know that Tom would probably agree to that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans to do that.
Tom could have asked me first.
You don't really suggest that I go out with another girl, do you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should.
I don't think Tom is bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why he didn't do that.
I would have done that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary that he thought John was not hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that.
Tom and Mary swore they would never hit me again.
Tom said he should have stayed in Australia longer.
Tom said he knew they might not allow him to do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should have left before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I already told Tom I had to do that.
I plan to stay at home all day on Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom's amused by what's going on?
We have not yet begun to fight.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they were supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me they were ambidextrous.
Tom said he thought what Mary did was a mistake.
I hope no one comes.
I thought everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said he thought Mary was in his bedroom studying.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Tom told me it didn't matter.
I know Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I'm twelve.
I'd forgotten about that.
Tom told everyone he was through doing that.
They thought there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were happy.
I thought you said you were glad you didn't do that.
Tom can speak a little French.
I know Tom is a lot higher than me.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that this will happen.
I knew Tom wasn't busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom is quicker than Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary might not be required to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everyone's having a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
Tom thought it was difficult.
We've walked around the lake.
I don't think it's going to be hard to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom is as rich as most people think he is.
You won't do that.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been thirty years old today if he hadn't died last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know Tom knows I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom is safe.
I know Tom didn't know he shouldn't do that here.
Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like doing that.
I don't know how this could have happened.
You're as tall as my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about it.
I think Tom has done enough.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that he was the one who stole Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told they had to do that.
We better tell the others.
Why are everyone talking about Tom?
Federer held love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them to do.
I know Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You're a very naughty boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pilaf with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning on doing that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have an e-mail.
If something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.
Tom said he hopes you don't want to do that.
Tom said he wished he hadn't been there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in any hurry.
We may need to be in Australia for several weeks.
I wasn't going to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said he was expecting Mary to participate.
I swim every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They pretended they didn't know me.
I know Tom is a little shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know Tom and I are not going to do that, are you?
Tom and Mary told me they finished doing that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have turned left back there.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought maybe you wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he had forgotten something.
He does not like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's got a lot on his plate right now.
I knew Tom knew who had to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
It is not possible with current technology.
They said they were trying to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he's not allowed to do that.
I assume you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
You have a sense of humor.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think he's over 40 years old.
Can you cook an omelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk anymore.
I wonder if we could do anything to help.
Tom said he'd be willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom can do that.
Tom didn't know he had to do that by himself.
Tom is dating a girl who is three years younger than he is.
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I know Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think Tom will like this wine.
I think we spoke on the phone.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There is a certain amount of truth in what he says.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom is a slob.
He is not a virtuous.
I suspect Tom lied to me.
Tom will eventually have to do that.
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30.
Tom has not yet told Mary what to do.
I know Tom is a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should have stayed home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed all of us.
He is not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he was planning to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends aren't here.
A wolf cannot be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he should have done.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't be paid.
Are you worried that could happen?
I know Tom doesn't know Mary did that.
Do not forget to take your umbrella when you leave here.
I'll see what's done.
I wear a suit, but I don't wear a tie.
I'm as tired as you.
Tom thought he might come down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized right away.
You're lucky you didn't get injured.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
Are you sure Tom will do that?
We cannot live without air.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary has always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows something we don't.
Tom said he was worried about Mary.
We all got in the car.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that or not.
Last night I puked.
Tom's not very good at bowling.
Tom said Mary gave him something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary was going to be mad.
I don't think you've been paying attention.
We will need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing.
Tom said Mary's gonna do that tomorrow.
You're both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe Tom's actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We are all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that anytime soon.
Have I ever told you about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was thirteen years old.
Tom said he wished he hadn't played a shack with Mary.
I know that Tom will probably give you permission to do that.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that by himself.
I wonder if Tom is motivated.
Tom said he would have done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like it if Mary did that.
I still wish you'd do that.
Mary, let me know that she wasn't planning on staying very long.
I didn't know you were going to be jealous.
Tom didn't know Mary had children.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom might be lonely.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't busy.
I'm absolutely sure that won't happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary is going to do that.
Tom and Mary say they need to find someone to help them do that.
You're very annoying.
I've already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom would not be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You've finished your homework, haven't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not.
I'm lost in the forest.
I know Tom's a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me he'd be in Boston next Monday.
Keep your mouth shut!
Tom said he knew he might have to do that on Monday.
Tom said he regretted what had happened.
It’s never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary he had to do that.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
Do you have a pen on you?
Tom let Mary do what he wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents won't let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it will take him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried on his father's clothes.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary why he did that.
Tom said he's been trying to do that all week.
You have really beautiful teeth! Are they real?
No one knew that Tom was the person who contributed most of the money.
Everyone knew Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was frustrated.
Tom and I were both a little confused.
I'm sure Tom knew that would happen.
Tom told me he thought he could do that.
I admitted I did what Tom said I shouldn't do.
Did you know Tom and Mary had three children?
It's not just a minor problem.
I am not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom's done that already.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should have done that.
There must be a reason Tom's not here.
It's not right to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me that he thought Mary could run faster than he could.
Tom said Mary's scared.
You should have been the last to do that.
I know Tom's a farmer, but I don't know where his farm is.
Tom says the matter is urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like doing that.
What could go wrong?
No one could have stopped that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
I know I said I'd do that, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom is overemotional.
I am immune to smallpox.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my couch.
My class was canceled.
Tom and Mary told me to be gone by the time they got here.
Tom promised me he'd be here by 2:30.
Tom said he thinks Mary can take care of himself.
It's not as cold here as I expected it to be.
Tom said he just got back from Australia.
I don't think I'll be alone.
I can't work now.
The game is about to begin.
Tom said Mary was born in Boston.
I don't think Tom's gonna be surprised.
I know Tom would be willing to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was jealous.
Does anyone else know you're here?
Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo.
Tom said Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know that Tom wasn't planning on doing that?
I know Tom knew who would do that for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said he didn't think the noise was bothering Mary.
No one ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knows that we did.
Tom said that he thought those shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he knew he might not have to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said that he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried Tom's gonna get lost.
They told me they were next.
I suspect Tom and Mary are not as eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't ticklish.
I know Tom just did that to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We are sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they ate too much.
He's old enough to drive a car.
Tom said he thought he forgot to lock the door.
I know Tom is afraid people might laugh at him.
Tom said Mary was probably still mad.
Tom and Mary say they feel better now.
They hate foreigners; I hate everyone.
Tom said he's not sure Mary can swim.
I don't know if Tom will come tomorrow or not.
They said they were very busy.
I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
I think Tom is the only one who has to do that.
I didn't think you'd win.
I don't think Tom will have time to do that with us today.
I know Tom is very opinionful.
We can't let these upstarts push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew Tom knew who could do that and who couldn't.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom's not so sure.
Everyone here knows we don't eat pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
I've already told Tom I'm not planning on doing that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It's not healthy to skip meals.
I'm so pleased to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I suspect Tom and Mary were the ones who did that.
I bet I can sit here longer without saying something you can.
It's not done yet.
I know Tom's not on the team anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that.
Tom just turned on the radio.
Tom has already decided that he will not say yes.
I know Tom is a little snobbish.
What's in the box?
Tom said Mary knew she might not want to do that by herself.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said he would have done that by himself if he could have.
Admitting that there is a problem is the first step to solve the problem.
Mary said she was planning to go.
Tom told me he thought Mary was missing.
Tom said Mary lied.
I don't think Tom would be upset if I did that.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't be there.
They said they thought I could win.
Tom is mean to everyone, isn't he?
Tom is not really in Boston now.
I hoped to get an email from you today.
I thought Tom was unpressed.
Tom is no longer a suspect.
There's nothing here.
I thought Tom didn't do that well.
I knew Tom would do that right away.
Why didn't you go to Boston?
Tom said he's not going to do that again.
Tom said that's what made him very happy.
I realize that Tom could get Mary to show us how to do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary's gonna say yes.

I know you're not planning on staying in Boston.
I wonder if that could happen again.
I suspect Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I couldn't help looking at it.
I think Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French.
The evidence currently available does not allow me to make such a claim.

Tom said he wanted to talk to you.
I thought you were a doctor.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.

Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom thought you could take care of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
Tom has decided he's not going to work today.
Tom denied that he was the one who asked Mary to do that.
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't be caught.
It won't work out.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said that Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom told Mary and I that we should try to do that by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I couldn't have done that without your help.
I knew Tom didn't really want to do that by himself.
Tom said he's looking forward to his retirement.
Whether we do that now or later, it doesn't matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should've anticipated Tom's not getting along with Mary.
I think it's very unlikely that Tom was not aware that he would not be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
I wonder if Tom really knows the combination with this safe.
Someone's singing.
Mary's not gonna do that until I tell her.
I didn't know you were supposed to do that this afternoon.
Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.

I think Tom is thirty years old.
Think about it.

I didn't think anyone would like Tom.
I thought Tom might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.

That's not something I know how to do.
I think I can fix it myself.
I didn't think anyone did that.
Tom said we'd get lost.
Tom said he should do that.
Are you sure Mary said she was planning on doing that tomorrow?
There were times I would have been lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom told me he thought Mary was crazy.
Tom already knows Mary did that.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really have to do that.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
It won't end well.
I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote in all caps.
Tom will be very happy he didn't do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that alone.
If I were you, I would go home at once.
It's not like you knew what they were going to do.
Tom and I are planning to stay together.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
So what are you suggesting?
Tom said he learned something new.
I know Tom's married.

That's very good.

Tom said he felt insulted.
Tom knew Mary would win.
Tom and Mary said they don't want this.

Tom's fine.
Tom said he thought he didn't have to do that.
Tom said Mary knew she might not want to do that until John had time to help her.

I hope to see Tom tomorrow.
How much water does it take to fill your swimming pool?

You know that must be done today, don't you?
I think Tom's about to start crying.
He took him by the arm.
Tom said he felt intimidated.
It's not worth the effort.
Someone's waiting in your office.
I'm sorry we dragged you into this.
Tom said he's not thirsty.
Tom told me Mary did that wrong.
I knew Tom might get hurt if he tried to do that.
Isn't that what you would have done?

It will be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.

I assume this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I always suspected Tom was a little paranoid.

You should have been able to do that much better.
We work every day but Monday.
I know you weren't the ones who did that.
Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it.
I know Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he'd probably cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one there who knew Tom didn't want to do that.
I very seriously doubt that Tom did that for purpose.
I thought you might be busy now.
Tom said that we should do that by ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about it today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something the other night about that.
Tom admitted he was not brave.
I know I should have done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
I suspect Tom is waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't bite.
I don't think Tom is as crazy as some people think.
I don't think I can do that by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
He avoided his eyes.
Tom's not as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that by ourselves.
Tom says Mary is still planning to do that.
I thought Tom must be mistaken.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should have introduced myself.
Tom said Mary is looking forward to being retired.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never fallen in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about it.
Everyone likes Tom.
I didn't think anyone thought you were crazy.
He hasn't got a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that by himself.
No need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I think Tom's involved.
How many pounds have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are fine.
I'm a devastating human being.
I will never forget the time you and I went to Australia together.
Tom is not the only one who plans to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary both decided not to leave.
Tom told me he was sleepy.
Mary tried her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted he stole Mary's bicycle.
I sneaked off the lid.
Tom said Mary would probably be in Australia now.
Tom said he didn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you are.
When is your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would have helped you.
I didn't know Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun doing that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been on a diet for more than a year.
Tom said he was not willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary already had a driver license.
I know Tom is a pretty good drummer.
Tom realized that he could not change anything.
Tom said Mary should have done that alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weather vault.
Didn't you know Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I think Tom's home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they'd do that again.
Tom threw up.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to be married to Tom.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned.
Tom didn't stay in Boston for as long as he wanted.
Tom said he was a Canadian.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
I assume Tom is still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone he knows enjoys doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know Tom can probably do that sometime today.
Do you let your children play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the desk.
I think Tom is unkind.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is it true that Tom is moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I am interested in shacks these days.
I don't think I'd like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary should have done that by himself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was misled.
What you're saying is absolutely wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary was thirsty.
They said they didn't like doing that.
I'm peeling apples.
They said they would never study French.
They said they thought I was creative.
Tom told me he's not sure what he should do.
Tom told me I should have said yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There was nothing left in the fridge.
Tom said he knew Mary might not have to do that.
I knew Tom probably didn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know Mary couldn't speak French very well.
I don't think there's any chance I'll get there on time.
I think both Tom and Mary will be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he's not planning to go with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom's sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everyone loves free stuff.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I will.
I know Tom's still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they were ready to help me.
Tom's not the one who told me Mary should do that.
I thought you said you'd still like to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary wanted to do that or not.
They say they're not planning to go.
Tom's a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom said that it was Mary who told him that he should do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary's annoyed.
I don't think I can hold on much longer.
Tom's not as tall as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat was bothering Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom I disagreed.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I already promised Tom I'd help him.
I think everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me he couldn't be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to pay attention to that.
Tom said he knew that Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom said Australia is a nice place to visit.
I thought Tom was in big trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted for three hours.
I wonder if Tom is alive.
I might try to borrow a hatchet from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anyone would want to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I don't think Tom's going to be in Australia very long.
Tom told Mary he'd never come back here.
I didn't know you couldn't do that by yourself.
I suspect Tom will never agree to that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is irresponsible.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know that Tom is more likely to do that today than he was yesterday.
I think Tom's doing something illegal.
Our streets flood when we have rain.
I'll probably be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have much choice.
Tom said he thought he could do that on October 20.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was going to do that.
I knew Tom might be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has an idea what Tom is capable of.
Tom knew he could have done that better.
Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do that by himself anymore.
Tom told me he thought Mary was displeasing.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a student.
I think Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've made enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know Tom's the one who's supposed to tell Mary that he needs to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by myself.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that won't happen.
Tom is planning to sit in the back.
Tom said he gave Mary a book.
It would have been unbearable.
I know that Tom will probably know how to do that.
I know Tom was a scrawny kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly to blame.
I'm not surprised that Tom plans to do that.
No one expected Tom to win.
Don't twist my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job was going to be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put your jacket on if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary he was not planning to stay in Australia very long.
I hear you gave up smoking.
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes doing that much.
Tom might be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said Mary knew John might have to do that by himself.
Tom said he was good at speaking French.
This is not salt.
Has anyone seen Tom here?
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room I do.
He did not keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he was planning on doing that.
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know Tom can speak French better than I can.
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary was careful.
Tom was asleep on the living room sofa.
I found out both Tom and Mary like romance novels.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I think Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone he was ready to do that.
We'll go on a picnic if it's okay tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone
It's not Tom who needs protection, it's Mary.
They said they were irritated.
I think Tom will probably be able to do that.
Tom did that whenever he could.
They said their houses were not for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I think we have more important things we should do now.
I think Tom and Mary have been to Boston at least once.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that he should stop pretending to be sleepy.
Can someone please help me?
I know Tom is about the same age as your daughter.
I know Tom is a very lucky guy.
Tom thought I might not be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's easy.
I think Tom will be lonely.
It looks like Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary has to settle in her new flat.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you're gonna do that.
They swore they would never do that.
Everyone stood there, shocked.
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I'm sorry I wasn't as careful as I should have been.
Tom doesn't look too good.
Tom said he thought I should do that by myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows if Mary is sleeping or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did that, weren't you?
They wished they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I've seen Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like doing that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary by now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't just assume Tom is guilty.
Watch yourselves.
Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Someone has to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know Tom did that when he was thirteen.
Tom said he didn't think you could win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him.
That's enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I had to do that.
Did you know Tom did that?
I think it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It is not until you have lost your health that you realize its value.
That could have hit me.
They told me they're losing weight.
My house is not big.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know I was still planning to join the team, did you?
The bathroom was not very clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he never thought he could convince Mary to go out with him.
Tom thought Mary would be the first to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ambitious.
This is something I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music.
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's been ill for three weeks.
Tom said he wished he could speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom hasn't got a prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know Tom knew I was the one who had to do that.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I did a bad thing.
I think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I promised Tom I would do that.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's too good to be true.
Tom said that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to be obedient.
Courgettes are green.
I should never have broken up with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom threw his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that.
That's just not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
Tom says he and Mary will spend Christmas together.
Why did you fail in the entrance examination?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says he can't prove Mary did that.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were bored.
Tom said he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really mean.
I know there will be a lot of good food in the picnic.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I suspect Tom is reluctant to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd rather come next week.
What are you referring to?
Tom said he thought Mary was pleased with what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same thing.
They are inseparable.
Tom didn't know that you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must have done that last year.
Can you take a picture of me?
We should have expected that to happen.
It would have been wise to do that.
Tom told me he didn't have a problem with that.
Tom said Mary shouldn't have walked home by himself.
Tom must be irritated.
How long has your head been hurt?
Thank you, bud.
Tom said no one was fired.
Do you think we should have gone to where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
He's got earache.
I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said it was Mary who told him he had to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
I assume that the gunshot I heard was the one who killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.
I know Tom is a millionaire.
Tom said that he thought it would be safe.
I don't think I'm gonna let Tom do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit I've done that.
I think Tom doesn't eat meat.
I hope we don't have any problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the noise.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom is a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I think Tom's not the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom's downstairs.
I need to know that we can depend on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought she might not be allowed to do that.
I realize that is not likely to happen.
They say the drug is not safe.
I know it's very unlikely that anyone can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitive person.
Tom said he thought it would be a huge mistake to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom thought Mary would probably not cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That would never have happened if you had done what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heater.
Does anyone have a cleenex?
Tom told us that he thought he could become a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom is a hemophilic.
I wouldn't have said anything.
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and I are both wrong.
I assume you still enjoy drinking beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary could do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the person you should talk to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to study French.
You're not obliged to do that, are you?
You have a big head.
He's very smart.
I would never have hired Tom.
Does Tom know you've done that already?
Tom ate more than I ate.
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom said Mary is probably still willing to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said he thought I'd want to do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
I hope this is enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early anymore.
I know Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary are going to get hurt if they're not careful.
Tom would have done that.
I didn't know that Tom told Mary he wouldn't do that.
I'd like to visit Boston again.
By teaching and studying my time is taken.
I think Tom is concealed.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that.
They say they're going to quit doing that.
Tom is incompetent.
Tom thinks Mary drinks like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary said they told you.
Tom said he thought Mary couldn't do that.
I know Tom's a golfer, maybe he could teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew Tom could do that without some help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter.
What else are you going to do?
I think Tom understood everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom is talkative.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I assume you'd like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary got back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary good night last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew Tom was not a bad student.
It's unlikely Tom's gonna do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campsite?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should have quit while I was ahead.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmother texts are faster than you.
Do both Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you'd do that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone noticed what you were doing.
I wonder if I could help Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know this isn't hard.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I assumed Tom had told you I would be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week?
Tom said he didn't know that eventually Mary was going to leave him.
You're not afraid yet, are you?
I thought you'd cry.
The value of health cannot be overestimated.
You will suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it will cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know Tom's nice.
Tom already knows Mary's planning on doing that.
Don't take off your gloves.
Keep it up!
Tom said he was not going to do that again.
Tom should have been able to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary felt sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put on your pants.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know Tom's not the one who's supposed to do that.
I admit I've been despised by Tom since I first met him.
Are there many Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the TV guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It is true that the earth is round.
Tom couldn't help smiling.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak French well.
Check out that girl.
Tom told Mary that he should stop pretending to be handicapped.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
Tom thinks that's a mistake.
I knew Tom was a reasonable guy.
Tom thought Mary was downstairs.
I didn't want to admit I couldn't do that.
Tom said he was ready to do whatever he needed.
Tom said he owed Mary a lot of money.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat dinner with you.
It's not safe to go out after dark by yourself.
Did you know Tom had a son?
Tom knows Mary likes Boston.
Tom and Mary said they're not likely to win.
Tom told me he was forgiven.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows there's only one way of action possible.
Tom and Mary said they tried very hard to win.
They say they lost their keys.
I've decided never to do that again.
I didn't know you were dating Tom.
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary they don't have to do that.
Good job, guys!
I know Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to do that today.
Tom and Mary say they didn't want to do that.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
Don't you know everyone's talking about us?
Tom said Mary knew she didn't want to do that until next Monday.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think Tom is sad.
I don't think Tom will really win.
I would have wanted to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was strict.
Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that by himself.
We wish we could have done more to help.
Tom said he thought it would be snow tonight.
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
Tom said he'd look at it.
Tom said it was more difficult than he thought it would be.
You would have loved the movie.
They told me they don't really care what happens.
Tom's speech wasn't as long as Mary's speech was.
I didn't know Tom would be willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
Everyone seems to be afraid but you.
Tom was afraid that his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything.
Was the book you read yesterday in France?
I'm a damage dog.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could have gone.
Tom said he didn't think the smell bothered Mary.
He thinks I'm in love with him.
I thought you were a better shack player than this.
I'm glad to see Tom is happy again.
I thought Tom had already left.
I knew Tom couldn't keep Mary from doing that.
I don't think we have much time.
Tom said he's trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would have done that for me.
Tom is the funniest person I've ever met.
I doubt Tom really plans to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might not have to do that this week.
I know Tom knows he didn't have to do that.
To tell the truth, I am not your father.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that to Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, isn't it?
I thought you might walk Mary home.
Tom said he hoped Mary would try to do that.
You like chocolate, right?
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.
Tom says he knows Mary can't speak French very well.
Tom hasn't told me where he's going to stay in Boston.
Tom didn't have to come here.
They said they enjoyed the challenge.
I know Tom was late.
Tom told me he was going home.
Tom told me he lost his textbook.
No one knew Tom was going to do that.
That's right!
I thought I might have to do that.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't have any siblings.
I think Tom was the one who wanted to do that.
I suspect that won't happen.
I wonder if Tom and Mary really tell the truth.
Do you all think this is a good idea?
It must have been broken during shipping.
They said they might not win.
Tom said he thought Mary was a good cook.
They haven't admitted they did that yet.
Everyone except Tom knew he didn't have to go to Boston.
I knew Tom knew why Mary had to do that yesterday.
I know Tom is someone we can trust.
If I could have spoken better in French, I might have gotten that job.
Are you feeling okay today?
Tom and Mary said they could do that.
These turtles are not native to California.
Tom told me he thought Mary didn't want to go to Boston.
They said they were Canadian.
I know you feel grateful.
I know Tom is a prison guard.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do anything John asks him to do.
Tom said he hoped he could buy what he needed for $300.
Tom said Mary thought she was the only one who had to do that.
Both Tom and Mary joined the army when they were eighteen.
I knew Tom knew who did that for Mary.
Ya hafta smells the roses.
Tom said he didn't like dogs.
Tom told me he thinks he'll win tomorrow.
I'm really tired of living.
Tom thought Mary's dress was not suitable for that occasion.
Do you have children?
Tom said he's glad he didn't do that.
I wonder if Tom is really done.
I don't think anyone can do this.
Did you know Tom and Mary were still planning on doing that?
Tom told me he thought Mary was too young to drive.
I'll come back.
I don't think Tom's noisy.
I would never have done that.
I believe that we do not really need to do this.
Tom could have been faster than Mary if he had tried harder.
I knew Tom told Mary he wouldn't do that.
In my opinion, you're wrong.
Tom told me he thought Mary was deaf.
I don't think I'm going out today because it's pretty cold.
Tom certainly made it clear that he did not want Mary to attend the party.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to do this.
Tom said he wished he had not forgotten to buy Mary a birthday present.
I wonder if Tom would like to play poker with us.
I don't think anyone can do that.
I thought we were already over this.

I'm your friend, right?
Has anyone told Tom?

Let's celebrate!
Tom told Mary that John was in Australia.
Tom told everyone he was discouraged.
You should have told Tom about it while he was here.
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be polite.
Can you think of anyone who would have wanted to kill Tom?
Tom said he thought he could do that for me.
I thought you said you enjoyed doing that.
You could have drowned.
Tom told Mary that he was glad that would happen.
We really need more American slang on Tatoeba, stat!
Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to go with us.
I know Tom would have done that for me.
I don't think the weather will clear anytime soon.
Tom and I both like swimming.

Tom told me he hoped Mary would be gone by the time we got there.
Tom pretended he didn't notice Mary staring at her.
Tom thought he had to help Mary.
I'm going to New York next week.
This is an unusually difficult language.
They realized they needed to do that.
I'm sure Tom has to do that again.
Tom must have been tortured.
Last night I puked.
Everyone here except me has done that.
Tom is almost as tall as Mary is.
Tom told me he thought Mary was upset.
We need to protect our children.
I assume you've already read this.
I don't think you should do that until this afternoon.
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give him.
I thought Tom didn't like you.
I was surprised that Tom didn't have to do the same thing I needed to do.
I thought Tom was likely to win.
I can't help laughing at him.
I don't think I really have to do that.
I know Tom is a heavy sleeper.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
It was the first time I visited the museum.
Tom said he hoped Mary won't let John drive.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
Why are you planning on doing that?
I'm sorry I couldn't get to you sooner.
Excellent!
We're sorry it happened.
I didn't realize Tom was doing that.
Tom is about three years older than Mary.
It's important that we do that correctly.
I think Tom's just pretending to be asleep.
I promise I won't cry.
Tom said that he thought I might not be required to do that by myself.
I think Tom is frustrated.
Tom and Mary told me they needed some cash.
I always knew Tom could win.
You're welcome.
Tom showed me his stamp collection.
We're here.
Both Tom and Mary don't speak French.
What you said doesn't make sense.
They told me they'd join us later.
I suspect Tom and Mary will hate this.
Tom said he wished that Mary and I wouldn't go out after dark alone.
We could not see the top of the mountain.
They told me they'd be back soon.
You should have done that without Tom's help.
Someone's waiting for us in the lobby.
I knew Tom was going to tell Mary to do that.
I've lost three pounds.
The same thing must have happened to Tom.
I know Tom is almost as tall as I am.
Tom didn't read everything as carefully as he should have.
We know that Tom is unlikely to do that.
I knew Tom was going to this school.
I'm afraid we'll have to start over again.
I'm so sorry this has happened.
That's an interesting claim.
You were not surprised that I didn't have to do that, did you?
I am familiar with this subject.
I don't think anyone really thought Tom was as rich as he said he was.
She's not old enough to get a driver's license.
His dream has become reality.
They promised that they would do that tomorrow.
I think both Tom and Mary were born in Australia.
Why do you think Tom would do that?
I can go out if the rain goes up.
I don't think Tom enjoys touring.
Tom could have been present at today's meeting, but he didn't want to be, so he wasn't.

I should have paid more attention in the biology class.
Tom said he thought he was too young to do that.
You're not taking it, are you?
Is there somewhere we can talk privately about this?
I guess I could try.
They are not like people say they are.
I don't think I'll be busy next week.
I don't think I'm the person you're looking for.
I am far from happy.
I don't think Tom has any friends in Boston.
Both Tom and Mary complained about John.
I know you're not serious.
Tom said he'd never heard of me.
Tom said he didn't think Mary knew how to drive.
I never said that!
Have a great weekend.
I think Tom and Mary have both left Australia.
Tom thought it was going to hurt.
It's not much worth.
It's really hard.
Tom will be surprised if you don't do that.
Tom knew Mary was with John.
I promise I'll be back soon.
Tom said Mary shouldn't have stayed at the party so long.
They put their boots on.
I thought you came to see Tom.
This should have been done a long time ago.

I do not say words.

I thought Tom was hungry.
Tom thinks if he had tried a little harder, he could have won the race.
Tom's lawyer was not surprised when the jury found him not guilty.
What's the real reason Tom didn't want to buy that?
Tom assumed everyone at school knew he was arrested.
It's not something I'm very good at.
I thought it was true.
So valuable were the books that were handled with the greatest care.
You should have declined the invitation.
I didn't know Tom told Mary he couldn't do that.
I know Tom is a teacher here.
Tom thought he'd forget to tell Mary what to do.
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't happy.
I understand no one wants to help us.
Tom and Mary told me that they thought I should lose weight.
I know you don't know either.
If you want this pen, I will lend it to you.
I know Tom doesn't know why you didn't do that.
I think it would be hard to do that.
Tom told me he thought you could do that.
Tom doesn't know that Mary was the one who did that.
I know that Tom is a little higher than I am.
I don't remember!
I should have been a movie star.
Tom said he hopes you won't go home by himself.
Tom told me he thought Mary used to play a lead guitar in John's band.
If it were possible, someone would have done it by now.

It's not easy for you, is it?
Tom could have been responsible for what happened, but I don't think he was.
Tom knew I was uncomfortable.
Tom told me he'd be back soon.
It's obvious Tom wants to do that.
I think it's a risk that anyone would have taken.
I'm sorry I forced you to do that.
I thought you said you'd rather do that yourself.
Tom said he thought Mary would be afraid.
Tom doesn't want Mary to know he doesn't know how to do that.
Tom said he had done that.
Tom should have told Mary that he was doing it the wrong way.
Call me!
You should have told Tom how you felt.
We will consider your suggestion.
Eating too much is bad for health.
The paint is drying.
Tom may be lost.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is.
Hi, my name's Tom!
Tom said he never wanted to get married.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would have done that.
Tom is still dating the same girl he was dating three years ago.
You're not getting away from me that easily, Tom.
Tom will give us everything we have asked for.

You're a drug addict like me!
I don't think I deserve it.

Thank you for coming.
I doubt Tom will leave anytime soon.
Both Tom and Mary will go.
I thought you said you'd ask Tom to do that.
Don't hang up!
I probably sing better than Tom.
Tom is miserable.
Didn't you know there was a good chance that this would happen?
I wonder if Tom will be at Mary's party tonight.
Tom is the only one in our office who doesn't speak French.

I know that's gonna be hard to do.
Tom must have missed something.
I know someone had to do that.
Tom said he hoped he could win.

Tom didn't know Mary used to live in Australia.
I wonder if Tom still thinks Mary has to do that.
I'm going to send Tom a birthday present.
I don't speak French as fluently as you do.
Tom has given me many things.
I know Tom didn't know why you wanted him to do that.
They said they were not sure what to do.
I should have listened to you.
Do you have a umbrella I can borrow?

Tom said he's not sure Mary can take care of himself.
Tom lived in Australia for three years when he was a child.
I doubt that Tom really plans to do that this week.
Is it true that Tom tried to hang himself?
Who are you calling stupid?!
I'm calling my brother.
There's a good chance Tom's gonna do that for us.
I knew Tom wouldn't hurt me.

Forget it.
Tom said more than he should have had.
I thought Tom wouldn't like the book Mary gave him.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't do that today.
Tom wasn't the one who told me Mary didn't want to do that.
I hope things remain peaceful.
I can rip you apart with my bare hands.
I thought Tom might be angry with you.
I don't think Tom's Mary's boyfriend.
Tom said he thought he should do that.
Tom and Mary told me they were safe.
Tom thought he heard his name being called.
We don't think that's true.
This is a song I learned when I was a kid.
The road is long.
Tom's a good carpenter.
Tom said Mary would probably be in Australia next Monday.
It's gonna be hard to do.
I thought I'd try it again.
Tom will be very disappointed if you don't eat the salad he made.
We're both from Boston.

You lied to him!

Are you hungry too?
I doubt we were ever in any real danger.

I don't think Tom's coming to school today.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants him to say.
Is there any chance you could help me get them?
Are you sure that's what you want to do?
I know someone who can do that for you.
I thought I heard a mouse in the kitchen.
I know Tom wouldn't make Mary do that.
Tom put his glasses on.
There is nothing God can do.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't impressed.
I thought about it a lot.

Tom had no desire to return to Boston.
Mary made her husband breakfast.

Know yourself.
Don't say anything.
I would have done it at that time.
Tom and I are both a little busy.
Tom told me he left his wife.
It's probably gonna be hard for Tom to win.

I don't think it matters who does that.
I didn't know you were going to do that today.
Why is Tom mad at Mary?

Tom helps anyone who asks for help.
I know Tom is a member.
I really doubt that Tom will be here.
That book is very old.
None of us are planning to stay here much longer.

It's not very windy today.
Tom won't be here until 2:30.
Tom is the only one I know who has been to Australia.
I promise I won't tell anyone what you did.
They put on their swimsuits.
Hurry up, Tom.

If you were there, we would have had a good time together.
Tom said he was not happy here.
I'm at a loss for words.
Tom and Mary said they liked that.
Tom and I are both a little busy right now.
They said they felt manipulated.
I don't think Tom would be motivated to do that.

You should at least have told Tom and Mary that they didn't have to do that anymore.

Let's go to the park where it's not noisy.

I'm starting to remember it.
If I had the money, I would buy this computer immediately.
We're already on it.
Tom and Mary said they'd make it on time.
I don't think Tom knows how well Mary can speak French.
Tom told everyone that he was glad that would happen.
The price of rice rose by three percent.
They say they have been asked to help.
Tom knows he has no choice.

I know Tom didn't know you had to do that.
Tom is already planning to do that.
Who's the photographer?
I knew Tom was a gun owner, but I didn't know he had so many guns.
I didn't understand.
I'm lucky I can still do that.

Tom's gonna go too.

I pray.
Tom told me he thought Mary was satisfied.
I don't think Tom knows the whole story.
I don't think Tom even saw me.
Put on your shirt.
The same for me.
I am the first musician in my family.
Some people say that true love does not exist.
I’m not very good at shaking people up quickly.
Tom told me I could use his computer.
The first person I met in Australia was Tom.
Everyone but Tom knew he didn't have to stay in Boston.

This man is not my husband.
Tom said he didn't believe that.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't want me to do that.
Tom must have been very tired when he got home.
I'm pretty sure Tom can't speak French.
There is no chance Tom will help us.
I don't think you can eat that.
Tom said he'd try to do that.
I thought it was funny.
Tom works in a store not too far from where he lives.
I thought you said you didn't want to talk about it.
I don't know anyone there except Tom.
Tom told me he was faster than Mary.
I don't think Tom's still upset.
Tom told me he thought Mary was fired.
It's not a bad plan.
Did Tom know you were planning on doing that?
Tom convinced me you were the best person for the job.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't do that for him.
That water is not cold.
I think Tom stayed in Boston last summer.
How anyone could vote for someone like that is beyond me.
They said they were busy.
I know Tom's in his room packing his suitcase.
Do you really think you can convince Tom to buy you that?
I don't think anyone saw us do that.
Tom said you were speaking French.
I should have gone to the dentist last week.
They told me they were shy.
I don't think Tom is adopted.
I swear I'm not high.
Tom and Mary gave me their old car.
Tom said he hadn't seen Mary for a long time.
Both Tom and I know you did that.
Tom told Mary I was broke.
I know Tom and Mary were both sick.
I don't understand why anyone would want to do that.
Tom said he was interested in learning how to do that.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary what to do.
They still hope they can do that.
Tom said he jumped out of the way.
"With anyone with you?" "No, I was alone."
Don't pretend you're sorry, I know you're not.
Tom told everyone he was reluctant to do that.
This box is quite heavy!
I thought you said you wanted to go to Boston.
I met someone yesterday who knows Tom.
I know you can't get away with this.
Whenever someone knocks on the door, my dog starts hacking.
Both Tom and Mary have the same problem.
There's no way you can do that by yourself.
I'm afraid something's wrong with Tom.
The bill was hard to calculate.
I want to know who's coming with us.
I've never met anyone like you before.
It would have been hard to do that.
Tom may be ready to do that.
Tom will try to help Mary do that.
It could have been worse.
Tom thinks that doing that would not be a good idea.
I'm sorry I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Tom and I both didn't go to yesterday's meeting.
Why didn't you come to the party?
Do you think Tom is already retired?
I wonder if Tom still remembers how to do that.
Didn't you know that Tom used to live in Boston?
I don't think it'll rain, but I'll take a umbrella in case.
Tom promised he would tell us.
Tom said he thought there was no need to hurry.
Both Tom and I are still high school students.
You're making a big mistake.
Tom says he saw a ghost.
Tom thinks Mary's not going to be lonely.
Tom and Mary said they would help.
Did the umbrella you found belong to Tom?
Tom should have done much better.
I know Tom is almost never at home on Monday.
I think Tom really hates you.
I know that Tom will like to do that by himself.
Tom said he'd retire next October.
I didn't know Tom played the trumpet.
Do you think it'll rain this weekend?
I know Tom probably didn't do what he was supposed to do.
I don't remember asking you to do that.
There's no way I'm gonna let you do that.
Tom told everyone he was lonely.
I wonder if Tom is still busy.
What is our CEO's name?
I know you're worried about Tom.
I thought I did pretty well.
Tom admitted he was troubled.
No one could hear what Tom was saying.
Tom said he would visit Mary in Australia next summer.
They're welfare queens.
Not everyone is ready.
There will be a storm.
Tom must have been skeptical.

Let's get our photo taken.
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
Suddenly all the lights went out.
Tom and Mary said they'd probably win.
I think Tom would be annoyed if you did that.
Tom and Mary thought they'd find other jobs.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
I think Tom and Mary were planning to do that tomorrow.
I didn't know you knew how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I know Tom's doing that well.
Tom said nothing had changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know Tom knows I had to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know Tom's afraid he'll be fired.
If I were you, I'd call the doctor.
I wasn't very hungry.
I've done everything you've asked me to do.
Do you have a tie I can borrow?
I didn't think we'd find anyone who could do that for us.
Tom is not an angel.
I think Tom's mad.
That sounds awesome.
Tom's driving over to Mary's apartment to give him something.
Tom said he thought Mary would wait.
Tom said he didn't think the smell bothered Mary.
Tom said he was willing to do that for us.
Can you believe Tom is only thirteen?
Tom sent Mary his picture.
Tom already knows Mary's not going to be here today.
They say they've never eaten Thai food.
I think Tom and Mary have never been to Boston.
They're playing sack.
I thought I heard someone sing.
I heard Tom planning to move to Australia.
It's not as hot here as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I belong here.
No one saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he might win.
Tom had no problems with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know you're not misleading me for someone else?
You should have refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm beginning to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom should never have been released in prison.
His train arrives at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said that Mary thought that John might be required to do that by himself.
I know what I would do.
He didn't need to bring the umbrella.
Both Tom and Mary were not at home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I need to do that today.
Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
Tom told me you were with him yesterday afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know that we were the ones who were supposed to do that.
I am so tired that I can barely walk.
They felt they needed to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but don't speak.
You set up a trap.
I should have added more salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary were married.
I think Tom is smashed.
Tom and Mary say they'll never do that.
I think Tom's sorry.
You were skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could have gotten home by himself.
Both Tom and Mary know who you are.
Mary said she's not planning on doing that by herself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were unpressed.
Tom has not yet told us what he needs to do.
I know you probably didn't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remembers where we first met.
If only you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he was expecting Mary to get back to Boston on October 20.
Tom said he thought he might have to do that again.
Tom thinks you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I knew Tom told Mary he couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize they're being ignored.
If Tom had left at 2:30, he would have been here by now.
Tom and Mary said they would do it.
There is no doubt that Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom has decided to stay in Australia for another three days.
Tom said he thought I seemed unconcerned.
I should have stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I could do that.
I thought Tom would panic.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder if it'll be snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom is happy.
I'm cooking fish.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that by now if he was really planning to do it.
I know Tom could do that if he really needed it.
We'll never know.
Tom admitted he had killed Mary.
Didn't you know your taillights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom will never hurt anyone again.
I learn Esperanto very quickly.
You're not going to get in trouble to help me, are you?
I've heard that women spend more on shoes than men.
I think Tom will be excited.
We'll land in 15 minutes.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do whatever he wants to do.
I thought you were going to fix that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told that he will not be allowed to do that.
They say they're unsure.
I know Tom didn't know he couldn't do that.
Tom should have told me earlier.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men apologized to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John's gonna do that.
They say they also need to do that.
I know Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they'd help me.
I don't think I'll ever be able to afford to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they're snoring.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tom said he found something.
Business is not a charity.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had ever been to Australia.
I don't think Tom is as good-looking as John is.
Tom said that the prices at that store were too high.
I don't think anyone disputes that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he hoped he could do that today.
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was uncomfortable.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know Tom is not afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without some help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
No one asked me if I liked it or not.
Many old people today can’t keep up with the times.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he decided to do that.
It's a kind of cat.
Tom probably thought Mary would refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
Tom refused to accept the bribe.
Tom said that he thought that would not be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
Can't this wait until morning?
We'll land in 15 minutes.
We know that won't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his throat loudly.
I think Tom is unpredictable.
I'm afraid I've lost it.
Tom said Mary was likely to be grumpy.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they used to be.
I know Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do that today.
Don't talk about business while we eat.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard.
I hope Tom is adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She's got to be taken to the hospital.
I would have helped you if you had asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
This is not a drill.
Tom should have done that a long time ago.
I think Tom slept all afternoon.
I wonder if Tom is upset.
Tom said he knew they might not let him do that at school.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes that.
Tom would have done that for Mary if he had more time.
I don't think you really have to do that.
Something is still not right.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I know Tom's not planning on going to Boston with you.
Tom said he's not sure Mary has to do that.
I didn't think Tom could talk Mary into doing that.
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know you didn't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said that he thought it would be fun.
I think you'll find out it was Tom's fault.
I thought it was pretty genius.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were the ones who did that?
Are you still planning on doing that with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know when you said you'd be there, but I couldn't be there at that time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that's not true.
Let's assume that will happen.
Tom told everyone he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was true.
It's quite likely that Tom will come.
I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
I didn't think anyone had tried that before.
You should have made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning to go.
Tom said it looked like Mary had a really hard time doing that.
I'm learning old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could have done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard to get along.
They said they were very drunk.
You could have told me earlier.
Tom told me he thought Mary was concealed.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know Tom will never do that anymore.
Tom says he swears only when it is absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom's high.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me that he thought this book was interesting.
Tom assumed everyone knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he was planning to go on October 20.
They said they're doing just fine.
The hostiles continued between the two powers.
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everyone else in his family did.
I would have done that if I could have.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Tom assumed everyone at school knew he was arrested.
Tom wished he knew how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he saw Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to be able to do that.
I think Tom's the one who's supposed to tell Mary to do that.
Everyone knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My findings suggest that is not the case.
Tom found the watch he had lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Someone must have left the window open.
I know Tom is a messy person.
I'm sorry, sir, there must have been a mistake.
I know Tom knew Mary was going to do that.
Tom was just stating the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know Mary was not happy.
Tom said he could do that in a few hours.
No doubt that you will be able to pass the examination.
Where's everybody?
How have you been?
Fortune favors the brave.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom heard us.
It's not mandatory.
I hope no one comes.
What color was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do that for them if they could find someone else to do it for them.
Tom said he'd walk Mary home.
It's gonna be hard for Tom to win.
We should have hired someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unpressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me he was too tired to study.
Where's your bag?
Both of my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that's not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said he thought Mary could help him do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's a chubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom will be willing to talk to me.
Tom said he was glad Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you could get Tom to do that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, much less German.
Tom thought something bad would happen.
I thought that's what you would have wanted.
I know it's very unlikely anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I both enjoy playing volleyball.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit he's wrong.
Tom said he was unable to win.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that soon.
There's a chance Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It is not enough to know only one language.
She's a blonde girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing Mary did.
I know Tom is a sophomore.
Tom definitely knew that he shouldn't have eaten that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that until Monday.
Tom should never have tried to do that by himself.
How's your father?
My son is not a snob.
I would have let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was harder than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary wanted to do that alone.
I wonder if it will be really hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said Mary knew she might not have to do that again.
They swore they wouldn't do that again.
I'm not really going to do that.
I know Tom will allow you to do that.
Tom said Mary would do that.
They said they wouldn't do that.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said he thought there was a good chance Mary would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary wasn't finished doing that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know Tom could actually do that.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would.
Tom said he thought Mary was over thirty.
We went up by two floors to reach the garments.
I don't think Tom is funny.
Tom thinks he's going to die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they'd be happy to help.
Tom and I both want to go.
I didn't know you'd tell me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I could do that for Tom.
Tom promised he would never make such a mistake again.
Don't you think we should have talked to Tom about this?
Tom told me he thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me that he thought Mary still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the little stuff.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it was a very common problem.
Are you sure this will work?
I'm afraid I'll be tied up all afternoon.
I know you can hear me.
You seemed unwilling to do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought he was doing it wrong, but he didn't care what he thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first time offender.
I promise you that won't happen.
Tom said Mary thought she might have to do that.
Tom said he would never try to do that again.
I don't think it ever worked.
Do not forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom has given me a lot of things.
I know Tom is a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom admitted he lied to me.
Tom and Mary have told John they're not planning on staying home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We're not quite sure exactly what we're supposed to do.
We both love Tom.
Tom said that he hopes you'll try your best to do that.
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that tonight.
I don't think I know the man who's playing the drums.
This old man has liver spots on his skin.
Tom and Mary swore they would never do that.
Give me that candle.
Tom didn't seem to be aware of what he had to do.
There is no time to explain.
Tom didn't realize he had to leave.
They said they were afraid.
Tom and Mary say they can't find their hats.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
Tom said there was still a lot of work to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassed.
Tom said he thought he was going to be arrested.
Tom and Mary told me they were gone.
I have heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to see Mary anymore.
They live in a fantasy world.
They said they thought I was charming.
I didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you'll have a lot of fun doing that.
I suspect Tom doesn't do that as often as he used to.
I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to do that.
I'm gonna skip lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was afraid.
Tom has already told me that he has decided to go to Boston next summer.
That doesn't make sense.
They say they're dying.
Tom offered to lend me some money.
Do you think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea Mary didn't know what she was doing.
Tom told everyone he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom is a native French speaker.
They said they were not planning to go.
They say they taught French.
I suspect Tom and Mary are curious.
I know Tom knows I don't have to do that.
You have to help Tom.
Tom told us he had a headache.
The bomb was defused just minutes before it exploded.
Tom and Mary told me they'd win, but they didn't.
I'm glad to hear it!
Tom and Mary say they don't know any French.
I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that.
You should have refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't approve of Tom dating Mary.
Tom said that's not the main reason Mary should do that.
Tom doesn't have a car, neither does Mary.
I'm a cat.
I know you're not doing that anymore.
Tom said he was no different.
Tom admitted what he said was wrong.
Tom could have been afraid.
Who do you think asked me to give this to you?
I've just been sick.
I hope I get a raise.
Tom said he didn't think we should even consider doing that.
Tom said he would have come if we had invited him.
I don't think I'll probably do that.
Tom said he might cry.
It's Sunday.
Tom told me he was not tired.
I didn't think anyone really thought Tom was busy.
I think you know we have to do that today.
I didn't think Tom would do that.
I knew Tom would leave early.
Tom said he thought Mary understood French.
Tom said he needed my help, so I helped him.
I don't think anyone lived in this house for a long time.
Tom refused to steal the money.
Tom said he hasn't decided what he's gonna do.
Everyone knew Tom didn't like going to Boston.
Tom said he thought tomorrow would be a suny day.
Tom is obviously drunk.
I'm absolutely sure that won't happen.
Everyone was there except Tom.
I thought you promised to give it to Tom.
I thought you said you saw Tom this morning.
I think Tom was supposed to be here.
Tom and Mary said they were fully recovered.
I didn't know you weren't planning on doing that by yourself.
I don't think there's any way out of here.
There is no rose without a thorn.
Tom thought Mary probably didn't know that John spoke French.
You know I wouldn't do that.
I think we all know that's a bad idea.
I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
Tom was probably about thirteen years old at the time.
Tom and Mary said they were tickling.
Tom said he couldn't help the garden today.
I wonder how Tom knew I would be here.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was mean.
So, where's the problem?
Tom didn't think Mary was beautiful.
He will have to do that task again.
I know Tom didn't know anyone who could do that.
Only fresh vegets are sold here.
I don't think this is a good idea.
Tom has already been asked not to do that.
Here's your change.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
When was the last time you asked someone to help?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny.
I know Tom is irritated.
I didn't meet anyone new today.
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I knew Tom was going to do that.
Tom and I both don't speak French.
I thought you were ready.
I know Tom knew why Mary didn't like doing that.
I didn't think Tom was glad that happened.
They said they were very tired.
You're not old enough to get a driver license, are you?
I don't think there's any harm telling you now.
I thought you said you did that on Monday.
Everyone here knows Tom is in Boston.
Tom denied that he met Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Austria is a parliamentary republic in mid-Europe and consists of nine Bundesländers.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They said they're not thirty yet.
I didn't think Tom really had to do that yesterday.
I thought Tom was back.
Tom said Mary knew she might not be allowed to do that unless John does it with him.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were happy.
Tom said Mary thought John might be required to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I thought Mary was cute.
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to do that by himself.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy.
Did Tom say he stayed in Australia?
Tom said he'd pay for everything.
They told me they weren't alone.
I don't think I can finish the job alone.
Tom said Mary's not safe.
Tom said I looked thinner than he last saw me.
They said they'd see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was concerned.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's gonna do this afternoon.
Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be cooperative.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary will be afraid.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
I knew Tom would show Mary how to do that if he asked him to.
We can't pretend Tom's normal.
Tom's amusement.
Tom should never have tried to do that alone.
Tom and Mary said they would never do that.
I'm higher than him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was a conservative.
Tom said Mary probably wouldn't want to do that on a cold day like today.
The teachers' room and gym are under renovation.
Do you think there's any chance you'll be able to do that?
Tom put his glass down.
You'd think that would impress Tom.
This is the first time I bought a newspaper in this city.
That's a good question.
Without water, we cannot exist.
Tom understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.
Tom and Mary said they were not willing to do that.
I know Tom will be able to help us do that.
I had lunch three hours ago.
Tom said he appreciated Mary's help.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
You are the only one who can protect them.
Can someone explain this to me?
Did you know Tom was going to be in Boston all week?
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
I know Tom didn't know I was not going to do that.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom has a lot of things he needs to do.
Tom and Mary say they're not sure they're ready.
There is no logical reason for this.
I suspected Tom was intoxicated.
I hope I gave you enough money to buy everything you need.
Tom said he didn't think Mary enjoyed doing that.
They said they were feeling fine.
I wish you hadn't seen me do that.
Tom and Mary said they didn't have any money.
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that.
Tom should never have gotten that job.
Tom told Mary that he was his one and only.
Tom knew he wouldn't be expelled.
Tom was convinced Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said he knew that was what Mary had to do.
I think you're terrific.
I wonder if Tom's going to Boston next week.
Tom said he didn't know Mary wouldn't go to Australia unless he went with him.
I know Tom doesn't want to do that.
You're not an idiot.
I don't think Tom wins very often when he plays a shack.
Tom said he didn't know Mary couldn't speak French very well.
Tom said he knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said Mary wasn't mad.
I think we bought everything we need.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom is average.
You're not just working for Tom.
Tom said he knew that Mary might be required to do that by himself.
I don't think Tom knows how it happened.
It's not a watch.
Tom and Mary said they were fearless.
I'm from the United States.
I don't think Tom knows how to have a good time.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
Tom seems unwilling to correct his mistakes.
I loved that book!
Tom said Mary wouldn't like to do that.
Tom said he felt safe.
Tom's homesick.
Did you know that would happen?
I think Tom believed me.
I don't think we can do that by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary would probably not do that.
I thought you said we weren't gonna do that anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who can do that.
I'm pretty sure Tom has a girlfriend.
I thought you might be the only person who would listen to me.
I know Tom didn't know Mary didn't do that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be nervous to do that.
That's the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me they were ambidextrous.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped buying a chocolate bar.
I really doubt that Tom will be excited about that.
I didn't know I was supposed to help Tom do that.
No matter what you say, I'm convinced I'm right.
Tom said he didn't need any more help.
We cannot make changes in our schedule.
I was shocked when I heard Tom was arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they shouldn't park there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not really going to kill Tom, are you?
They said they'd be willing to help us.
Tom told me he was doing that.
Tom is not the same as he was thirty years ago.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this today.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary to do that today.
America's Civil War lasted four years.
They say they're disappointed.
It is not always easy to distinguish good from evil.
Tom said he'd try something he's never done before.
I don't think Tom is strong.
It's not too hard.
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
I suspect Tom and Mary are suspicious.
You're a bride.
Tom said he would have done that if he could have.
I don't think anyone really wants to do that.
Tom said he wished he'd kissed Mary good night.
If you do that, I will.
I think Tom is irreplaceable.

Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't done it.
I suspect Tom will probably have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not as busy now as I was this time last year.
I would have talked to Tom instead of ignoring him.
I thought you'd like to meet my family.
