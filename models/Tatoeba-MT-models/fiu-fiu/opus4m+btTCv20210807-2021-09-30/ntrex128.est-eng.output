Members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to look like Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have been embarrassed by the recommendation to convert their title to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Wales Parliament).
The theme has begun from the plan to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
The representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this can lead to laughter.
One member of the National Assembly of Leiborists said that his groupmates are concerned because they are ripped with the words “Twp and Pwp”.
For an explanation for readers outside Wales: the word daft in the kõmri language means poop and pwp means poop.
A member of the plaid said that the whole group was “not happy” and has offered other names.
The member of the Wales Conservative Party said that his group would be “responsive” to the change of name, but noted that the word “MWP” is very similar to the word “Muppet”.
To explain: in kõmri, the vote of the star w is similar to the vote of the English of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the National Assembly, which currently draws up a draft law on the change of name, said: “The final decision on all the names in which the members of the National Assembly are invited will, of course, be made by the members themselves.”
The Wales Government Act 2017 granted the Wales National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public survey on the proposals relating to the name, under which the idea is widely supported to rename the National Assembly as the Wales Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘Wales Members of the Parliament’ or ‘WMP’, but the participants in the public survey favoured the most variant ‘MWP’.
Members of the Assembly are likely to offer other names, but the agreement may be a challenge for President Elin Jones, who should present a legislative draft on amendments in the coming weeks.
The Act of Reform also includes other amendments to the principles of the National Assembly's work, including the rules for the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee's system.
The final vote on the appointment of the members of the National Assembly will remain to the members of the legislative debate.
Macedonians organise a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country as the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum will be held in order to resolve the dispute with Greece, the neighbouring country with its province of Macedonia for decades.
Athens has long argued that its Northern Neighbourhood’s name represents the requirement for this territory and has repeatedly objected to the candidateship of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president Gjorge Ivanov said that he intends to ignore the vote.
However, the referendum voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue that the change in name is just the price that the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin's watches remain silent because Harlem's churches are in trouble
“The oldest people I’ve talked to have said that one bar and one church were on each corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“They aren’t either.”
He said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People communicate differently today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living room of the neighbourhood, where people are staying every day.”
However, regarding the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets does not last as long as the leaders expect, and “before or later they will be back at the beginning.”
Adams added that churches can be replaced with apartment buildings full of people who do not provide help to the rest of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of those buying apartments in these buildings are white," he added, "that's why they accelerate the arrival of the day when all these churches close their doors because it's unlikely that most people living here will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white churches before Harlem became a black metropolitan community, built in 1870, the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The church of black people who had so far worshipped God in the vicinity took over the right of ownership of the building.
The church of St. Martin hosted the African American congregation with reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led the main buyer of Harlem’s 125th Street stores when they refused to hire or promote the blacks.
In the fire of 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when the members of the father Johnson congregation were planning the restoration of the building, they introduced a carilion or clock game.
Father Johnson’s son and the successor in St Martin’s Church, reverend David Johnson, called the clocks of poor people with pride.
However, the expert who played the july karilion gave it a second name: “cultural value” and “unreplaceable historical tool”.
The expert at Tiffany Ng Michigan University also noted that it was the world’s first carilion played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a bigger carilion 18 years ago in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
It has been a story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by the world leaders of the church, other bishops.
In July, the leader of the church, which consisted of world leaders, complained to the bishop in writing that the bishop “wired to pass on the costs”, although it was not even related to the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the Bishop.
Some members complain about the poor transparency of the Bishop's actions.
In California, the Hai injured a boy dived after the 13-year-old homars
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived in California on the opening day of the homarian season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinita.
Chad Hammel told the San Diego KSWB TV that he had been diveging with friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's help screams and then swim up to others to help the boy out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm about the arrival of a homarian, but “I knew the boy shouted “I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
The whole of his bracelet had been naked,” Hammel described the vision he saw when he reached the boy.
“I asked everyone to come out of the water: “There is shark in the water.”
The boy was taken to the Rady Child Hospital in San Diego.
Assaulted shark species are unknown so far.
Water rescuer and Captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that sharks had been seen a few weeks earlier in the area, but then it was established that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were located in the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinita for 48 hours from Casablad to Swamini for research and safety purposes.
Giles added that there are more than 135 shark species in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Gotsbury's plans to take power in the UK's beauty market
Getsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, creating supermarket-like beauty-like intermediaries, where experts also work.
As part of the major entry into the UK's 2.7 billion pounds of beauty market, which continues to increase in the sales of fashion and home goods, the wider ranges of beauty products across 11 stores across the country will be tested, taking them into account in other shops next year, if successful.
It is invested in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to make use of the shelf space previously allocated to television, microwave ovens and home goods.
Sainsbury's said that it plans to double its choice of beauty products up to 3000 products, including for the first time trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing product options from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are also given more space in brands as currently available in Boot stores.
Supermarket will also re-market its makeup series Boutique, where most products are suitable for vegans, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, the retailer of perfumes, experiments in two Sainsbury stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opened this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food from local food shops means that supermarkets need to try more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said that the sales sites are becoming increasingly similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain tries to fight cheap sales chains such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury has put Argos's sales places in hundreds of stores. The same is done with Habitat's sales sites, since Sainsbury's purchased both chains two years ago, which allegedly supported the sale of food products and made purchases more profitable.
Supermarket's earlier attempt to update its beauty and treatment departments ended with failure.
Sainsbury experimented with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but it ended with a cloth on how to share the revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold his 281 sons for a pharmaceutical business three years ago for £125 million to Celesio, which belongs to the whole Lloyds Pharmacy store.
In the strategy, Lloyds also plays its role, adding its four stores to the product range of luxury skin care products, including trademarks such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s business manager Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty products to improve the environment surrounding customers.
We have also spent money on specialized staff who are always ready to advise.
Our trademark choice meets every need. However, a fast-tracking environment and convenient locations mean that we are now competing with the destination of beauty trade, which can change the old way of purchasing."
Peter Jones is maruvihane because Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of transactions
The Dragons Den Star Peter Jones left the "harm" when the TV director Holly Willoughby gave up a 11 million pounds of deal in his lifestyle trademark business to focus on new agreements with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby is short of time for home goods and clothes for Truly.
A few business is compared with Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop.
The 37-year-old TV director of this Morning reported his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons Den star to deepen the wrath of Peter Jones by stepping out of their luxury lifestyle brand for the last minute to focus on its new successful agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources said Jones was “maruvihane” when the television stargirl acknowledged at a tense meeting that took place on Tuesday at the headquarter of the man’s business empire in Marlows Buckinghamshire that his new contracts at a value of 1,5 million pounds mean that the woman no longer has enough time to commit to Truly’s trademark for homewear and clothing.
The business has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop and was thought to double Willoughby’s estimated 11 million pounds of property.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left United Kingdom to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, “Truly was definitely Holly’s main preference.
It had to ensure his far-reaching future, so she thought she would be involved in the next few decades.
His decision to leave was a complete amazement.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to placing the product series on the market.
There are warehouses in Marlow's headquarters full of ready-to-sale goods."
Experts believe that the departure of one of the most paid celebrity in the United Kingdom, the head of the TV show, can pay millions, because the products whose choice ranges from sofa pillows and candles to clothes and homewear, are invested in a luxurious amount of money. It can also be accompanied by a later marketing of the product.
This may mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cappi for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Cappi in 2016. The 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as president in March.
Couples attend holiday trips and Jones has 40% participation in the Baldwin Teleproduction Company.
Willoughby becomes a M&S brander and replaces Ant McPartlin's ITV TV series "I'm A Celebrity".
One of Jones’s close sources said last night, “I don’t want to comment on his business.”
Hard talk, "after what we fell in love"
Trump was joking about criticism, which was directed in the news for a comment that some believed to be "presidents" and for over-positive positiveness with North Korea's Head of State.
Why has President Trump abandoned so much?
Trump said with the voice of the news anchor:
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim was after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards revoking nuclear weapons in North Korea, interested in the second meeting.
However, the negotiation of nuclear weapons has stopped.
More than three months after the summit held in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the “conforming” response to the original positions of the North Korea.
He stated that the United States will continue to undergo pressure.
Trump's excitement was much more fun.
“We’re doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“The war was beginning with North Korea.
Millions of people would be dead.
It's all right with us now."
He said that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have brought good results: there are completed missile attempts, helped to release hostages and arranged to bring American servants to the homeland.
He also protected his unusual communication with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be private, but instead of allowing 10,000 people to wait outside to get to this full-top stadium, it’s better to have nearly 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the population in front of them.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy the Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
When the consequences of the earthquake of Lombok were eliminated, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population had to be relocated, a national disaster was not declared a prerequisite for international assistance.
“They have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international assistance, so the stories are a little complicated,” Mrs. Sumbung said.
While the organization Save the Children sets up a team to go to Palus, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, President of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian authorities will evaluate the situation in Palus to decide whether international authorities will be allowed to contribute to assistance.
In view of how frequent earthquakes are in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly little prepared to engage in natural forces.
Although they are built in Aceh for a shelter tsunami, they are not particularly common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given for tsunami, the apparent lack of tsunami warning increased the number of deaths in the Palm.
Travelling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is also quite challenging at best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship stopping to treat the victims of the earthquake in Lombok is headed to Palus, but it takes at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo changed Indonesia's fragmented infrastructure to the central part of its electoral campaign and has distributed money on roads and railways.
However, budget deficits threaten Mr Joko's government, as the next year there are new elections.
In Indonesia, Mr Jokot also pressures the tensions of fellowships, where members of the Muslim community in the majority have turned towards the oldest form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes due to the struggles between the Christian and Muslim forces in the streets, where they used chess, vibes and arrows and other original weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge hits the link gate against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from the loss of Chelsea in Premier League, making the 89th game minute at Stamford Bridge, London, in a Saturday game.
Sturridge was eaten from Xherdan Shaqir, around 27 metres from Chelsea Gate when his team led 1 :0.
He hit the ball to the left before he hit it in the direction of a remote post.
The ball flew highly over the punishment area and hit the right corner of the network.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the network.
“I was just trying to get a position like this, get to the ball, and players like Shaq give the ball as much forward as possible, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, I made a touch, and I gave a longer blow without thinking.”
After the end of the first half, Chelsea 1 : 0 led the Belgian star Eden Hazard to the gate on the 25th game minute.
In this game, the Blues attacker went back to Mateo Kovacici, before he turned around on the middle field and sculpted to Liverpool.
Kovacic gave me a quick meal in the middle field.
Then he created a beautiful air feed, leading Hazard to the punishment.
Hazard got through the protection and hit the ball with the left leg from Liverpool's player Alisson Becker to the network on a remote post.
Liverpool plays with Napoli in the subgroup of the Masters League on Wednesday at 15.00 Stadio San Paolol in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Euroliiga game on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia increased to 832
In Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami’s deaths rose to 832, the state’s disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
A large number of people were trapped on Friday and 18 metres of giant waves brought together by 7.5 magnetic earthquake, the press conference of the agency said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu with over 380 000 inhabitants was buried under collapsed buildings.

The police call to contact the people who moved in the area who might have seen or heard something.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The study is just beginning, but I would ask everyone who was near John Street and heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers whose cameras could record something, to contact us because they may have vital information for our investigation.”
The police spokesman confirmed that a woman found in a building was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, a woman’s alleged friends came to the scene who asked questions about where she was found in the morning.
The investigation is underway, and the police said they're informing the woman's neighbors at the moment.
The taxi driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was abducted from the case.

The shape of Parliament’s Cromwell is the last memorial, which is the cause of “rewriting history” dispute.
The elimination of this would be a poetous justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style of the man's uninhuman guardians.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's recommendation as a foolish and attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: “In the debate on the eradication of the shapes, it was impossible to remain anonymous in the memory of Oliver Cromwell’s Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not rob the pictures of the English Civil War itself, nor commanded others to do so.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas's actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s excellent presentation is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of the person to whom many people still believe to be respected.”
Mr Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “A lot of people preferd at the end of the 19th and today Cromwell Parliament defends external pressure and, in this case, of course, the king’s power.
Whether it is a precise reflection, it is an infinite historical dispute.
It is certain that the mid-19th century dispute has shaped our people’s further development and Cromwell clearly represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as the Lord's Defense deserve to be celebrated and remembrance."
Killed Chinese Farmer
According to local media coverages, the farmer in Southeast China attacked a pig that killed a man on the market.
The man who was identified only by the family name Yuan was found dead with the injured artery and covered with blood from the liupanshu market in Guizhou Province on Sunday, reported the South China newspaper Morning Post.
On 30 May 2005, the seafarer manufactured in Xining, Qinghai Province, China to vaccinate pigs in its table.
It was alleged that he had come from the Neighbourhood Province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin of the man found him dead and discovered that the side of the neighborhood was open.
He said there was a big bloody slack in the sculpture.
The investigation of the case-experience confirmed that 249,47 kilograms of orange had been reported to kill the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and slapped,” said the cousin Wu of Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera records showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 04:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found almost an hour later.
The animal killed by the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The Market Manager told Evening News that the pig was locked in so that he could not attack anyone else until the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market leaders allegedly discuss payment of compensation for the death of a man.
Although rarely, it has also been observed that pigs attack people.
In 2016, the pig attacked the woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farm.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294,83 kilograms pounded on the Wales farmer tractor until the man’s wife frightened the animal away.
In 2012, when a farmer of Oregon had eaten his own pigs, one farmer of Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs were not usually attacked, but because of the blood's taste, they could go out of their heads.
“They’re just gambling.
They are very curious marathons whose goal is not to hurt.
They just have to be respected enough," said the man.
Orkaan Rosa's after winds bring extensive rainbows in the southwest of the United States
According to the predictions, orcan Rosa is weakening, moving across the southern coast of Mexico towards cooler waters.
However, in the coming days, Rosa brings rainfalls to North Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
On Sunday morning at 05:00 a.m. in the eastern coast, Rosa classified as the first category of wind blowing 136.78 km per hour, located 619.59 km southeast of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa moves northward on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure on the Pacific will develop, moving east to the West coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the tropical storm to the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will lead deep tropical humidity towards the southern United States.
On Monday, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains up to 25.4 centimeters.
The tropical humidity with an approaching low pressure will then create extensive rainlights in the southern part of the country in the near future.
It causes 2.54 to 10.16 centimeters of rainfall dangerous sudden fires, flood water and possible paintings in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes an increase in the amount of rain to five to about seven and a half centimeters per hour, especially in South Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to be between 5.08 and 10.16 centimeters of rainfalls in certain southern regions of the United States, especially in Arizona.
Suspensions are possible with rapid deteriorating conditions due to the dispersion of tropical rains.
It should not be possible to move on foot in the desert if there is a risk of tropical rainfall.
Strong rain can cause canons to become rapidly flowing rivers and lightning storms to occasionally explode wind rays and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure brings acute rainbows to the southern California coastal areas.
It is possible that the total amount of rainfalls extends more than 1,27 centimeters and can cause smaller flood water and slippery roads.
This would be the first saw in the region in the raintime.
The tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona on Sunday late evening and on Monday early morning, rainfalls become extensive on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Strong rainbows reach Four Corner on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday.
In October, the United States predicts high temperature fluctuations due to the cooling of the Arctic, while the temperatures remain high in tropical areas.
It sometimes leads to high temperature changes in small areas.
The Sunday weather is a great example of significant temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range to 20 degrees.
In the following days, he tries to rebuild himself in a long summer heat.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to be warm in the beginning of October with the temperatures of 80 warm radians round from the south to the northeast of the country.
In New York, on Tuesday, 26,6 warmth radiation is expected, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows the probability of high average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was reviewed by over 20 million people
On Thursday, over 20 million people watched the confessions of the candidate Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court on six TV channels and the woman who allegedly accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
At the same time, the political conspiracy continued, where broadcasters interrupted the demonstration of regular broadcasts to reflect the last minute of Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake made an agreement to the FBI to arrange a one-week prosecution.
Ford told the Senate to the Legal Committee that it is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed her drunk head and tried to drop her clothes at the high school's prom.
Kavanaugh said in his celebrity that it is absolutely certain that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen’s report, over 20,4 million people probably looked at the transfer on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately on other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has usually problems with the calculation of the number of people who look at transfers in the authorities.
For comparison, it can be said that it is about the same big audience as the final football tournament games or Oscars.
Fox News Channel's leaders, who strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the networks at an average of 5.69 million audiences throughout the day, said Nielsen.
ABC 3.26 million viewers stayed in the second place.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
The interest was also great after the trial.
Flake was the central character of the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office filed a statement that he voted for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras hit the man on Friday morning when he had fallen under the protesters' armour, trying to go to the judiciary meeting with an elevator.
He was standing on the ground for several minutes when he was accused and transferred directly to CNN.
"I'm standing right here," said a woman.
“Do you think he tells the truth to the state?”
He was told, “You have power, while as many women are fully enacted.”
Flake said that his department issued an application and added before the lift was closed that he had more to say at the meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Cable and broadcasting networks reflected the direct transmission several hours later when the Legal Committee had to vote in order to forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate.
But Flake said that he was doing this only in understanding that the FBI will investigate the charges against the candidates next week, which have been required by the minority democrats.
Flake partially convinced a conversation with a friend of Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision had an impact, as it was evident that the Republicans would not be able to summarize Kavanaugh's votes without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated a FBI investigation on Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit's critics on the political game
The Prime Minister accused the interview given to Sunday Times to those who judge his plans to leave the European Union, in the “political game” with the future of the United Kingdom and the damage of national interest.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May, with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pressured his attack on the Brexit Chapel, saying that the proposal for the UK and the EU to collect each other's tariffs is "very brain-free".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as suspected of murder of LSU player
The police arrested a man suspected of the 20-year-old LSU basketball player's death of Wayde Sims.
A 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison with a second-grade murder charge, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published a video of the resistance between Sims and Simpson. Police added that Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
The police found glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson DNA, informed the CBS TV channel WAFB.
After surveying Simpson, the police said the man confessed to shooting Wayde dead.
The lawyer announced that the man's bail was set at $35,000 (EUR 308 600.30).
East Baton Rouge’s coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday, according to which a bullet wound was killed in the neck of the head.
The department thanks the police of Louisiana State for the aid provided for the police operating group, the state police criminal laboratories, the Southern University police and the people living in the area, which led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the legal defence bodies in the region for the “settling of care and justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
1,98 meters old man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball in LSU.
His last season game average was 5.6 points and 2.6 tableballs.
In the morning of Friday, the LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the entire team was “fighted” and “shocked” due to the death of Wayde.
“This is something that you always worry about,” Wade said.
The volcano blows the ashes to Mexico City
Ash from the volcano called Popocatepetli has reached the southern cities of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the action started again in the crater, resulting in the registration of 183 cases of gas emissions and ash burning in 24 hours.
The center was stabbing a number of noises and shakes.
Photos shared in the social media were presented in different parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in volcano activity at 72 km south of the capital after 7.1 magnitude earthquake was shaken in the middle of Mexico in September 2017.
Don Goyo's volcano has been active since 1994.
The police have crashes with the Catholic Separatists before the anniversary of the independent vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the collusion of protesters with mourning police.
A group of masked fighters who kept back the moisture police, attacked the last eggs and powder colors, creating thick dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
The rustles also occurred later when the police had to use the sniffs to control the fights.
For many hours, “No dream, no forgiveness,” the singers of independence blew together with the consensus of the state, who called “Spain of life.”
According to the local press, 14 demonstrations of medical assistance received minor injuries.
The efforts will continue to be in the area of independence a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum to be illegal, but which was still celebrated by the Catalans in favour of separation.
The voters decided overwhelmingly to benefit from independence, although the electoral activity was low, because the voters against the withdrawal were largely ignored.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in front of the entire district's voting departments, which resulted in violent collisions.
Independence voters had stayed in front of the voting parties on Friday night in order to avoid demonstrations supporting national police.
However, the statements took place, but you had to take another way.
A 68-year-old Narcis Termes, who participated in the demonstration of separation with his wife, said that he had no hope of seeing the Catalanity independent.
“In the last year, one of the best moments of our life took place.
I saw my parents crying gladly to vote for the opportunity, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important, but small wins in the regional elections in December last year, the political parties supporting the independence of Catalan have been difficult to maintain this year as many of the most well-known leaders have either deported themselves or have been held up and awaited the judgement of their part in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who records a demonstration with his mobile phone to support the police, said that the dispute was brought by politicians on both sides.
“The situation becomes increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the pre-examination prison since the previous year, announced that he will participate in the election of the European Parliament next year.
“In the elections of the European Parliament, candidates are the best way to condemn the recession of democratic values and the pressures of the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: a man was arrested because his car was ramming the house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car in Londonderry repeatedly ramped the house.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 p.m. in British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was made to the gates and the building.
There was also a chance to let the car in the direction of the vibunol at some point.
Menga strike gives Livingston 1 to 0 wins in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first gate for Livingston
The promoted Livingston open Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to another loss in 18 games when the man was the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Menga attack was proven to be decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard stays in the first league of the season and stands against the leading Hearts on the next Sunday, eight points on the ground.
Before this, Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in Euroliiga.
In the meantime, Livingston expanded his unbeatable attack to seven games, while Chief Holt still felt the taste of loss since Kenny Miler was replaced in the last month.
Livingston loses the opportunity for the visitors
The Holt team should have led a long time before hitting the gate, as their immediate gamestyle caused any problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the protection, but his efforts raided in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to hit Craig Halkett over the gate.
The strangers allowed Rangers to play in front of themselves, knowing that they could cause problems to guests in certain places.
And this is also the way a defining gate was hit.
Rangers gave up the free beating and Livingstone a chance to play the game Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded in the center of the punishment.
By that time, Rangers mainly held the ball, but could not penetrate the protection, so the gatekeeper Liam Kelly was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to protect the gate.
The Rangers Gate Guard Allan McGregor rejected Scott Pittman's strike and Lithgow shined brightly in Livingston's second teamwork.
The strikes continued to reach the Livingston Penalty Area and were swept away from it consistently. Also, two penal attacks were directed, one of them for attempting to replace Halketti Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with the hand.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaron Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was great, crossing the ladder by moving upwards with full expectations.
Their gamestyle and players have hardly changed since their return to the top level, but Holt needs to be respected for how he has punished the team since the arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, organizing excellently organized protection, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the back legs throughout the game.
But the Rangers had a little bit of inspiration.
Notwithstanding their intermediate well-being under Gerrardi's leadership, this was limited according to the examples here.
Their last possession of the ball was incomplete: the entry to the home took place only once, which could act as a alarm clock for the Rangers located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan contradictory reception in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), Berlin had both smiles and concerns when Turkish and German leaders met in breakfast.
This is the last day of the controversial German visit by President Erdogan, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They are excluded from issues relating to human rights, freedom of press and accession of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police referred to security, banning the collection of 25,000 members in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters appeared close to it to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan, a large part of which are deaf, also made his voice heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to host Turkish President in his country.
Fighting protests show that the attitude of the guest is fragmented: some Turks living in Germany welcome him as a hero, but others despise a man as a self-governant.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: the bicycle was killed by a car crash
In London, a bicycle invaded against the car died.
The collision took place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street crossroads in Deptford, in the southeast of the city at 10:15 a.m., according to the British summer time.
The driver stopped and the help arrived to provide medical care, but the man died at the scene.
A collision occurred a few months after another bicycle died in a collision about two kilometres from the Saturday accident at the Childers Street, where the driver who hit the bike escaped the scene.
The London Police said the authorities are involved in identifying a man and informing his loved ones.
In the event, traffic is closed and buses are redirected, motor vehicles are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six prison officers were injured in trouble
The prison office reported that six prison officers were injured in the troubles that occurred in a very secure man prison.
The Peace broke out in His Majesty Long Lartin prison at Worcestershire on Sunday at 09:30 a.m. of the British summer season and has not yet ended.
A single wing with eight prisoners involved in aggravated resentment has been involved by experts from the marsh police officers.
Prison officers were treated with lighter face injuries at the scene.
The press spokesman of the prison service said: “The prisoner workers with special training have been invited to resolve the current case in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Five crew members received medical assistance due to injuries.
We cannot tolerate any violence in our prisons, the responsible are transferred to the police, and their prison punishment may be extended."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison manager was sent to hospital after the prisoner attacked him.
In October of the last year, however, a wet police officer was invited to prison to silence serious restlessness, during which prison officers were attacked with billions of bullets.
Orkaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden fires (can be useful for the ground areas)
The tropical low pressure does not often hit Arizona, but it is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, when a rainy hurricane Rosa moves across the southern desert of the United States, bringing a threat to the emergencies.
The National Weather Service has already organised a sudden monitoring of fires on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, in the southern and eastern part of Nevada, in the southern part of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaffi, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to prediction, Rosa heads straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area on Monday with rainfalls.
Phoenix’s national weather service shines that “from 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have preserved a tropical storm or low pressure levels at 321,86 kilometres radius from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64.37 kilometres from the border of Arizona.”
The latest models of the National Orchan Center predict from 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters of rainfalls, which can extend to 15.24 centimeters of Arizonas Mogollon Rim in limited areas.
In other parts of the United States of America’s front deserts, including the central part of the Kaljumäest and the Great Witch, the number of precipitations is likely to be 2.54 to 5.08 centimeters, reaching a limited area up to 10.16 centimeters.
Rosa’s rainfalls may be a blessing for the acute tolerance areas, because the region is depressed by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, such rainfalls are likely to be useful because of the drought in South America.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, or another category of drought, announced weather.com.
First of all, Rosa Baja California has crossed the island of Mexico.
Rosa, which was still on Sunday morning with the largest windlines at the orcan level, is currently 619.95 kilometres south of Punta Eugenian in Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 kilometres per hour to the north.
The storm is exposed to the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean, and therefore a little slow.
Rosa is therefore expected to arrive at the Mexican land with the strength of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The number of rainfalls in some Mexican regions can be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
“Baja from California to the northwest part of Sonora can be expected to rain between 7.62 and 15.24 centimeters, reaching up to 25.4 centimeters,” Weather.com announced.
Then, Rosa moves to the north of the tropical storm of Mexico, reaching the border of Arizona on Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure that moves across Arizona and reaches south of Utah on Tuesday late evening.
“The only threat that follows Rosa or its follow-up is a very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the southwest desert of the United States,” the National Orchan Center said.
These rainforests can cause life-threatening sudden arrivals and flood water in the deserts and paintings in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton's attack: four arrests related to the attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested with suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy found in Somerset.
The Teen Boy was found injured in Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00 a.m.
The victim was taken to the hospital in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested at night in Radstock in Avon and Somerset, said the police.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have mobile phone records from the case.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “sustained” the Democrat Party under “anger and wickedness”
"The support of President Kavanaugh is a voice against unrestricted and unacceptable tactics," Trump said in his excitement speech in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “received” during his appointment at the time of the Democratic Party under “justness and anger.”
Kavanaugh filed witnesses before Congress on Thursday, pushing abruptly and emotionally back the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford, according to which the man attacked him several decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the meeting, Ford also witnessed his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said, “America saw Kavanaugh’s glory, quality and courage that day.”
The voice given to the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to appoint one of the most valuable lawyers of our time with an impeccable background in public service," he said to the supportive population of West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of the election of the Republic in the interim elections.
Five weeks have remained the most important election of one of our lifetimes.
I'm not going to apply, but I'm actually applying for it," he said.
“I am everywhere to fight for excellent candidates.”
Trump argued that democrats had a mission aimed at “resistant and hindering”.
The first main procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's application is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, said CNN of the Republican Party leaders.
The earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of deaths is rising
At least 384 people died and many were washed when the giant waves invaded the beach after the strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday to the beach festival in Palu, when during the building, six-metre waves hit the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything left on the road.
Tsunami followed 7.5 magnitudes of earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people still did their activities on the beach, and they did not escape immediately, staying victims in this way,” said BNPB press conference at the press conference held at Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Jakarta.
“Tsunami didn’t come alone, but took cars, logs and houses with him, wiped everything from the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving on the open sea at a speed of 800 km per hour before reaching the shore.
Some people climbed from the tsunami to escape from the trees and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 center of Palu.
The air photographs published by the Catastrophic Board showed a number of destroyed buildings and stores, broken and collapsed bridges and mosses surrounded by water.
The findings in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
In the area of 2.4 million inhabitants, the wave of earthquakes was known.
In his statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said that after a strong earthquake on Friday, the release of energy was nearly 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city located near the long and narrow Bay could increase the strength of the tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as "proximity" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said that some of the bodies of the victim were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number and damages of the dead could be greater than the 300 km north of Palos in the coastal area called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake.
Announcements from Donggala “are completely incomplete and contain no information,” Nugroho said.
“There are over 300 000 inhabitants in the area,” Red Cross said in his statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading to the affected places.
“It’s already a tragedy that can get worse,” he said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing the tsunami in the city of Palu, although the authorities said that the waves arrived at the beach while the warning was issued.
Amateur amateurs in social media see a man on the upper floor of a building who warns against the tsunami approaching people on the street below.
A few minutes later, the water supply arrives at the beach, carrying houses and cars.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the accuracy of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a major electrical interruption that hindered communication in the Palu region and made it difficult to organise the rescue of the authorities.
The Army has started sending transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities to help, said the authorities, but evacuators still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue work, remaining closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centres on Sunday.
Due to the Indonesian tsunami, the number of deaths increased over 800.
It's very bad.
Although the World Vision staff from Donggala saferly reached the city of Palu, where they were hidden in the scenes set up in their office’s yard, they saw the impressive views of their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They said they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
While the aid forces strongly began to mitigate the catastrophe, some complained that workers from foreign aid organisations were prevented from traveling to Palus.
In accordance with Indonesia’s rules, funds, stocks and support forces may only be sent from abroad if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the province,” said Aulia Arrian, a press representative of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
“When the government says, “Okay, it’s a national disaster,” we can begin to receive international assistance, but such a situation has not yet been declared.”
When the second night came to hand after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends of lost people and families were still full of hope that they were close to these wonderful cases that ease the birth of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted out of the sanitation.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was trapped two days next to his mother’s body.
Indonesian national slider guard team coach Gendon Subandono trained two lost slider guards for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of those who are trapped in the Roa Roa hotel are his students, added to Mr. Mandagi.
“I have a personal burden as a slider guard from the seenior,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how after the Roa Roa hotel collapsed, he was desperately sent messages to the Palu competitors who were at the beach festival.
His messages were only marked with one gray bird instead of two blue birds.
“I think that means that the messages didn’t reach,” he said.
Vargad took 23 585.88 euros in the Newport on the Levees
In the morning of Friday, the thieves stole theft from the British employee who executed the Levees banking machine, 23 585,88 euros, published in the Newport Police Department press release.
The driver emptyed a bank machine in the entertainment facility and manufactured more money, and Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
When the man acted, “the other man runs behind the back of the Brink employee” and stole the bag for delivery, which was full of money.
The witnesses saw a number of suspects fleeing from the scene, writes a press release, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have information about early persons are asked to contact the Newport Police on the phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper takes his new name Ye
Rabbit Kanye West turns his name to Ye.
On Saturday, the man said, “The former Kanye West.”
From the age of 41, Westi has been called by the nickname Ye for a while and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change occurs before his presentation on Saturday Night Live, where a man is expected to publish his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grandet, who revoked his concert “the anger of emotions”, said the author.
In addition to the fact that it is a shortening of the man’s current name, West has previously said that it is a religiously important word for him.
"I think "ye" is one of the most used word in the Bible, which means "you" there," West said earlier, discussing the name of the album with the radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“This is you, it’s us, it’s us.
I changed my name from Kanye, which means "this one", the name Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and evil, our confusion, and everything else.
The album is a more reflection of who we are.”
Kanye West is not the only rapper who plays his name.
Sean Combs is primarily known under the names of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that the names of Love and Brother Love were preferred.
Formerly co-operated with West, JAY-Z has also used its name with a clash of thought and without it, with large and small letters.
Mexican politician AMLO promised not to use military forces against civilians
At the time when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the attacks of blood against students, Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he would never use military forces against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza that “he would never use military forces to control mexicans.”
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration on the field on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when the entire Latin America had to carry the left-wing student movements.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young mexicans, paying students monthly grants and opening more free national universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draws young criminals to the gangs.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence.
“When China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount to be allocated to research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after the various parts of the US government made statements concerning artificial intelligence, although the US does not have an official industrial intelligence strategy.
At the same time, China introduced its plan to be a factor in the upgrading of artificial intelligence by 2030 last year.
“The double-intelligible research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so much behind the US and that we are working for the next artificial intelligence breakthrough,” Lee said.
The double funding would double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence achievement would be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked with an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best Othello player in America. Later, he was a man in Microsoft Research and the head of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee recognized the previous US government technology competitions such as the U.S. Department of Defence Research Projects Robotics Challenge (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge) and asked when the next competition will take place to help identify the next dreamers.
“US researchers have to work hard to get funding from the government,” Lee said.
“China is not the one who takes over the branches, they are businesses,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired high-quality scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to support artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think people who have received a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card,” the man said.
The Chinese National Council published the next generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Sciences Foundation distributes funding to people working in academic institutions similarly to how the National Research Fund and other Government Institutions allocated money to US scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a connected industrial intelligence centre aimed at involving partners from both industry and educational institutions, but the White House announced the establishment of a selected committee of artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that AI Next started funding a $2 million initiative.
However, the National Research Fund finances over $100 million per year in research related to artificial intelligence.
At the same time, there was no amendment to the US legislation aimed at establishing a national security committee for artificial intelligence.
Macedonians vote on changing their national name in the referendum
The Macedonians voted on Sunday’s referendum on whether the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia would be a step that would also resolve a decades of dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia’s EU and NATO membership from confirming the statements.
Greece, where the province is named Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour’s name constitutes a requirement for this territory and has banned Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on the new name of Macedonia, but the opponents of the nationals claim that the name would damage the national personality of the Slavian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he did not intend to participate in the referendum and the irregularity campaign has raised doubts about whether the election activity will achieve the 50% participation rate necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The referendum asks: “Do you support the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price worth paying Macedonia, one after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure accession to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, a 79-year-old voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The two-thirds majority of Parliament are necessary for a change in the name.
The National Election Committee said there were no reports of irregularities at 3:00 p.m.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent voted for registered voters.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital of Macedonia in Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son Dushko, voted in favour of the Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, in front of the Parliament building in Skopje, prepared a small stage, raising the tents in front of those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the door of the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and get from the integration of Europe-Aasia.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would take the necessary investments in Macedonia with more than 20% unemployment rates.
“I believe that a large majority supports the change of the name because more than 80% of citizens support EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said.
He said "yes-word" would be "reasonable for our future".
The results of the survey published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute on Monday revealed that 30-43% of the voter will participate in the referendum, which is below the required electoral activity.
The survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would answer "yes".
The success of the referendum is 50% plus one vote.
The failure to vote for a referendum would constitute the first serious blow to the Western policy of the government after the government took over the government in May of the past year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through all Brighton protection for the goal of the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling invaded Brighton's defense by guaranteeing the Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester in England.
Aguero made it look like the gate hit on his 65th game minute came ridiculously easily.
The Argentine attacker passed the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He penetrated three Brighton defenders before reaching the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He invaded another defender before he ran through several players in the Brighton Penalty Area.
Then he hit the ball to the left where Sterling was.
The English attacker used the first shot to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to hit the Brighton gate guard with Mathew Ryan on the right side of the network.
“Aguerol has problems with legs,” said Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola reporters.
“We said he was playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he created the gate at that moment.”
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial success in Premier League.
The gate was hit at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in Brighton's territory.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane could hit the ball a few times before driving Sterling.
Sky Blues hit the ball on the net right before it slipped out of the borders.
Manchester City plays in the subgroup of the Masters League with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheimis, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a happily fighter against Rockiese
When the Nationals left out of the final tournament games, there was no great reason for the new beginning.
Scherzer, however, hopes to land Colorado Rockiese on Sunday, but only if Rockiesel, who runs NL West with one game to Los Angeles Dodgers, still hopes to get to the final.
Rockies guaranteed at least 5 to 2 wins over the Nationals Friday night, but the team still wants to ensure the status of its first division.
“We don’t play for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in this audience and another team in Denver is probably higher than any other game ahead of me this year.
Why don't I want to compete here?”
The nationals have not yet called a Sunday opening player, but they are allegedly in such a situation towards Scherzer’s dinner.
Scherzer, for whom it would be 34th feeding, made a warming and feeding on Thursday normally on Sunday.
This right-handed player in Washington runs between 18 and 7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of outlocks 300 and the advantages of its 220 2/3 in this season.
Trump has an excitement call in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to a situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of the election of the Republic in the election elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime is one of the most important elections.
This is a great event that I do not apply, but I actually apply, so I am everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extreme group of democrats, and you see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back power using any means. You can see their beast and dirty game.
They don’t care who they’re hurting, who they have to drive over for power and control. The only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we don’t give them it.”
Democrats are on his claim to be a mission aimed at “resistant and hinder”.
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “anguish, wicked, naked, and false.”
He referred to a democratic member of the Senate Legal Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was screamed loudly among the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, huh, what?
No, uh, no, wait, it was one of the worst examples of body language, actually the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Leiborist Party is no longer a great connection.
It is unbearable for those who express their opinions
When my local party activists voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last of the campers on the list of Members of Parliament to whom you are not welcome, and this is all for the publication of your opinion.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, became part of the same treatment because he strongly stood for Jewish opposition.
In my case, the judges judged me for not consulting Jeremy Corbyn.
In matters of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are strangely similar to those of which Jeremy had disagreement with previous leaders.
Nottingham East’s Communist Party said “We want meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
For the most part, the experience of my eight-year local camper with the meetings of the General Assembly of Friday evenings is exactly the same.
As far as today’s day is concerned, it does not apply to most meetings, and the promise to be “smart and generous” in politics has long been forgotten when it was never remembered.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the different perspectives are not acceptable in the Leiborist Party, and for each opinion, it is assessed that the party is acceptable to the board.
This began immediately after Jeremy became a leader. A co-worker with whom I thought I had previously shared political views was now waiting for me to change my mind and to accept the positions I would never otherwise have agreed, whether it was a matter of national security or the single market in the EU.
Whenever I step up publicly, regardless of what I'm actually saying, it follows the condemnation of social media, inspireing my call, ignoreing the party's policy and saying that I shouldn't be part of the Leiborist Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more lucky than some of my co-workers, because my comments are mostly political.
I admire the competence and decision-making capacity of the co-workers who face sexual or racial abuse every day, but never swear.
One of the most disappointing positions in this policy area is how abuse levels have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Leiborist Party should promote tolerance culture.
The reality is, however, that we are no longer such a great association and that every "confidence" initiative or election rules become more narrow than the party.
In the last two years, I have been given a lot of advice to keep my head down, to talk less, and “then it would be all right.”
But I didn't come to politics.
From the moment I joined the Leiborist Party 32 years ago, motivating the neglect of the Government of Thatcher, which had literally left my high school classroom at the end of the collapse, I have tried to speak for better public services to those who most need it, acting as a minister of both the local council and the government.
I have never hidden my policy, including in the last elections.
In any case, no one in Nottingham in East was confused with my political positions or local leadership in the areas of non-consulting.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that when the country moves to Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
But in fact, it is not the only message I have, for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my advocates, whether they belong to the Leiborist Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one of the threats or political considerations of the call for return do not stop me from acting for what I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have been somewhat overturned, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves a win in this wonderfully fun game of Tennet’s first too.
They are now the only unsuccessful team in the top of the table.
After all, this team was a high level of protection and better risk-taking, which led the home team and coach Peter Murchiel has a full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tried all the time during the games, and we’re still invincible, so of course I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie Melrose said, “I love Ayrist, they used their options better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14th game minute attempt, which was taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayri the success, but the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who gave Warriors the game, gave Melros the opportunity to perform the failed attempt by Jason Baggot.
Climo increased Ayri's success with a penal strike just before the end of the half-term, reaching a position at the end of the semester for the benefit of 17-5 Ayri.
But Melrose successfully started the second half of the year, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which took over Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knotti, after which the man was taken away at the cander station. In the course of the game, Ayr’s successes were further increased due to the test passed by Climo by Stafford McDowall.
Ayri CEO Blair Macpherson was then with a yellow card, but he paid again by Melrose player Bruce Colvine's attempt to fail to transmit after strong pressure.
However, the team playing in the home field gathered strength again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for preventing Climo without the ball, MacPherson put the ball behind the advanced Ayries.
Climo gave the ball forward, as he did almost immediately after the game continued, when Kyle Rowe tried David Armstrong's box and sent side protection Gregor Henry to go on the fifth test of the team playing on the home field.
Still Game Star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to enter the hosting area, after finding that a man was appointed as director of a recognized restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actress plays in a BBC TV series known from Jack Jarvi, where he plays with long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
A couple have announced that the 9th season will be the last of the series and it seems that Kiernan will live after the new plans of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment, but Scottish Suni’s source suggested that Kiernan would like to enter Glasgow’s “great restaurant business”.
“Meri is ours,” Bolivia, without sea border, hopes that the court will open the road to them again to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patroling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
The ocean blue flags flew over the buildings of the office.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, there is a leading sentence: “Meri is our right.
Recovery is our duty."
In Bolivia without sea borders, the memory of the coastal line lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive. The same is the desire to reboot in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are sometimes the highest in the last decades, because Bolivia is waiting for a decision to be taken by the International Court after five years of negotiations on 1 October.
“Bolivia has a temper, a spirit of unity and peace, and the country is naturally waiting for a shared outcome,” said Bolivia diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Hulk Bolivians across the country will look at the decision of the international court on large screens, hoping that the Hague court will decide for Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia for the last independent sea.
The Bolivia charismatic presidency president, Evo Moralesel, who is facing a controversial battle in the next year, is considering a lot in the Monday decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts think that the court will probably not vote for Bolivia, or if it would change very little.
The United Nations authorities in the Netherlands do not have the power to surrender the Chile territory and it has provided that it does not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that only six months after hearing the final statements refers to the fact that it was not a “complicated case”, said Chile International Law Expert Paz Zárate.
And in the absence of additional reasons for Bolivia, the last four years could have deteriorated the situation.
“The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by the current Bolivia authorities,” Zárate said.
Moralese's warrior beauty speech has lost all the remaining Chile's goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all, the debate is extremely difficult.
Two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the court was inadmissible.
Monday gives Bolivia the opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile, and the opportunity to “find 139 years of disputes with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America, would use the issue of the sea to express political frustration.
“Bolivia never abandons its right to access the Pacific,” she added.
“It’s a chance to see that we need to get over the past.”
North Korea said that nuclear weapons will not be released until the United States can't trust
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people will never give up nuclear weapons as the first to trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Meeting.
He called on the United States to review the promises given to each other during the Singapore summit by the leaders of competitors.
He commented on the matter when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo almost appears to be re-starting nuclear diplomacy in blockade for more than three months after the meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Uni.
According to Ri, it is air-resistant that the US continues to restrict and refuse to terminate war with Korea.
Washington will be careful about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards arming.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, skepticism is widespread, according to which Pyongyang intends to seriously give up the weapons that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyank next month to agree on another Kim and Trump summit.
Paris's mosquitoes bring to the viewer a series of massive head coverings that are brought to buyers in their neighbourhood buyers
If you want to increase your hat collation or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t have to look for it anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of strange head coverings in their 2019 summer season, which blinded Paris's fashion week.
High and unpractical hats are in the fashion of Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their striking creations to fashion.
Valentino’s excellence was the top of the models’ heads covered by the overpacked beech hat, which was decorated with a remarkable wide edge.
Other super-sized clothing included jewelry-built arboys, wizard hat and even ananass, but their goal is not to heat.
Thom Browne also showed a strange choice of masks, doing it at the right time before Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks were folded mouths, so they reminded Hannibal Lecter more than high.
One part of the creation reminded me of the diving costume with air tubes and glasses, while the other remembered the melted ice cream.
And if you continue with giant mournings, you're lucky.
Moegurs predict that super-sized headgears can also reach shopping bars near you.
High-sized hats come immediately to La Bomba, a 60 cm wide shoulder hat, seen in the head of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand created by a largely unpractical hat in the social media sent another large work to the fashionable – a bracket of shoulders, which is almost as large as a bikini model.
The dark orange raffle bag with raffy narmads and white leather, was the top of the summer collection of Jacquemuse La Riviera 2019 in Paris's fashion week.
Luke Armitage, a celebrity stiff said to FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags in the next summer. Since the designer has had so much effect, it would be difficult to ignore demand for superb clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are important to the citizens of the world
The Scottish private schools have remained at the top of the academic excellence table and continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and joint success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
The schools in which more than 30,000 students study all over Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS) are trying to provide their students and their parents the best service.
Private schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As a education sector, which can design and implement a curriculum adapted to the circumstances, we see that modern languages are still well-known and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “When you talk to a person in a language that he understands, it will come to his head.
When you talk to him in his mother tongue, it gets into his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The recent results of this year’s exams show that at the top of the tables, the levels of exams are the highest among private schools.
Overall, 68 percent of students who studied foreign language became a high result of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students became a price in mandarin A, the same rates were 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students.
This shows that Scottish private schools support the skills that children and young people need in the future as a foreign language for life.
Languages that are now among the choices of academics are the same in private schools and other schools as STEM curriculums (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
The study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, among the reasons why employers are difficult to find workers for free jobs, 17% of respondents had the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future work.
While more hopeable job offers require language skills, such skills in the global world are becoming essential.
Notwithstanding the career choice made, the acquisition of another language will give a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens will immediately give a competitive advantage to a multilingual person.
According to YouGov’s survey conducted in 2013 by more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of respondents do not speak any foreign language enough to have this conversation. The only language with two-digit knowledge was 15% in French.
Therefore, funding for language learning is important for children today.
Knowledge of many languages, especially in developing countries, will give children better opportunities to find good work.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
A large school focuses on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK in 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interest of the child, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and supplies them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future brings to them.
No longer can be denied that in the global business environment, languages are crucial for the future of the country, which must reflect in education as well.
Now, modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Private schools continue to offer young Scotland choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien is faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers Debüüd on Sunday in San Diego
Incredible respecters don’t have to wait to see LeBron James doing his debut in Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James was playing in a Sunday opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of the games still needs to be fixed.
“It’s more than one and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell shines that James is likely to play the number of minutes.
After last week's training, James was asked about his plans regarding the six-played pre-storm schedule in Lakers.
“I don’t need my career at the current stage of pre-season games to warm myself up,” he said.
Trump Western Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts his election campaign event series tonight in Wheelingus in West Virginia.
This is a campaign event scheduled for the next week by Trump from five, including stations in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
At the same time, while the vote for confirmation stands until Trump chooses to be appointed to the Supreme Court's free position, he will seek to increase support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened to lose control after the vote in November.
What time is Trump's campaign event in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
The Trump campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia, takes place on Saturday 29 September 2018 at 19:00 in the Eastern Coast.
The Trump Western Virginia campaign event can be viewed online via YouTube streaming.
Trump probably speaks of the candidate Brett Kavanaugh's sessions this week, which became tense about sexual misconduct charges. At the same time the Senat's confirmation vote has been suspended for a week until the FBI investigates the matter.
However, the main objective of the campaign event series is to help the Republicans gather a new boost to face difficult elections in November.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign leader said that the purpose of these five events next week is to “support volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the events belonging to them in Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“The control of the congress is so important for the president’s agenda that Trump will drive to the fastest season of election campaigns to dive into as many states as possible,” Reuters said Trump’s campaign press representative who did not want to mention his name.
Today’s campaign event, designed to take place at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, can bring supporters from “Ohiost and Pennsylvania and receive a reflection in the media of Pittsburgh,” said West Virginia Metro News.
It is a second time on Saturday when Trump visits West Virginia in the last month. It is a state where the man received more than 40 percent of the votes of voters in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is in charge of surveys.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has come to encourage his results,” said Reuters, politician Simon Haeder of the University of Western Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team gets nervous for the competition, keeping hopes high in front of Sunday single games
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon games were sometimes just what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating rotation point pencil is a completely fictional concept in sport, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this here.
So, where do they think the turning point would be now?
“They led by six points, which have now become four, so I think I can consider it a small turnpoint,” Jordan Spieth said.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear because it is driven by four points and there are 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that they don’t have enough wind in the sailings, but they have much encouragement, especially in Spiethi and Justin Thomas’ faces, who played together all day and both got three points out of four.
Spieth has been striking for both the tire and the grain and shows an example.
The winnings from the throat became more and more loud with each circle, shading a definite bug that would have led to the fourth match of the vigilance after he and Thomas were in the ground with two.
His pigeon, which defeated the match on 15, sent a similar celebration that showed a man’s belief that the Americans aren’t out of the race yet.
“You just have to play more focus and worry about your match,” Spieth said.
This is the only thing players can do.
18 holes to leave a trace.
Only players who have more points than Spieth and Thomas after the last two days have Ryder Cupi on undisputed stars Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood
Europe’s strange, but loved couple is four of four, and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit Bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday morning.
This game and the way their energy flows into such a noisy crowd, when back there, strengthens the opinion that players with whom they are competing on Sunday, and that if the sun looses over Le Golf National, there is no possible European winner as Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both at the same time in different holes.
However, the story of the glory of Europe is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero in the morning, a quick job when they put a couple with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles in the first nine were digging Spanish and Swedish into such a deep hole that they had no hope of digging out of it.
On Saturday, there is no one to help you out in August.
Four balls and couple games are extremely close to looking at communications between couples, advice to each other, unauthorized advice and the way five can change in the moment.
Europe has been playing as a team so far better and has become a strong leader for the last day, but this four session showed that the U.S. team has divided the nerve in which some, especially Americans have doubted.
Europe is located in Ryder Cupi on the last day 10-6
Europe will be able to make a great success in Ryder Cup’s last day, starting to lead 10-6 to the United States after Saturday’s four-balls and couple games.
The great duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the two winning Tiger Woods to raise their score in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European party, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of the cup lost in Hazeltine, ruled after the failure of the American side in the morning in four-months, winning the series 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in a couple game by winning two games, but they could not replace the shortcomings.
Jim Furyk's half needs eight points from Sunday 12 single games to store the cup.
Fleetwood is the first starter in Europe, who won four points in a row. With Molinar, who, after this talk weekend, is called Mollwood, they are the second couple who has won four points in Ryder Cup's history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeauve in a more secure way: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed an accidental shine, but now he lost his 29 four-balls and pairs of 19, having seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had relaxed four-balls in the morning, returning with partner Henrik Stenson, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is at the first and third place in the world order.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held with a pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
The three-fold great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points on Saturday to the Americans.
They gained a strong victory of 2-1 Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and winning a pair of Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 after losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team has come back from a four-point deficit, going to a single game, although as owners, Furyk's half needs only a link to maintain the carica.
Although two days at the second place, after a Sunday counterattack, it seems that they will not succeed.
North Korea says that “nothing” does not make them armed unilaterally because of lack of trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that the continuation of constraints deepened their infidelity against the United States and that the country would not, under such conditions, unanimously abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual meeting of the World Organization that North Korea has taken “markable good-taking measures” over the last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile techniques, dismantling the nuclear test site and making a promise not to disseminate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see that the US would have answered it,” he said.
“Of course, the US is untrusted, our country lacks security and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to unarm ourselves as the first one.”
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to a "structured" approach to the non-nuclearisation of North Korea, on the basis of which it was rewarded when he stepped up, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject unilateral weapons as Pjongjang has done in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump's joint statement on 12 June at the first summit held between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore, when Kim promised to move towards "refrain from nuclear weapons of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has wanted the official end of the Korean war between 1950 and 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to relax the strict international constraints for North Korea.
"The U.S. demands "for the first time to give up nuclear weapons" and increases the pressure on limitation to achieve their goal by force, even opposing the declaration of war ending," Ri said.
“It is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continuation of constraints will deepen our infidelity."
Ri did not mention the plans for Kim and Trump’s second summit, which the United Nations leader stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the meeting between three Kim and South Korea leaders Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: “If the nuclear weapons were one of the parties to South Korea, not the United States, the subject of nuclear weapons of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a doom.”
However, Ri’s speech differed sharply from the last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that turning North Korea’s missiles to the US continent was inevitable after the “Mr. Paha President” Trump called Kim’s suicide mission “armetist”.
This year, North Korea fully praised the threatened Trump, in the United Nations, to take steps for his courage to become armed, but added that there is still a lot to do and that the restrictions must remain valid until the nuclear weapons of North Korea have been abandoned.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no schedule for this, saying, “Is it going to take two years, three years or five months?”
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward the measures taken by Pjongjang.
At the same time, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the Soviet boundaries must continue in force and without fail until we can fully and ultimately confirm the release of nuclear weapons.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea by attempting to prevent the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Riga next to the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyank again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip didn’t go very well.
After the meeting with July Pyongyang, he said that progress has been made, after which North Korea condemned only within a few hours of “gangsterlike demands”.
North Korea promised to destroy rockets and nuclear complexs at the meeting with Moon this month if the United States were to implement “conform measures”.
He said that Kim had told him that under "conforming measures", that meant security guarantees allowed in Trumpi Singapore and moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to rest enough
This year, the Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to fight a growing aggressive culture, where they are learning through night-long learning marathons in caffeine-rich.
Students who love the academy of the world’s best university are often helpless when it comes to the basic truths of taking care of themselves.
The designer of this course, Harvard Medical School of Sleep and Brigham and Women’s Hospital Professional Professor Charles Czeisler, believes that this is the first character in the United States.
He encouraged the creation of a course after he spoke about how sleep problems affect learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, “Why are they telling me about it just now, in my last year of school?”
He said no one had ever told him the importance of sleep - it made me a patch," he explained to Telegraph.
The course, which came to a curriculum for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports results and also help improve their overall well-being.
The psychiatric professor of the Harvard Medical School and head of health care at the University, Paul Barreira, said that the university decided to take a curriculum after it was found that students were in a serious sleeping state of work week.
An hourly course includes a number of mutual tasks.
In one part, a picture of the common habitat is presented. Students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports footwear and books, and they will be explained by the effects of caffeine and light on how sleep deficiency affects the importance of athletic outcomes and the formed practice of sleeping.
The second part explains how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the University City with contradictory symbols encourages participants to think about their everyday-developed practice.
“We know this does not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health impact of smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
He said that night learning marathons are still proud, adding that modern techniques and increasing pressure for students mean that sleeplessness is a growing problem.
"The guarantee of a high-quality sleeping period should be a secret weapon of the student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety," he added. "It will even help against weight gain, because the lack of sleep makes the brain hungry, making a person hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemical and physical biology from California, helped professor Czeisler to create a course after attending one of his classes in the first year of Harvard.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to help create a university-wide course.
As a next step, he wants all graduate students to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to set a awakening clock for both sleeping and awakening, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” caused by electronic screens and LED light because it could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Menga Gate defeated Gerrardi men
The Rangers suffered from another poor guest game result when the Dolly Menga hit by Steven Gerrard brought a 1-0 win to Livingston.
Ibrox hoped to get his first guest victory since February, when 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt’s team only caused Gerrard’s second loss as a leader in the 18th game, leaving Ladbrokes Premiership in eight points away from Hearts.
Menga created its gate seven minutes before the half-time, and the poor preparedness of Rangers could not recover from it.
So, Rangers falls to the sixth position, Livingston rises to the third position, staying down to Hibernian with only one gate.
Rangers may not have ended, because their attacker, Calum Spence, needed a head wound after he was hit with an apparently discarded object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side that led to Ayrist and Betfred Cup's semi-final.
At the same time, Holt went on with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-trained boys chewed their opponents at every step.
Rangers might have been more dominant, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate on another opening minute when the first exchange of Menga sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregon, but the half guard did not take advantage of his opportunity.
The deep Keaghan Jacobs firefight was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but its defence partner Alan Lithgow was able to make only a wide-ranging post in the back.
The Rangers achieved control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos firmly felt that he would have to have a penal attack when he crashed with Steven Lawless on the 15th game minute, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy the complaint of the Columbia player.
Rangers managed to make only two shots to the target in the first half, but former Ibrox Gate Guard Liam Kelly was not concerned about Lassana Coulibaly's headphone or Ovie Ejaria's event.
Although Livi’s 34-minute openings may have violated the game rules, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performance.
Again, Rangers couldn’t control Jacobs’ deep hard play.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher hit a ball for Scott Robinson, who preserved peace and chose Menga, who just took the plan to the end.
Gerrard acted during the interim, switching Coulibaly Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost paid off when the frontier split up Morelos, but impressive Kelly fought to stop him.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the kind of game that suits them where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
The Holt side could have promoted its leadership at the end of the stage, but McGregor stood firmly by preventing Jacobs from hitting Lithgow from a big corner.
Glenn Middleton, the replacement player of Rangers, asked for a retreat when he went out with Jacobs, which Thomson did not satisfy again.
Almanahh: Geiger Counter inventor
And now page from our Sunday Morning Almanahh: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago and LOENDADES ... the day when the future physicist John Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. It was an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
From the beginning of this science, Geiger became the base of pop culture as in the 1950 film “Coronado watches”, where in the main parts they were seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
“What is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these earrings, it is possible to hear a bomb of minerals from radioactivity."
Evans: “Don’t tell me, it’s just going to hang out!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention of his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” fraudulent cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” fraudulent cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to be known as part of the treatment of fraudulent cells
The method includes the adoption of immunocells from the patient and the modification of these cells in the laboratory
Then they can “see” a common protein for many cancers and be injected back.
The vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancer.
In a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the detection of fraudulent cells to the immune system, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immunocells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory so that they can obtain a “sight” protein that has spread to various HER2 cancer diseases, and then they will be injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Institute for Cancer in Bethesdas Maryland explained: “Our results show that we have a promising vaccine.”
HER2 “directs the growth of many types of cancer”, including breast, ovaries, lung and colonectal cancer, explained professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach in which patients are treated with immunocells and are taught to target cancer cells has been used to treat certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West started with Trump's support tribe, wearing SNL directly in the MAGA hat.
It didn't go very well.
You will receive the Saturday Night Live studio at Kanye West’s deterioration, after his disgusting speech, in which he praised President Donald Trump and announced his application to the same position in 2020.
After that night his third song, which was named Ghost Town, and where he wore the hat with a letter Make America Great, he began to resist the more rigorous democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“I’ve spoken so much to white people who ask me, “How can you like Trump, he’s a race?”
“If I was so worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began with Matt Damon, where Hollywood's celebrity made a joke about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judges Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual violence.
Although this broadcast didn't go to the broadcast, west's noise scanners were loaded into a comic Chris Rock's social media.
It is unclear if Rock tried to look at the West post.
He also complained to the audience that he had a pretty hard time behind the celebrity of his hat.
“They fooled me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go there, hat in the head.
They fooled me!
And then they say I'm drowned in a place," he said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see a drowned place? I put on my Superman boiler because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love.”
His comments triggered the illusion of the viewers at least twice and seemed to be embarrassed by the SNL team. According to Variety, one person said, “The whole studio remained dead.”
West was brought to the show at the last moment to replace Ariana Grande because the singer's ex-boyfriend Mac Miller was dead a few days earlier.
West was surprised by many songs “I Love it”, which he looked like a Perrier bottle at the time of his presentation.
West received support from the head of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who shines: “To one courageous soul: We are here, that the JULGES would respond to the RAHVAMS.”
But the executive Karen Hunter shines that West was just “the one who he is, and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decided to honor someone who believes and disseminates the world view of my community (with my music or clothing).
He's free.
Like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “the former Kanye West.”
He is not the first singer to change his performance name, following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also, the rapper Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly divorced music legend Prince, who changed his name as a symbol.
Assassination of the Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with a murder attempt after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The police said the case was in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Supreme Court on Monday.
The prosecution is reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Troons game celebrity Kit Harington does not accept the book masking
Kit Harington is known for his sword-flaming role in Jon Snowina HBO's violent medieval fantasy series of Troons.
But the actress (31) lays down the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be rough.
Talking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought “something has gone wrong” and raised the question of how to solve the problem of the fake masculinity at the time of MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his Troon game with Rose Leslie (31), admits that he feels “very strong” that this problem needs attention.
“I personally feel that we have gone wrong with maleness,” he said.
“What have we taught men when they grow up in relation to the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that the rise in the masculinity of the bench is partly blamed for television, because there are supermale figures.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they need to be the same as they want to be men.
I think it's really one of the bigger questions of our time - how to change it?
'Cause something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the survey, he also admitted that after the end of the series, no one would ever participate in the order of the Troons, saying that he was “one side of his battlefields and horses.”
Since November, Kit Sam Shepard is involved in the revival of True West, which is a story of filmmakers and his robbery brother.
Recently, an actress said he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing about the game of Troons.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Emmy's award fantasy series for Ygritte, Kit's character Jon Snow lover.
In June 2018, a couple married Leslie in a family home in Scotland.
HIV/aids: China reports 14% of growth in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Healthcare workers say that more than 820 000 people suffer from this disease.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have arisen from sex, changing the past.
HIV spread in some parts of China through blood transfusions.
However, in this way the number of people infected with HIV was reduced to almost zero, and Chinese health officials confirmed at the conference held in Yunnan Province.
Over the year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people in China.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was lawd in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is allegedly large.
Due to the old values of the country, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are finally married to women.
Many disease transfers are related to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has allowed the use of the overall access to HIV medicines to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaking data of the employee's GOP Senator, saying that it's "satisfactory of falses" and "advisory theories"
On Saturday, the US representative Maxine Waters condemned the claims that his employee had posted to the Wikipedia pages of the legislators of three Republican US Senator personal data.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are distributed by “ultra-right” trolls and their websites.
“Vals, falses, and even more despairable lies,” Waters said in his Twitter statement.
The published information allegedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of senators Lindsey Graham (Luna-Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (some of Utahis).
Information appeared online on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Panel with regard to the statements of sexual transgression against the candidate Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court.
The information was leaked a bit after three senators had been questioned by Kavanaugh.
The old-fashioned websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address, which identifies the source of the post, was linked to Waters' office and issued information from the staff under Waters, said Hill.
“This unreasonable claim is complete and absolute wrong,” Waters continued.
“My employees whose identity, personal data and safety are endangered due to their fraudulent and false claims are not in any way liable for this information leakage.
This unreasonable claim is a complete and irreversible lie.”
Waters' statement was reviewed quickly on the Internet, including one of the authors of the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is due to anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he has an emotional nature that is not suitable for a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be angry.
They must not be trotting.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must remain calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was too angry by critics during Thursday's hearing.
The candidate of the Republicans, Omar Navarro, who will apply for Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It was because of the truth,” he shined.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities regarding these fraudulent claims.”
“We all do to find out the criminals,” he continued, “and that they would legally be responsible for all their actions that are destroying and dangerous to all my employees.”
Film Johnny English Strikes Again Overview - Reserved Rowan Atkinson Spy Parodia
Currently, Brexit’s meanings are being sought in all new British movies and it seems particularly appropriate in the parodia of Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011.
Are you humorous about yourself when we are obviously foolish in the new export option of the country?
In any case, inappropriate Johnny English has been allowed to do things once again in his hands - and that this wide comic creation is intended for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it is a secret agent who, despite his strange pretensive smuuti-glamor, reminds some of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Beani and a bit of a character who gave a voice to the story of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is also based on a traveler and an international mysterious Atkinson, once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television ads, leaving only chaos.
In this last JE movie there are only one or two pleasant moments.
I liked Johnny England's helicopter approaching when he wore medieval iron cloth and helicopter wings for a second, he rubbed against the helicopter.
Atkinson’s talent is seen to make a physical comedy, but humor seems less important and strangely over-excessive, especially when “white” spider movies such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer self-confident comedy.
It seems that this humor is more intended for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's fictional adventures are not both inventive and concentrated as atkinson's dark films as Bean.
Currently, the current assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker has invaded the UK’s network of highly secret spies, exposing the personalities of all British secret police officers, making a great disappointment to the local agent - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last beer for the Prime Minister, who is a party and in trouble character who suffers under the burden of political inpopulation: Emma Thompson does it greatly by Teresa-May, but there is not much in the manuscript to work on.
His intelligence advisers suggest that since all active spies are threatened, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a colonist in a proud institution, giving secret lessons about being a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers the School of Rock spion school.
English will be returned to Whitehall for emergency notification and reconnected with its former long-term partner Bough, who will be played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the disgraces of his Majesteed's secret service are re-acting, meeting Olga Kurõlenko with a beautiful femme fatale with Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the hand of charismatic techniques and billionaires. It claims he can solve all British computer problems: unhappy Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their jant odyssey: hiding themselves as waiters, they put fire on the French restaurant; they create chaos, smuggling the Volta luxury yacht on board; and English launches a genuine order when he tries to use the main set of virtual reality to meet the inside of the Volta house.
In this last section, no brakes are used, but as cute and storm as it is, the whole thing has a children's TV maic on the side.
It's quite a medieval stuff.
And, as with other Johnny English movies, I hit myself from the point of view: does the British film industry really have no role to give to Rowan Atkinson that would be fair to his talent?
The working party denies the preparation of a plan where the British are working four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
Jeremy Corbyn's Work Party has considered a reverse plan that provides that the British are working four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
The party wants the company’s superiors to transfer the savings received through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers, giving them one additional free day.
This would be a three-day weekend, but they would get the same salary.
According to the source, this idea would be compatible with the economic agenda of the Party, and so the country will be expected to be hugging for the benefit of workers.
The Thursday working week has been approved at the Congress of the Trade Union so that workers can use the changing economy.
The source of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “It is said that the review of the draft will be notified before the end of the year.
“This is not happening overnight, but the Thursday working week is an effort that is compatible with the party’s approach to economic balancing for both workers and the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The working party is not the first to support such ideas because the Green Party allowed a Thursday working week during its 2017 electoral campaign.
However, the effort is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The press spokesperson of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not the party’s policy and the party does not discuss it.”
Vice-President John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist turn in the economy.
McDonnell said he has decided to withdraw the power from the Communists “prospective leaders” and “profit service providers”.
The plans of the Deputy Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all their participation, as the Work Party could make “deductions” in relation to the misconception that is perceived.
It confirmed its plan to put employees into the company’s management boards and create ownership funds to provide 10% of private enterprises’ own capital to employees instead of providing annual bonus of up to 561,65 euros.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about 60 Minutes, whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their minds.
The investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has delayed the final referendum to the Riigikogu for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the Office could affect the termination of the support of the Republican Senators.
In the Sunday survey, you can get "60 Minutes" from Scott Pelley's Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could reveal something that could make them think of.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I was going to an interrogation, and I said I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked him, “Do you do that?”
He was decisive, confident and unimportant."
Graham's voice seems to be on the rock.
“I am confident in my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and can only be changed in a bomb,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how this happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“Everyone he has called could not confirm it.
That's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see anything new coming."
What is the Global Citizen Festival of Citizens and has contributed to poverty reduction?
On this Saturday, the annual music event will be held by the New York Global Citizen Festival, with a immensely impressive participation in celebrities and the same impressive goal: to lose poverty from the world.
Now, the seventh time Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn not only enjoying singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival launched in 2012 is the expansion of the global poverty project Global Poverty Project. It is an international lawyer group that hopes to end poverty, increasing the number of people fighting it.
To obtain a free ticket for a event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a number of tasks or voluntary activities, send an e-mail to some world leaders, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of losing poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been if there are still 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to act, or is it just another clicking trick where people feel that they are doing something important, signing an application on the internet or on the sparks?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" for its supporters, aiming to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than $37 billion of commitments and policies affecting the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 obligations and communications arising from their activities and of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have been directly affected by around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the partnership between investors and implementers in the United Kingdom, the Power of Nutrition, committed to “to help all children’s capabilities to exploit”, allowing Rwanda to give $35 million to help the country stop undernutrition after receiving more than 4700 shots from Global Citizens.
“In support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, like you, we can turn the subtle nutrition into a historical line of social injustice,” the Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ulman, said to the people of London during the concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5000 activities that called for the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing project of The Power of Nutrition, which reaches 5 million women and children in need of food intervention.
In response to a FAQ on our website, which asks: “What makes you think we can stop extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult way – sometimes we fall and fail.
However, as we face major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we are sure of our success because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are only a few performers who will take up this year in New York, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the "structure" of the Navy to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington Examiner says Washington may use its naval forces if necessary to avoid hitting the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, has been released by US Internal Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke argued that Russia's participation in Syria, especially if it works at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext in the investigation of new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to intermediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the southern European sky,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
“The United States of America has this opportunity through our navy to ensure that sea lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market,” he added.
Zinke's statement was directed to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance. It is a non-profit company that represents the voice of the US "energy consumer".
He went to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are basically the same.
"Iran and Russia's economic choice is more or less, boosting and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one trick pony", whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come when Trump’s government’s task is to increase exports of natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump, are attempting to convince Germany to expel the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin Moscow “convict”.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kreml claims that Washington’s acute opposition to the project has been motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy can not be a means of publication of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” said Russia’s Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak at a meeting with the US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has been retreated from Germany, who has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Union (BDI), called on the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and Berlin and Moscow bilateral agreements.
“I have a major problem if the third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, Director of the German Industry Union (BDI), following the recent German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering the candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts, said on Saturday that he was seriously considering the candidate for president in the mid-term elections.
In the Holyoke District of Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his application.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, and it also includes the first Lady,” The Hill said.
“In November 6, I seriously consider the candidate as president.”
Warren also assessed President Donald Trump’s activities, saying that “will lead the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” he said.
Warren has published criticism for Trump and its candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need FBI before we vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters do not think they should apply in 2020.
According to the survey by the University of Suffolk, 58% of the voters of Massachusetts believed that the Senator should not apply.
32% supported such candidates.
The survey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidates, 38% supported possible candidates and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to possible 2020 candidates include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that it was officially decided by the Associated Press by January.
Sarah Palin quotes Donald Trump in the collection of Track Palin PTSD
Track Palin (26) spent the year in Iraq since September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with the domestic violence case and was charged with
“What my son lives through what he experiences when he comes back, I can connect myself with other families who know the consequences and wounds of the PTSD that our soldiers return,” he told the audience at the meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsas Oktahamas.
Palin called on his son to be arrested as a “presidency in the room” and said in relation to his son and other war veterans, “they come back a little differently, they come back as a punishment, they come back in mind if there is enough respect for what soldiers and pilots and all the other soldiers gave to the state.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and President Dan Bennett of the Police Department of Wasilla, said he was accused of domestic violence against the women, in the report of domestic violence, in the intervention and in the possession of a gun in a drunken state.
The 18 states and the Columbia region dispute a new asylum policy.
Eighteen countries and the Columbia region support the legal challenge for a new U.S. policy that prohibits asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, 18 representatives of the country and the region submitted a brief statement of court friends in Washington to support the call for policy related to the asylum seeker, NBC News announced.
The full name of the applicant Grace v. Sessions in a smoke that the United States of America submitted against Union policy in August has not been published.
The woman said that her co-party “and her violent gang-related sons” abused her, but the US officials did not accept her asylum application on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
Grace's supportive national lawyers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries producing a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, among whom there are major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the decision of the Appeal of Immigrants in 2014 which allowed unauthorised migrants to flee domestic violence in order to submit an application for asylum.
In a statement on Friday, at the Prime Minister of Columbia, Karl Racine said that the new policy “fails decades of national, Union and international law.”
"The Federal Law requires all asylum applications to be resolved in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement violates this principle," the short statement of friends of the court said.
In the short statement, the lawyers also argued that banning immigrants is harmful to the US economy, saying that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “promote the necessary workforce”.
Attorney-in-law Jeff Sessions ordered migrants no longer to provide refuge to victims of domestic abuse and prosecution violence in June.
“The application for asylum is available to those who leave the home country because of persecution or fear in relation to race, faith, nationality, or a certain social group or political opinion,” the Session said in its Communication of 11 June.
The purpose of the shelter was never to mitigate all problems - even all serious problems - which people face every day.
Merrying rescue operations in the Palm where the deaths have doubled in the fight to find the survivors
The situation for the survivors was increasingly threatening.
“The situation is very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever at the evacuation centre of Palu’s small store.
“In every minute, new people come with an ambulance.
There is not enough clean water.”
The people returned to their destroyed homes by sorting things that were flooded and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by 7.5 magnetic earthquake were overloaded.
Some injured, including the crushed back and shoulder arm, Dwi Haris rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated in outdoor conditions due to strong post-retardations.
The tears filled his eyes when he remembered how a strong earthquake shaken his fifth floor hotel room, which he shared with his husband and daughter.
“It was time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed against the wall," said Haris Associated Press, adding that his family had come to a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're not in danger."
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for “humiliating with advocates”
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published four pages of the US daily news regarding the mutual daily benefits of US-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of the use of American journalism to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump referred to the addition paid by China Daily last Wednesday in Des Moines Register - the largest tirage of the state of Iowa - in the newspaper after China was accused of 6 November of the US Congress elections in intervention, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to intervene in the US elections marked what the U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common that foreign governments make advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where each other’s import tariffs are adjusted.
China’s countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were intended to hit the U.S. exporters, such as Iowa, because they supported the parties of the Republic of Trump, the Chinese and US experts have explained.
The U.S. Ambassador in China and the former Iowa Governor, as well as China’s largest agricultural exporter Terry Branstad, said that Beijing damaged American employees, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the Sunday Des Moines Register article: “China has now doubled his temptation by publishing advocates in our free journalism.”
“When it spreads its propaganda, the Chinese government uses American precious freedom of expression and the practice of free journalism, putting its payable advertising on Des Moines’ register,” Branstad said.
"On the other hand, there are only limited voices in the Beijing street, and there are no truly different opinions that the Chinese people may have about the worrying economic direction of China, given that the media is under the firm hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he added.
He added that one of the most outstanding newspapers in China refused to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that the Republicans alienate female electorates before interim elections with Kavanaugh fiasko
While many Republicans are waiting and defending the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of several sexual attacks, analysts have warned that they will see a retreat during the forthcoming interim elections, especially women.
The emotions around the situation have been in the ceiling and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go further by voting.
These things cannot be taken back," said the University of Syracuse, Professor Grant Reeher of the Maxwell School of Political Sciences published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubt that the last minute attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI is sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said the senior advisor of the progressive group MoveOn and the national representative Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC.
On Friday morning, protesters “coming in November” in their Senate corridor, because the Republicans who control the Committees of Judges decided to move on with Kavanaugh’s candidate, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic said.
“Democratic indices and internal indignation are going to stay out of the graphics,” Stu Rothenberg, an informal political analyst, told the newsletter.
People say it's already high, it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburban, and among the younger voters of the ages of 18-29, who often do not like and refuse to vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which described his claims on sexual assault against the candidate of the Supreme Court, analysts predicted a retreat when the Republicans were continuing with confirmation.
“This has become very confusing for GOP,” said Michael Steele NBC News, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of the last week.
“This is not just about the Commission’s vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is appointed, but also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it,” the Priorities United States (a group that helps to choose democrats) headed Guy Cecil’s attention to the newsteanal.
However, Americans seem to be slightly divided, who believe in Ford after the testimony and who support Kavanaugh, but a little more by supporting the first.
YouGov’s new survey showed that 41% of respondents believed in Ford’s testimony, probably, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh was probably lying during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford and at least another accusation of Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
In front of the Senate Judges Committee last week, Ford admitted that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed him his genitals when they attended a party in the 1980s during studying in Yale.
World Wide Web Inventor intends to start a new internet that would stick a chest with Google and Facebook
The World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee launched a start-up company trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the Technology Legend Inrupt is a company that builds the Berners-Lee Open Source Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have been given access to information.
In an exceptional questioning to Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal is “world rule”.
“We have to do this now,” he said.
“This is a historical moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their "personal online database" or POD.
This may include contact lists, tasks lists, calendar, music collection and other personal and competent tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available in one browser and at the same time.
This personal online database makes it unique for the user to choose who can access this information.
The company calls it “to grant personal powers through data”.
According to John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company would bring sources, processes and relevant skills to help Solid make it available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM-purchased security platform, some developers hired to work in the project, and a voluntary coding community.
Since this week, technology developers can create their decentralised applications worldwide using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to “Facebook and Google, whether to bring in a complete change when all their business models are fully supported overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post published on Saturday at Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
During the last few months, Berners-Lee has had an effective voice in the negotiation of the network's neutrality.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will be founded and director.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the Church of Victoria Crossed in World War I
In the first world war, the Church of England, who crossed Victoria, celebrated the 100th anniversary of his hometown.
Reverend Bernard Vann, Colonel, fought his award on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he died through the sniper's bullet and didn't know he had received the highest British army title.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday at Rushden in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be “genically symbolic” if the stone would be opened precisely 100 years after the award of the Grandpa’s fight.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, “through a very thick fog and rifles and ammunition guns.”
Later, he rushed into the attack line and carried it on with the “maximum galaxy” before he rushed alone to a single shooter, and three opponents snapped.
The German sniper was killed on October 4, 1918, when only a little more than a month had remained until the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s activity was “something I know I can’t ever repeat, but I’m always grateful for.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up after a parade led by Brentwood's congregational youth band.
Michael Vann said that he had “a great honor to participate in this parade” and added that “the presence and support of many people shows that the true hero can be evaluated.”
The MMA fans were Bellator 206 to watch up all night, but you only saw the Pork Peppa
Imagine you've been up all night to watch Bellator 206, but this main event will not show you.
San Jose's match included 13 fights, including six of the main cards, and it was shown on channel 5 in the UK throughout the night.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousas and Rory MacDonald prepared to stick to each other, the United Kingdom viewers kept their mouths on a ammunition, because the screen appeared in Põrsas Peppa.
Many were not excited about it, especially those who had stayed awake until early hours to see that battle.
One fan described the shift to children’s comics as “somewhat hurting joke.”
“It’s the government’s regulation that at 6:00 there was no longer a suitable content and they had to switch to the children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, the senior Vice President of Bellator on marketing and communication, explained when the transfer was asked.
"The Son of Peppa," yes.
Bellator President Scott Coker said that they are going to work on their schedule to take more account of the UK viewers in the future.
“When I think about the reintroduction, I think we can solve this problem in the future,” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 pm in the morning, we can’t do it before our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me when the program was changed, there was a lot of text back and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical disorder.
But it wasn't, it was the government's rule.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
Instead of six fights, we usually tried to give more fans, and we just passed over in time.
This is the situation of the axe.”
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley felt “small valued” in relation to sexuality.
Tom Daley from the Olympic Winner says he grew up feeling that he was less valuable than others because of his sexuality - but it gave him a motivation to achieve success.
A 24-year-old young man said he didn't realize until high school went, "Everyone is not like him."
When Lauren Laverne Radio 4 was broadcast by Desert Island Disc, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
He also changed his attitude to win the Olympic Games, giving the feeling that it is no longer so important.
You can get the usual long-term broadcaster Kirsty Young had to take a few months off due to his illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley told me that when she grew up, she felt less valuable than others, because it was not socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said, “To this day, these feelings are that I am not worthy and feel different, giving me power and strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was “nothing” worth, and that he didn’t disappoint others when they finally found out about sexuality.
The double pronx-olympia winner has become the leader of the highly rated LGBT campaign, using its appearance this year on the Games of the People's Community in Australia to turn to more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky that he could live openly without consequences and want to give hope to others.
The third world champion said that the fall in love to men - the American film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - “wired him as a surprise.”
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years old last year, but he said that the age difference has never been a problem.
"When you were so young," he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died cancer three years later - it was hard to find someone the same old who had experienced similar rises and joys.
In June, the couple became parents, having a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his “the entire prospect” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, everything was related to winning the gold medal,” he said.
But you know, there are more important things than the gold medals of the Olympics.
My gold medal of the Olympics is Robbie."
His son received his name after his father Robert, who died at 40 years of age in 2011 after diagnosing the brain tumor.
Daley said his father refused to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t say to him, “You can’t sit in the front line because you’re no longer there,” he said.
“I kept her hand when she stopped breathing, and only after she had actually finished breathing and died, I finally admitted that she was not invincible,” she said.
In the following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of the home population in the Olympic Games, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired her first singer - Heather Small Proud - which helped her prepare for the Olympic Games and still creates her chicken skin.

Mickelson was removed from Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson makes a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to improve his form to avoid unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays record 12 times every two years, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday couples and four balls.
Instead of being at the heart of activity, as he has often been for the United States, the fifth winner divided his day into two, being a stimulant and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hitter, even not at the top of your career, is not suitable for 48-year-old especially to play on a narrow Le Golf National golf field, where a long rough track punishes constantly misleaded blows.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will stand on Sunday, in his ninth competition, face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinar, who has joined forces with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four competitions this week.
If the Americans, who are behind the 12 singles at the beginning of the game with four points, start firely, Mickelson’s competition may be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he did not have much else to add.
“He fully understood his part of today, stabbed me on his shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk added.
“He is very confident.
He is a celebrity and has given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but that's how it went, and we had to choose that way.
He wants to be out like everyone else."
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo record on Sunday as the most Ryder Cup players.
It can celebrate the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which has never answered his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven five, but Furyk said that his presence has given the team an additional mental contribution.
“He’s funny, gracious, clever, he likes to have fun with people and he’s just great in the team room,” he explained.
“I think younger players had fun going to her this week and it was nice to see it.
He offers much more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great success can soon disappear.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that Ryder Cup's great leadership at the beginning of the single games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
The Danish appeared to the public at the 1997 competition in Valderrama, where, along with Captain Seve Ballesteros, five-point successes were held in front of the Americans, but when it reached the final line, it was dramatically reduced, the victory was received only with 141⁄2 : 131⁄2.
“You even remember that we had a great leadership position in Valderrama; we had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, this victory came very closely,” said Bjorn in the picture after the winning of Class of 2018: 3 Friday and yesterday at 10: 6 Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the team that it can be repeated.
You're going to do the best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points.
We have a goal of winning the cup and therefore focus on it.
I have always said, focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who are our opponents - the best players in the world."
Being pleased with his players playing on this difficult golf field, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to rush ahead of things.
Tomorrow there are completely new obstacles.
We read personal performances tomorrow, and so it is something else.
It's nice to be with the opponent, if things go well, but if you're there personally, you'll be tested as a golf player.
This is a message you need to send to players - give yourself the best tomorrow.
Now that you leave your partner, you have to go and take care of her."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players act better personally than with the opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got from four points three.
Furyk himself has experienced both of these last days, being part of the Brookline winning team, before becoming part of the loss, when Europe defeated “the miracle of Medinah.”
“I remember every damn word,” he said as a reply to the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 encouraged his players to put all their games on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we need to start with fire, like in Brookline and like Medinah.
If the hook goes in one direction, it will put a lot of pressure on the average competitions.
We set up our team accordingly and put the boys in the field in a way that we feel that this can happen tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the competition and he is best in response to Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the competition.
“I put my boys in this order because I think that’s how we’re properly covered,” Bjorn said from the choice of their individual games.
Germany’s new warship pushed on again
The German Navy’s latest high-speed sailing had to be introduced in 2014, replacing the aging cold war warships, but this did not happen before the following year due to the damaged systems and the increased cost of snowball, the local media reported.
The introduction of the new Baden-Wuerttembergi class "Rheinland-Pfalz" flagships has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the military press releases published in Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problem of worrying post-transmission did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
Four Baden-Wuerttembergi class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are replaced by the aging Bremen class’s rapid sailboats.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cabinet, a number of anti-aeroplanes, and some hiding technologies such as radars, infrared and hearing signals.
Other important opportunities include longer maintenance periods - the newest rapid sailings should be able to be sent out from home for up to two years.
Continuing delays, however, mean that high-level warships, which allow Germany to strengthen the power abroad, will become older at the time of entering service.
The unhappy F125 explosive sailor appeared in the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
It was the first time the Navy sent the ship back to the shipbuilder after its arrival.
The causes of return were little known, but the German media quoted a number of significant "software and hardware shortcomings" that made the warship ineffective if they were used in the battle mission.
The lack of software was particularly important, as Baden-Württemberg class ships are managed by a team of approximately 120 seafarers - only half of the workers of the older Bremen class.
It also revealed that the ship is considerably overweight, which reduces its performance and restricts the capacity of the Navy to add future innovations.
The 7000-tonne weighting "Rheinland-Pfalz" is probably twice harder than the same class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the whole project price will also become a problem, including the training of the team.
It has been said that it will be EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) - compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the newer radiation sailings become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is decreasing.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy had actually ended the “exportable ships”.
The official said that this theme has grown into snowball over time because the old ships were removed, but the replacement ships did not come.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttember class's high-speed sailors could not join the Navy.
National Trust Explores the Secret Life of Leather Shirts
The new study carried out in Scotland is designed to reveal how leathers use the landscape to search for their food.
It is hoped that the results give new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future protective measures.
The study of Scottish National Trust researchers monitors the usual and sopranic peppers in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-distances and Daubenton leather mice.
Special recorders are placed in the main places of the area to monitor the operation of leather mills throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers also conduct field studies using handheld sensors.
The competent assessment of all records determines the frequency and activities of the leather coats.
Then a map of habitats and a report will be created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS Nature Protection Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results show which habitats are the most important for leather mills and how different species use them.
This information will help to determine the usefulness of the management of habitats, such as the creation of mowers and how best to preserve forests for leather mills and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the area of leather mice has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitats and its disappearance.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flying papers and chemical processing of some construction materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Skins aren't really blind.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful to catch the harvest than their eyes.
They use complex solar and location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of the country are very serious about the leather.
They have ten trained experts who regularly carry out studies, inspections and sometimes save.
The organization has even created the first and only special leather reserve in Threave in Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight of the 10 types of Skotland live.
Real estate manager David Thompson says this area is an ideal area for them.
“In Threave we have a large area for leather mills,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a great place to live.
But there is still a lot to discover about leather mice, so the work we do here and in other areas helps us to understand better what they need."
He stresses the importance of checking leathers before starting maintenance activities in real estate, as the unwanted destruction of one place of pregnancy and childbirth can kill up to 400 mothers and young people and destroy even the entire local population.
Leather shields are protected and killing, disturbing or destroying them is illegal.
The Scottish Officer Elisabeth Ferrell has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said, “We still have so much to learn about our leather mills, and we just don’t know many of our species and how their surgicals feed.”
Ronaldo rejects rape accusations while lawyers are planning to appeal the German magazine to court.
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected rape charges for him as a “debted” saying that people “will want to advertise themselves” using his name.
His lawyers intend to appeal to the court the accusations of the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping American lady Kathryn Mayorga in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He has allegedly paid EUR 330 643,10 to avoid this incident, Der Spiegel announced on Friday.
In the Instagram’s direct video for his 142 million followers half an hour after the charges, Ronaldo (33) reported that it was “deceased news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
It's a false news today," Ballon d'Or's fifth winner told the news.
They want to advertise themselves through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all right," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo lawyers are preparing to appeal to Der Spiegel’s court on “promising unauthorized suspicion in relation to privacy.”
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would apply for compensation for “moral damage that corresponds to the difficulty of infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged case occurred in a Suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayor were allegedly returned to the player's hotel room where he was allegedly raped on the basis of documents submitted by the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged case and told him that he was “99 percent good man”, “one of whom one percentage falls down.”
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relationships, but it was not unanimous.
Mayor also claims that he went to the police and took photos of injuries in the hospital, but later agreed with an out-of-court solution because he was afraid of “payment” and was concerned about “public humiliation”.
Now the 34-year-old women say they are now trying to reverse the solution, as the alleged case continues to traumate him.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United during the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Italy for a transaction of EUR 100 million in the giant Juve.
Brexit: The U.S. may start regretting the departure of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom “two for ever” would lose its position as the world’s driver of the automotive industry after Brexit, said Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota YK had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop their production in the factory located near Derby in Burnaston.
“We have a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border crossing stations without the Brexit agreement can be paid for jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures vehicles in Toyota Auri and Avens, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that when the UK starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see the manufacturing process in our factory,” Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnaston Toyota, said.
Other UK car manufacturers are also afraid of leaving the EU without agreement, having concerns about cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in the absence of a Brexit agreement.
The Toyota production line works according to the need where the spare parts arrive from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement concluded on 29 March, there may be any interference on the border which industry has said could cause delays and some shortcomings.
Toyota would not be able to hold more than one day's stock at its Derbyshire factory, so production should be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers' plan for future EU relationships was “accurately calibrated to avoid such controls at the border.”
“We want the best solution to enable what we want and not only to use the current success, but the whole opportunity,” he said to BBC Radio 4 today.
“The facts of not only Toyota, but also of other producers show that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain set.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production was suspended, but in the long term warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately pay jobs.
For 24 years in Burnaston, President Peter Tsouvallar of Unite’s trade union said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from their experience that when jobs disappear, they will not come back.
The government press spokesman said: “We have submitted a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's major contribution to the meeting with prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be delayed for another week, as the fight against the highest-grade candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who examines the intervention of Russian elections, the links between the assistants of Trump and Russia and the obstacle to possible justice by the President.
Whether Trump fires the Deputy Prosecutor and thus threatens Mueller's independence, he has been generating Washington's rumors for several months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the use of hearing tools to record conversations with Trump and the possibility to remove the president through amendment 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm it.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, announced that he was going back.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting with Trump was announced, who was then in New York with the United Nations.
Trump said he did not want Rosenstein to be fired, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coincidence with the Senate Judges Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, gave both hours.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh, pushing forward the Senate vote.
Trump press spokesman Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When he was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it can be postponed for another week, taking into account all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let's look at it and keep me aware of the press as always."
Some journalists would argue that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Directed by Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of information hours was not due to the disappointment of TV journalists, although he added: “I do not argue against the fact that they have been disappointed.”
He then recommended direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President makes more questions and answers than any president before him," he said, without adding evidence, “We have looked at these numbers.”
Sanders said, “If the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this a lot and you've seen how we've done it in the last few weeks, so it's happening during the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week, the president in New York, perhaps, showed why, before the meeting of journalists on a free visit and sometimes with strange appearance.
The Ministry of Health wrote to EU employees in NHS Scotland regarding Brexit’s fears
The Minister for Health has written to EU employees in Scotland in NHS to express thanks to the State and wishing for their arrival after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent his letter when the UK has been released from the EU for less than six months.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the costs related to the status of EU citizens working in public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In summer, negotiations have continued on the resignation between the United Kingdom and the EU, heading towards its autumn expected decisions.
However, the UK government has also prepared a possible non-convention scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate each employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Professional partners from all EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit our serviced patients and communities.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie passed an emergency surgery after a headache
Tennessee State Tigers support player Christion Abercrombie passed an emergency surgery after Saturday's headache and defeated 31 : 27 Vanderbilt from Commodores, published Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's chief coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred just before the semester.
“He fell on the village and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Treeners and medical professionals gave Abercrombie oxygen while on the village before he was placed on the canderamic was transferred to the field for further inspection.
Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that the Abercrombie operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center has ended.
Harris added that there are no details of the type/disability of the injury, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student with a red shirt, was in Tennessee State in his first season after Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, which totaled 18 matches this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher temple fee when purchasing property in the UK
Foreign buyers must pay a higher temple fee if they purchase property in the United Kingdom using this extra money to assist homeless people on the basis of new Tory plans
This step makes Corbyn’s effort to attract young voters
Those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom shall be taxed by the Temple Tax
The Ministry of Finance hopes it will create up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers must pay a higher rate of temple tax if they purchase property in the UK using this extra money to help homeless people, Theresa May said today.
Movement is considered an attempt to make Jeremy Corbyn’s effort to attract young voters with promises to offer them affordable housing and target high-income people.
The Temple Tax is taxed on individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK by directing extra money to the government's desire to fight homelessness.
An additional fee - which is in addition to this Temple Tax, including higher levels established two years ago for purchases related to the second home and development - may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will create up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the purchased London property belongs to non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first buyers to get foot when buying their homes.
Many prosperous regions in the country - especially in the capital - have become “thumbing cities” thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time out of the country.
The new policy will only arrive a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple tax to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices when they purchase land but do not use it, and called on May to give up affordable home quotas in order to improve the shame of the UK’s “home related to housing”.
Corbyn has announced the reform of a remarkable residential economy, including lease control and ending the plundering of innocent people.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
May said: “In the first year, I promised that I would be committed to restoring the British dream as prime minister – that life would be better for every new generation.
This means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live here, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies located abroad, have as easy to buy homes as hard work on British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too far away, and the harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is the management of Scotland.”
Jack Ross, director of Sunderlan, says that his “final goal” is to be the leader in Scotland at some point.
Scotland (42) welcomes the challenge to revive the North-East Club, currently in League One, with only 3 points.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scotland Masters League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I reached class B, and that was limited," Ross BBC said to the Sportsound.
“But I grew up with my father watching Scotland in Hampden, and it’s always something that has pulled me back.
This option will only come when I’m in a successful club management.”
Ross's predecessors were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid of such big and well-known names, having previously endured both in Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, it’s a success that I can take this club to the League of Masters.”
Due to its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the League of the Masters,” he said.
“It’s not a easy task to get there, but I only see myself successful if I’m able to bring the club back to it.”
Ross has worked as a leader for only three years, in advance as Vice-President of Dumbarton and 15 months of Hearts' leadership staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling to the third level, making St Mirren’s lowest position a winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now when he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirkis, St Mirren and Hamilton Academicalis during his career.
“It was a real crossroad,” he recalled the takeover of Alloa.
“I really believed that leadership would be more suitable for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did it, got a reasonable income and enjoyed some of the top moments.
Playing can be hard.
There are many things to do every week.
I still experience this in terms of the tension and pressure of my work, but the management just seems better.
I’ve always wanted to drive and now I’m doing it. I feel more comfortable now than I’ve ever been in adulthood.”

According to the study, the best time for the film is Saturday at 17.30 p.m.
Summer heat has improved the turnover of the British pubs in trouble, but greater pressure has arisen on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the restaurants fell by 4.8%.
These figures were drawn up by CGA representative Peter Martin: “A long-term participation in the World Championships of Solar Floods and England meant that July was similar to June when the turnover of the pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, except that the restaurants went even more difficult.
In June 1,8% of the declined restaurant trading worsened even further in July.
Drinking-based pubs and bars traded the most successful and enjoying the lowest restaurants.
Food-based pubs also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurantkeepers.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sales of beverages between grey pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while food sales decreased by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, a free time and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The effects of weather and major social or sports events remain the biggest factor in selling outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although sales declines by 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year are particularly painful in addition to current price pressure.
Long and hot summer would not have been able to come at a worse time for food companies, and only time will show if the more moderate temperatures we’ve experienced in August give some essential relief.”
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of trademark-related authorities.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry’s sales monitor in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses 47 activity groups with total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, and it has become the benchmark of the industry.
One of the five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
The study concluded that one of the five children, some of them 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The study conducted in 20,000 gymnasists found the growth of “debt Insta” pages
The news raised the fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "basic account" for parents.
The study concluded that one of the five children, some of them are only 11 years old, creates secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
The study carried out among the 20,000 gymnasists found a significant increase in “debt Insta” accounts (figure to sharing images on Instagram).
The news raised the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “basic account” for parents as well as a “basic account” for their parents.
One discoverer of his 13-year-old daughter’s secret page saw that the teenager called on others to rape.
The Digital Awareness UK and the Organization of Headmasters" and Headmistresses (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and half of them recognized the existence of personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, HMC leader, said: “It’s annoying to see that so many teenagers are tempted to create accounts online where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes a sportsman at Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected head of the Executive Board at the annual meeting of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland’s most praised lightweightist and President Ian Beattie described what was happening as a good opportunity for sport leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidh is respected everywhere in Scotland, the U.S. and other athletes, and we are sure that Scots athletes will cut the benefit of calling his leadership,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I want to be an athlete speaker and hope I can make a real contribution to Scotland’s sport and contribute to its development.”
The American, who won atlanta’s Olympic Games in 1996 in 200 metres and 400 metres, now often shares its opinion in BBC, could not walk after a transitory ischemic atack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I got a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me if I was recovering and if, to what extent, only time will be shown.
I have worked hard, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again, and I’m already doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Breast pump advertising, comparing women with cows, distributes the internet into two
The company of the breast pump has shared the internet with two camps of advertising that compares to the milking cows of the breast-feeding mother.
According to the talks, the technology company targeted consumers to celebrate the “the first quiet breast pump in the world” published a similar advertising of Elvie’s ironic music video in order to present the freedom that this new pump provides for mothers who want to live.
The four true mothers dance in a table filled with the hay and sing, “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you don’t see my tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, they’re not umbrellas, they’re my breasts.”
The verse repeats: “Pump, pump, feed children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk.”
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company has created contradictory opinions on the Internet.
77,000 times viewed and thousands of reviews of video viewers have different opinions. Many of them say it illuminates the tent behind the dairy industry.
“The use of the pets to advertise this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to milk, but the difference is that children are stolen from them in counted days after birth,” wrote one.
Elvie Breast Pump does not squeeze from breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another commenter said: “It is reportedly traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use these children to advertise the breast pump of mothers who are allowed?”
“Someone added: Totally irrelevant advertising.”
One woman thought it was fun.
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I would buy myself one if I were still breast-feeding.
The pumping of milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but we take it as it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
The second commented: “This is a fun ad for mothers pumping and feeling like cows.
This advertising does not praise or condemn milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they have all danced in bras with non-speaking pumps.
The idea of a campaign is based on the saying that many women pump milk from breasts feel like a cow.
But Elvie Pump is completely quiet, there are no wires or tubes, and does not appear to the eye of the breast-feeding chest, giving women the freedom to move, keep children and even walk outside during pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and irritating presentation.
By comparing women’s opportunities for expression and the cows in the milk industry, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while presenting an extraordinary liberty in the entertainment and familiar key that the new pump creates.
This isn't the first time the news reflected the Elvie pump.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children carrying the product of the designer Marta Jakubowski appeared on the scene.
Thousands of Migrants’ children went quietly to the Texas border to the telescope.
The number of children in arrested migrants has risen sharply, although the monthly crossings have remained quite the same. Particularly because the hard retoric and policies enforced by Trump’s administrator have made it difficult with the help of children’s founding sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are migrants with documents and they are afraid to violate the possibility of continuing to stay in their country, so they require the right to care for the child.
The risk increased in June when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults belonging to the household could provide fingerprints and data are shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, an elder in charge of immigration and customs management, admitted to Congress last week that the agency arrested a dozen people who requested financial support for the minors not accompanying them.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons lacked a criminal past.
More than 80% of sponsors or sponsors’ household members are illegally staying in the country and a large number of them are criminal.
So let's keep tracking them," Mr. Albence said.
In order to deal with children faster, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest.
Many protect immigration from the judge through a video conference on their legal content, come to the place.
Inappropriate to release, they will be sent out of the country quickly.
According to asylum workers, and based on reports published in recent months - the longer the child stays in custody, the more likely they become nervous or depressed, which may cause violent demonstrations or attempts to escape.
According to the lawyers, these concerns are more effective in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where dropping into child’s difficulties can remain between two eyes due to the size of the child.
They added that moving children to the tent campus without leaving enough time to get used to or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many have already been in trouble.
Syria demands the immediate departure of the US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, although the country has been in war for the eighth years.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syria's surface were illegally precluded and treated accordingly.
“They have to leave immediately and unconditionally, he said in the Assembly.
Moualem argued that the Syrian “war against terrorism is almost over.” Since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue “the struggle in this holy war until we have cleaned the entire territory of Syria” from both terrorist groups and “any foreign force that is illegally present.”
The United States has around 2000 forces in Syria, mainly coaching and consulting Kurdish units as well as Syrian Arab Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 forces in the country of war.
Speaking of war refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are appropriate and he accused of unreasonable fears that prevent the arrival of refugees in the distribution of part of the Western countries.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help their neighbourhood,” he said.
“They politize something that is merely a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted recovery aid until there is no ending agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates the last rebel support point in Idlib, has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented the extensive capture of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “special deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would hit the soldiers of the Jews, including the Al-Qaeda-related Nusra Front, who would “destroy”.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convince the new committees of the first meetings of government and opposition members to plan the post-war Syrian constitution and to silence the way to election.
Moualem asked for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the present Constitution and warned against intervention.
Why Trump is also elected for the second term
According to this logic, Trump could be won in the following elections in 2020, unless the resignation and scandal have been completed by its presidency, as probably the liberal viewers want it.
What would undoubtedly be “the most exciting end of the presidency!”
At the moment, the viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the top-hour ratings have doubled by more than 1.05 million in CNN and almost three times in MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the top hour. Compared to the four-year-old 1,7 million viewers, the number of viewers has risen. MSNBC receives the “The Rachel Maddow Show” by 3.5 million cables, the viewer has kept this rating high during the main evening news.
“This is the tension we are involved in because we do not understand it,” said ABC’s drama “Designated Survivor” on a government secretary who becomes president when the attack destroys Parliament’s building.
Nell Scovell, who has experienced comedy writer and the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," author, is another theory.
He remembers the pre-election taxi ride in Boston.
The leader told him he was voting for Mr Trump.
“Why?” he asked
“He said he was making me laugh,” Mrs. Scovell told me.
All this chaos has a fun value.
Of course, not as the other TV shows, Washington’s rumors can become destiny to the future of Roe v Wade and to families and the global economy of migrants who want to reunite.
Avoiding the subject is only the luxury of viewers.
However, a six-hour talk of Bob Woodward’s "fictional background study" for his book "Fear" and Paul Manafort’s 13 225.73€ paid jaanalinnhasta Bomber jacket (Washington Post said this in "excessive self-confidence in a garment") and Stormy Daniels’ thoughts about the winning description of Mr Trump’s anatomy, the viewer is more than a well-trained citizen.
For example, I will never look at Super Mariod again with the same feeling.
“One of his activities, which may seem like a real life series, is that he shared something every night,” said the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the series “Panking Trenches” Brent Montgomery Trump with intermediate actresses and day-to-day plan holidays (even nordling with NFL, praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss any of the two eyes or otherwise you're out of time.
This week, when Fleiss met at his home, there was 80 degrees warm on the north of Kauai, but he had put in the room to look at MSNBC while saving CNN.
He couldn’t give up on seeing Brett Kavanaugh behave in the Senate Legal Committee and how the fate of the Supreme Court hangs on his hair.
“I remember doing all kinds of crazy shows in our time, and people said it was the end of the Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

The money flows go to the most acute White House intermediate selection.
It is no wonder that the 17th Pennsylvania district will receive a cash flow due to the restructuring of the congress area, giving two dominant companies to the same place.
As a result, the first number of the area of Pittsburg was re-elected from the Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb, who won the second district in the last spring emergency elections.
Lamb's opponent is the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the previous Pennsylvania 12 district, which in the larger section is overlaping with the new 17.
The maps were amended after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, and the old regions were divided into anti-constitutional election regions, in favour of the Republicans.
The new 17th election has triggered a campaign in which the financial departments of the largest political parties - the Congress Committee for Democrats (DCCC) and the National Committee for the Republicans (NRCC) trumped themselves with money.
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after the winning of the nappi many viewed in March 18, Pennsylvania Congress in emergency elections.
This place has happened by a Republican for decades, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political opinionmakers have given democrats a small advantage.
The US El Salvador was punished for China's support and then retired.
The diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, which was a small retreat to Washington.
Mr Trump met in a friendly atmosphere in June 2017 with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela and owned Panama hotel until partners threw out Trump’s administrative team.
The officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to return from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama from the American leaders of the diplomatic mission, as Heather Nauert, the press spokesman of the Ministry, said earlier this month that these countries had recently no longer supported Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was planned to be punished, who received 140 million dollars from America in 2017, including drug monitoring, development and economic growth.
The recommended penalties, including reducing financial assistance and targeting visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American State and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North America and Central America officials postponed a high-level consultation aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to arrange a similar meeting last year, which was seen as development in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, the high officials explained that they wanted to continue their consultation and to end the discussion of any El Salvador punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence will now be reviewed, who will speak at the mid-October meeting to talk about government positions.
And three American ambassadors returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new hard news or penalties in Washington.
The White House spokesperson of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details spoken by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national discussions on anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst who also spoke to the government on anonymity requirement.
History of study
The next may be that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller publishes a report on Trump's possible justice, a number of evidence in the state archive.
Mueller is also allegedly investigating in his study whether the Trump campaign is related to the Russian attack on our elections.
If the Congress should change the party, Trump must report in this institution as he would go back to talk to voters and perhaps even his elderly judges.
There are many butts here, and I do not want to point out that Trump or his European professionals are inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which affects the duration of the fight.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to reign against Hitler if only the West had prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We nurtured and missed the possibility of avoiding the following multi-year deaths.
History moves around such turning points and the uninspired route of democracy approaches or delays.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in spring water since it was announced that he proposed the secret recording of the president last year and speculated the incompatibility of that position.
Rosenstein says The Times statement is inaccurate.
“How to respond if the investigation by the FBI recently requested by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is reaffirmed to the Court of Justice despite reliable accusations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And in particular, will we vote for the Congress at the mid-election if Trump should be responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will take a long winter holiday.
But I think we don't fail because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was banished by Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever taken over and used our ambassador cottage.
He survived, immigranted to America, and 60 years later, he sent me a sabbath light on a table with a hammer.
With such a legacy, how should I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the battle of Rapid Vienna
Rangers will organize Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that you will win Australia, which was followed earlier at the beginning of this month to an impressive link against Villarreal in Spain, they will set a strong position to become a European League G group.
The knee injury did not allow the middle player Graham Dorrans from the first appearance of the season before 2 : 2 games ended with a delay against Villarreal, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for better results.
“It was a good point for us because Villarrea is strongly opposed,” said 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game, believed that we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Maybe we could have achieved more, but it was generally a fair result.
They were better at the first half of the game and we were the second half of the game again.
Thursday will be another big and important night in Europe.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they received a good result in their last game, but since the people support us, I am sure we can gather ourselves and get a good result.
Last year was hard, thanks to that, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all feel good inside.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can move on, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Women cannot sleep because of the fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husbands about long-term care costs.
Only 10% said he had spoken to his children.
“People want family members to take care of them, but at the same time they don’t talk about it,” explained Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nationwide’s life insurance activities.
This should be started.
Talk to your husband and children: You can’t prepare your family to care if they don’t know your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and family, discussing where and how to get care, as these options can be extremely important in relation to costs.
Please consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan to pay for their costs.
For example, your financing opportunities for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance policy, hybrid financial value life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop any possible legal battles already in the eos.
Beware of the health care authorisation to determine a trustee who would monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow up during your request if you cannot communicate.
Also consider a trustee with regard to your financial assistance.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapable.
Do not forget the small details: imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions related to medicines and allergies?
Write down these things so you can be ready if necessary.
“It’s not just a financial side, but it’s also important who would be doctors?” Martin explained.

Ilfracombe was shot several times from an air gun.
There were several shots from the master's coat when he was out of town after he was spent the evening on his way home.
In the 40s, the victim was shot in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, in Devon, into the chest, stomach and hands.
The police described the shooting of about 02.30 at night as a random act.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police ask all witnesses to contact.
Earthquakes and tsunamies in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Indonesia on Friday, the officials announced that the number of deaths continues to increase.
Since the connection has been broken, the rescuers have not received any information from the Donggala regents on the north side of Palu, which remains closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnetic earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala in the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawes, located on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, and the population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was suddenly hit by earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala regents are a region that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) to the northwest of the island of Sulawes.
The Regense, which is an administrative area under the province, was estimated at 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawes Province, especially the Donggala coastal region.
In the Provincia, it is also important to extract nikkel, which is mainly concentrated on the opposite coast of Morowal, Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Disasters Agency, tsunami has hit Palu and Donggala several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people killed tsunami in Donggala and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, the tsunami hit the west of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is standing in the light circle of the Pacific and it is regularly hit by earthquakes.
We will bring the largest earthquake and tsunami in the last few years:
2004: On 26 December, the major earthquake in Indonesia on the West Coast of Acehi Province of North Sudan triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and in early April, several strong earthquakes hit the Western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the Sumatra coast.

More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: 7.5 degree earthquake hit one of the Sumatra islands - the Mentawa island, triggering up to 10 metres of tsunami that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The deep earthquake hit Pidie Jaya regents Acehis, in sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the death of the 2004 earthquake and the destruction of the tsunami.
At that time, more than 100 people were killed in collapsed buildings.
2018: Greater earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily abandoned thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
The oldest son of Track Palin, former Governor of Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to the report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin (29) was arrested in the State of Alaska in relation to the suspicions of domestic violence, intervention and arrest of domestic violence.
According to the police report, when a woman attempted to inform the police of alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin is kept in Mat-You's pre-exploratory facility and is held against a $500 unsecured bail, announced.
He appeared to the court on Saturday, where he declared that he was “no fault,” the news network reported.
Palin faces three A-class misdeeds, which means that he can be expected to be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $20,000.
He is also accused of a B-class misdemeanour, punishable by one-day imprisonment and a fine of $2000.
This is not the first time Palin was charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
With regard to the alleged attack, the police invited his mother Sarah Palin.
The case is currently being discussed in Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assaults, domestic violence reports of intervention and possession of a weapon, all in alcoholic state.
His friend said he was hit in his face.
The Veteran groups criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 when he associated his son’s violent behavior with PTSD, which was due to his service in Iraq.

NYC federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death penalty suspected in the terrorist attack
New York's federal prosecutors are seeking a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, which killed eight people. This rare punishment has not been executed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle road along the West Side roads on Ala-Manhattan, in October, both on its way to pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the application for a death penalty in the southern New York region, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight victims intentionally and also caused serious body injury.
In both cases, on the basis of judicial documents, a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal convicts throughout Saipov filed a 22-point accusation, including eight murder charges, along with extortion, generally used by federal prosecutors in organised crimes, and accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack was called for “intensive planning and planning,” the prosecutors said, describing the activities of Saipov, “scient, cruel and disgusted.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and damage to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco family and friends," he said.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
The last case of death in the South of New York District District District District Court has been over ten years.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to the murder of two drug traffickers, but as a result, he was sentenced to lifetime prison in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's federal case, when the couple was executed after a conspiracy in order to carry out a spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an indigenous stagger, showed lack of regret in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he had told the researchers that he was pleased with what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack to the ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted the ISIS flag to be released in his hospital room.
In the 22-point accusation, he has not taken charge.
David Patton, one of Saipov's national defendants, said they were “selfly disappointed.”
“We believe that the decision to apply for a death penalty will extend the trauma of all the persons involved in life, without the possibility of being released,” said Patton.
Previously, the Saipov Defense Force asked the prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
According to Mr Tory, NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage allowed the protest of the Tory conference to “mobify the armed force.”
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to feel “heat” for euroskeptians because one of Theresa May’s own Members suggested that they lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a conservative sub-house simplicist, said on Marsil in Birmingham, that the UK “was already outside” if Mr. Farage was Brexit’s secretary.
However, Mrs May faces the problem in reconciling his deeply fragmented lines, which were highlighted by the conservatives that supported the stay, joining his protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is in trouble keeping his Chequers plan on the ground in the midst of Brexit's supporters, residents and EU attacks.
The allies demanded that they continue the transaction with Brussels, despite the contradiction and force euroskeptics and liberals to choose between their package and "chaos".
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihulli that he wanted to “refrain from Chequers’ plan”.
He recommended to take Farage as a partner and to give him responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"We'd be out of charge now," he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: "I'm standing outside of Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers' plan."
In reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in World Wars to be subordinated.
We want to create our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The opinion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.”
Tory Brexit's supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the marching and told the reporters: "I'm saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“Chequers’ plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular among our political parties and our activists who actually walk along the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message directed to May, he added: “The ministers can keep their job if they stick to their promises.”
Farage said that politicians at the meeting must be put to “heating” when they intend to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let it happen.”
In the message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to put our political class on the edge of the betrayal of Brexit uncomfortably.
“We mobilize the national army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, municipal, proud UK.”
At the same time, the remaining members marched through Birmingham before the two-hour gathering at the heart of the city.
A handful of activists flipped the "Towers against Brexit" stories after creating a group this weekend.
Lord Adonis of Liberals mocked conservatives about the security issues that became part of their party’s application in the opening of the conference.
“They are people who say that IT systems can be set up and all technology can lead to Canada and more, smooth crossing, cross-border trade to Ireland,” he added.
“It is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering being a president
According to US Elizabeth Warren, he is seriously considering the president after the elections in November
Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts’ Democratic Democrats spoke of his future on Saturday at the West Massachusetts Railhouse.
Warren, President Donald Trump’s frequent critic, will apply for the following elections in November against GOP’s National Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of Trump 2016’s Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that it may be against Trump in 2020.
The afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters in the district of Trump.
The deputy asked if he was going to be a president.
Warren replied, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, which means that it’s also on the front page.”
LSU Sims was arrested in the shooting
LA Police at Baton Rouge announced on Saturday that the suspect was arrested by LSU basketball player Wayde Sims' shooting death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson arrest at 11:00 a.m. at the ET News Conference.
They released a video of Friday shooting, asking for help to identify a visible man.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University in the early morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet wound in the head and died after that," police chief Murphy J. Paul said to the media on Saturday, 247sport.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and got a bullet from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and he admitted to being at the scene, holding the gun and shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Approximately 2-metre young man Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of them in the original form, on average 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 tableballs per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after the team record gave him the victory over Sebastian Vetteli
From this moment it was clear that Valter Bottas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton that the Mercedes team's order plays a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and left Hamilton almost forgotten when he first defended his position and invited Vetteli to attack his teammate.
At the first time, he went to boiler stops and left the Hamilton group behind in a tight traffic that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boiler stop later and came out after Vetel, but Hamilton went to lead after his position, when Ferrari's leader left the inner side to get free after the third corner attempted to protect it with a double movement.
Max Verstappen started the competition on the back of the square and was at the end of the first round at the end of his 21-year-old birthday.
He then led the competition for most of the time, traveling to the finals of the rubbers and passing from Kim Räikkönen, taking the fourth place.
He finally drove to a box stop on the 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which gave Räikkönen the fourth place.
Today is a difficult day because Valter did a good job all week, and he was a real gentleman with me.
“The man has done a great job to have one of the two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very poor body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday's gathering because he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he was accused of nominating Brett Kavanaugh in sexual harassment.
When speaking to the West Virginia assembly, the president did not directly address the testimony given to Ford before the Senate Legal Committee, but instead commented on what was happening at the moment in Senate, which shows that people were “nasty, disgustful and false.”
“The only thing that may happen in the moment that has happened in Senate in a few days is that you see anger and angry, wicked, disgusting and false people,” he said.
“When you look at press releases and leaks, they say, “Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question, ‘Do you leak the document?’ – “Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added with the look of the senator.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein on the charges against Kavanaugh in July and was leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his job.
The Hill said, “I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s charges or leak his story,” Feinstein told the Committee.
“He asked me to keep confidential and, according to his prayer, I did so.”
But his denial was not suitable for the president who commented at the time of the Saturday gathering: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's one of the worst language I've ever seen."
By continuing to protect the candidate of the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse of three women, the president suggested that democrats use these charges for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take the power back without choosing resources.
You see this nasty and disgust. They don’t care who they are going to hurt, who they need to drive over to gain power and leadership,” said the President of the Media.

The pilot dies to save hundreds of people from earthquake
One Indonesian airline driver was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure a safe rise in the airplane carrying hundreds of people.
On Friday, the great earthquake hit the island of Sulawes caused a tsunami, resulting in which more than 800 people were killed, many of whom have lost unknown.
Strong trails of the region and many people are trapped under the ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung colleagues escaped the volatile tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, he refused to leave.
He stayed at the office to ensure a safe rise in flight No 6321 at the same time on the airline.
Then he jumped out of the tower and thought it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia Press Officer Yohannes Sirait confirmed that his decision could save hundreds of lives, an Australian ABC News.
We put a helicopter ready to transport him from Kalimantan to another city's major hospital.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning, before the helicopter got to Palus.
“We were extremely sad when we heard of it.”
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can increase to thousands. According to the National Disaster Relief Agency, access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
Agent Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: “The number of deaths can increase because the bodies of many victims are still under the ruins and have not been saved.”
The 6-metre waves ruined the city of Palu, where the massage takes place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes offer assistance and equipment.
A 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: “Cirabi will bring new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
There are small markets all over the world."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia said to CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help the survivors, but we can’t tell what they can find.
It's already a tragedy, but the situation can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palus on Sunday and said to the state army: “Please work nights and days to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready for this?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Lomboki in Indonesia hit an earthquake where more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia flight accident: Air Niugin airline said one man was missing after the flight accident in Lagoon
Although it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were evacuated from a safely drowning plane, the air carrier who led a plane falling into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia claims that one man is missing.
Air Niugin said in his statement that since Saturday afternoon they couldn’t find one male traveler.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find a man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to the details of the passenger, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and teams after the plane landed at the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, the officials said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The facts of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed far from the Lagoon airway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was crossing the plane.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
“It’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to suppress a drowning plane to an emergency exit in a belt height water.
He mentioned that the cabin crew had panicked and screamed and had a little headache.
The U.S. Navy and seafarers who worked on the nearby yard also helped to save people using full-dry boats to take people to the shore before the plane fell underwater about 30 meters.
Aeronautical safety network data indicate that 111 people have died in air accidents related to air carriers registered to PNG over the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
Analyst prepares the schedule of the evening when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed the case for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spent several hours as an expert survey in the analysis of intelligence data.
He explained to the jury how he used the records of mobile phone calls that the 29-year-old alleged Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers movements during the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to the earlier claims of a young man.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the court on Saturday and admitted that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had spoken the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis “were lying because my car was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
The records of the phone showed that women knew each other only a week.
Rowlett argued that some time after Chambers died, the Order deleted the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
“He erased her from her life,” Hale said.
Defense is planning to make his trial on Sunday.
The judge said that he believed that the case would go to the jury after the same day.
The High Breed: what is known for hiphop?
Hiphop trio wants to fight negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed from Bristol argues that the hiphop has been dismissed from the beginnings of its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the hipop roots and make the conscious hiphop again popular.
Bands such as The Fugees and Common have recently reconstructed popularity in Britain thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
New York's babysitter complains about a racist message after a couple of courts
New York's grandchildren complains about the dismissal of discriminating in court after a couple of times in the family, where the mother complained that her babysitter was “continuous black.”
Couples deny that they are racists compared to extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed his disgrace when he found out that Giselle Maurice was black when he first came to work in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to his husband, saying, “EIIIIIIIIIIIIIII, MUSTANAHALINE, MUSTANAHALINE.”
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt uncomfortable after his prohmaka understanding to Ms. Maurice, claimed that their social guardian, who was African-American, had done a bad job and had been waiting for a filippinian instead.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice appeals to a couple of courts to get compensation for the release, which he wants to receive every day in the sum of $ 350 for the next six months, and the same work he was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
“I want to show them to see, so to do,” he said to The Post, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
A couple have rejected the claim that they are racists, saying that terminating relationships with Maurice was a reasonable thing because they feared they could no longer trust him after insulting a lady.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t think.
He's not a race.
“We are not racists,” said the wife’s wife’s husband Joel Plasco newspaper The Post.
“But would you give your children to keep the person you’ve been rude, even if it was unwilling?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison of extortion, Plasco said that her wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was “in a very difficult situation”.
“Would you go against someone like that?
It's not very nice now," the investment banker added.
Although the case continues, the public opinion has condemned a few quickly in the social media where they are highly evaluated because of their behavior and thinking.
The new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers feared that the readers did not interact with the talking bear.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, born right after the book was adopted, said: “It’s difficult to put himself in the shoes of a man who read it first before publication.
It’s very fun to know what we know about the great success of Paddington.”
He said that his father, getting an inspiration to write a children's book of a small game, working as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic after rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the issue was a nucric shadow because of the death of his father last year.
About Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member in our family,” he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man and was not a proud man,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real for him, it was as if your child had accomplished something: you are proud of them, although it is not your achievement.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
In the landscape, his daughter was taken to Nice Hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“They called regularly to say that the situation of the daughter was very bad and that they don’t think he will survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad, who said my daughter will die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did it.
I said, “Tashi, dear, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medications that the doctors gave him to continue to punch his heart were beginning to disappear quietly and leave the body.
He was dead a while before that, and now all the systems began to stop working.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what's going on.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her daughter, went to a plane with other travelers who did not know anything about her life.
“No one knew that,” he said.
“I kept my head down and tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but on this flight, I felt a terrible sympathy for Nadi.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved him."
Postcards of a sorrowing woman prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their beloved suicide rabbits work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have dressed cards on the Wales Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Miss Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he suffered depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
“I don’t want any older to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everybody knew about her smile.
They always said that his smile makes the whole room shine.”
Despite this, he stopped working before his death because he “was in a very bad place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his brother after he had taken his life.
Mrs Davis said, “I’m constantly concerned that it has a dominant effect.”
Ms. Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to contact and talk to, even with his friend.
Don't shut up, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend with Mrs. Davis for years, lost Marki, a partner with his 15 years not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything,” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
During the first Christmas he was at his lowest point – when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything.”
Ms. Humphreys said that the death of a man was a terrible trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: “It tears the wound into the whole family.
It's going to cut us apart.
But we have to go on and continue to fight.”
If you have difficulties in dealing, you can call the Samaritans for free at 116 123 (Suurbritannia and Ireland), contact jo@samaritans.org or go to the Samaritan website here.
Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on the hair while the FBI starts investigating
“I believed that if we actually got something he wanted – a limited study of time and extent – we might be able to achieve unity,” Mr. Flake said, adding that he feared that the Committee would “continue” in the middle of a permanent blockage of the partisans.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate it?
Their opposition was due to the era.
If the Republicans do not go well, they will be weakened in their intentions to become the desired man for the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call Senators, doing lobby work to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
The vote will take place in a Senate with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive voice and to affirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean force runners "decreases" under Kim's government
South Korea's legislation has been said that the number of North Korea's troops in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted by the Ministry of Convergence in South Korea, said that compared to the 2011 force runners (2706), the number of them has declined last year (1127).
Mr Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a greater number of traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
South Korea has been offered a large number of North-West Runners.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest national border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than a strongly protected demilitarised area located between two Koreas.
China is taking forces as illegal migrants rather than as refugees, and often sends them back to the country with power.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally promised to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the Foreign Minister of North Korea accused Ri Yong-ho the United States of America of the lack of success in sanctions.
“Untrusted to the United States, our country has no security, and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to unarm ourselves unilaterally,” Mr Ri said in his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelos called Brett Kavanaugh "hysteeric" and said that he was unsuitable to judge the Supreme Court
The president of the Chamber of Representatives Nancy Pelos called Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysteeric" and said that he was temperamentally inappropriate to work as Judge of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave an opinion on a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I noticed inevitably that if a woman had appeared in such a way, he would have been called hysterical,” Pelos said about his reaction concerning the testimony given to the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally the accusations that he had been sexually attacked by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, describing his family and high school years, he almost shouted from time to time, and was sometimes unspeakable.
He also explicitly condemned the members of the Democratic Party in the Committee by appointing Hillary Clinton’s charges for the loss of the 2016 presidential elections organised by angry liberals as a “grotesque and coordinated main murder”.
According to Pelos, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony has proven that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was hugged against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with their statements and the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
Pelos remained modest when he was asked whether he would try to get him out of office when he was confirmed by Kavanaugh if the democrats were to get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m saying so much – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only suitable for the Supreme Court’s judge, but he’s not suitable for the court in which he is currently working,” Pelos said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the appeal court of the Columbia District.
Pelos added that as a democrat, he is concerned about the decisions against Kavanaugh’s possible Affordable Care Act (the Health Act – a comment from the translator) or Roe v Wade (the legal presidency of the abort – a comment from the translator) as a conservative judge.
At his confirmation session, Kavanaugh avoided asking questions about whether he would cancel some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“It’s not a time for a hysterical person to become a judge and wait for a word from us to see if it’s not nice,” Pelos said.
And women have to wear it.
It is a fair expression, a six- and-year-old overflowing anger, and he will not be able to cry.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms Steinem said 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do I?”
He continued: “I got help from a woman who was a leader somewhere; he said that he was crying as well as when he became angry, but he developed a method that stood in that when he became angry and started crying, he said to a man he was saying, “You can think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And he just continued.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partially accepted as a rage exit because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is from an early job in a large majority of men's office where I once found the unspeakable rage crying when one of the older women - a strict leader I always had a little feared - dragged me from the crawl and the staircase.
“Don’t ever show them how to cry,” he told me.
“You don’t know you’re maruvihant.
They think you're sad and it'll give them satisfaction."
Patricia Schroeder, the congressman of the Democratic Party of Colorado, had worked together with Gary Hart in the presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart intervened on board a hunt called Monkey Business, and the campaign ended, Schroeder deeply thought that there was no reason why he would not think of the candidate himself.
“It wasn’t a well-designed decision,” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
“The last thing they needed was joining someone else.”
Someone said it was like "Snow White and seven thumbs."
Since the campaign was over, he was late with the money collection, and he promised not to apply for two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave him $250.
“Do they think I can get a discount?” he said.
When he held a speech in which he announced that he did not launch an official campaign, the feelings – thanks to the people who supported him – the irritation of the system that made it difficult to return to the voters instead of money collection and delegations, and the anger against sexism – he was so defeated that he had become tears in the throat.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the reaction of the press against him.
“I could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they write on my tombstone.
“He was crying?”
How the US-China trade war can be useful for Beijing
The opening breaks of the trade war between the US and China were complaining, and although the battle is far from over, experts say that the cross-border gap may be useful for Beijing in the long run.
President Donald Trump made the first warning this year by taxing significant Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs for goods worth $200 billion (150 ml pounds), which are essentially taxed on goods from China to the United States.
Beijing has always responded to the same, charging the last five to ten percent tariffs at a value of $60 million to American goods.
China has promised the United States to respond to a shot shot, and the world’s second size is likely to not be seen soon.
Getting back to Washington would mean a resignation of demands, but publicly worshiping the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that when Beijing’s cards are correct, the trade war with the United States can support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that cause the loss of control over the economy in another country is actually much more dangerous than the outsiders have previously recognised,” said researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on Asia’s investigation at the Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister said Syria is ready to return refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for the reconstruction of the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would improve.
“The situation is now more stable and secure in the territory of the country thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore the destroyed regions of terrorists to bring normality back.
Now, there are all the conditions for refugees who have left the country, as a result of unilateral economic measures affecting terrorism and everyday life and living, to return to the country voluntarily.
According to UN estimates, 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still need humanitarian assistance in the country.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to build a degraded state.
However, he stressed that the State would not receive conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the rise.
Europe took the Ryder Cup Championships in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cartoon Championships, defeating France near Paris at the Le Golf National golf field with the end result of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on the European surface and has not won Ryder’s cups in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again received the crown, when the Danese Captain Thomas Bjorn team became 14,5 points needed to win the United States.
During the whole tournament, the American star Phil Mickelson shook a brick on the pa-3 track 16 waters, giving up the winnings to Francesco Molinar.
Italian golf player Molinar shines in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have achieved the result in the current form of the tournament in 1979: 0 :0.
The American Jordan Spiethile scored 5&4 of the lowest positioned Danube Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, promoted an English Ian Poulter with 2 and 1, to whom the Ryder Cartoon Championship could last.
Eight of Ryder's Cartoon Championships veterans, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the most winning European in all times.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold myself back.
It's been a hard year.
I am grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so glad we got the cup back.
It’s a team’s instinct, and I’m glad to be able to help,” said the emotional Garcia after Europe’s victory.
He's going to be happy with Jon Rahm, who won a single game on Sunday in the US golf game Tiger Woods 2&1.
“I know extraordinary pride that I won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him,” said Rahm, a 23-year-old.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now he has a career in Ryder's Cartoon Championships score 13 : 21 : 3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players in all time who won 14 big competition titles, leaving Jack Nicklaus alone.
The U.S. team was a bump to find fairways throughout the weekend; the exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointment of the team, Captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of the guys, they were snacks.
We had a moment of pressure for Europeans in the morning.
We fought with them.
A hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players did a great job.
Let's get together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cartoon Championships Committee and go on.
I love these 12 guys and I feel proud to be their captain.
We need to pick up the hat.
“We were better played.”
New information on water flow: concentration decreased in Pinella, Manate, and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Living Commission (FWC) shows the overall reduction in the concentration of flourishing wets in the Tampa Bay region.
According to FWC, there are reports of shorter prosperity in Pinellase, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which refers to decreasing concentrations.
The water flow is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of the Pinellas county to the south of Lee county.
The sites can be found 10 miles (16 km) away from the Hillsborough county, but less places have been found compared to the last week.
Water flow has also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the average concentration on the coast or open sea of the Pinellas county has been reported in the area of Hillsborough County from low to high concentrations on the open sea, from background to high concentration in the region of Manatee, from the coast of Sarasota and on the open sea, from background to medium concentration in Charlotte county, from the coast of Lee and the open sea, and low concentration in Collier county.
Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties will continue to report the irritation of the respiratory paths.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in Northeast-Floridas over the last week.
