I'm shocked.
Will this affect me?
I always drink two cups of coffee in the morning.
I grabbed Tom at the elbow.
I don't know where Tom's umbrella is.
That's the last one.
I ran to the station this morning.
That was great.
Maybe I'll eat it later if I'm very hungry.
Is there anything between you and me?
Don't ask why, just do it.
My dream is to be a teacher.
It's very nice of you.
What time do you have breakfast?
Smell this flower.
There had to be a reason for this.

Who's staying?
I want to study French next year.
I'm terribly rude with kids.
Tom is 13, but he still believes in Santa Claus.
Why don't you sleep yet?
I hope I see her again.

It worked beautifully.
There are more houses behind the houses.
The sea was full of boats.
The parachute fell into the ocean and drowned.
Please don't go.
Tom can't stop it.
I had doubts.
Is this dangerous?
Tom's gonna pick Mari up at the airport.
He lives in another state.
I work to live, but I don't live to work.
Be right there.
He knows everything about cooking.
I gave my father a ringing box for a gift.
Does Tomi call Mari?
He was formed in a way that was autodicating himself.
Tom knew everything.
Come out with me.
I can't forgive you.
I think you called the wrong number.

Did I miss him or not?
The modern man will no longer succeed without a car.
Help is on the way.
Use this information well.
I saw something.
Can I make some suggestions?
Mary was looking for you at the time.
I found a place to live.
Where's Tom going to take pictures?
Get some nassi.
None of us are cowards.
It's not a full story.
What are these for?
His parents were outside the city.
And what can you show me for that?
How long has Tamás been here?
This is grape wine.
He speaks honestly.
Tomi knows a lot about Mari.
What is 67 square roots?
They kidnapped me.
Those girls are very busy.
Are you sure you're okay?

I read a letter.
We're satisfied.
Good doesn't mean he's smart too.

I tried to sleep.
I can treat kids well.

I don't want to work; what if we go to a movie instead?
You should look at the cake.
It's such a sparkling music.
I have to change.
This manga is very popular in China.
I'm going crazy.
Today, we want our children to make independent decisions, but we expect these decisions to comply with us.
I'm afraid of pussy.
I always knew this day would come.
I'm glad you liked it.
Mari's been confronted with you.
Tom retired many years ago.
It's half an hour for lunch.
Red alert!
It's not working.
Are they thirsty?
He insulted her.
Tom was just staring.
They drink too much.
What color are your hair originally?
Who founded the Google Translator?
Mary asked Tomi what his opinion was.
They're big.
I doubt you'll remember.
The poison ran away.
They swore six months ago.
Should I take you somewhere?
Tom's deaf.
Tom is rich.
I killed him during anger, it was not a pre-reasoned murder.

Can I introduce you?
All his money was sold.
How nice.
I need to talk to him.
It's cold.
Tom's got Mary's name.

Good sense of humor helps in difficult situations.
Got it?
We can meet.
That'll be interesting.
Are they gone?
I have black hair.
Yesterday was hot, but today it was lighter.
We need to warn Tom.
I'll see you sometime next week.
Stop it.

Have you ever been to Petanque?
There's a lovely sock.
I didn't figure it out.
I can't follow your logic.
What would you like to do in the future?
Tom's safe.
We understand the target.
No one was there.
All my questions have been answered.
I knew you'd get in trouble.
Tomi has a guest.
I feel sharp chest pain.
I'm willing to risk it.
How can you say that?
I don't want to sleep.
I don't believe a word about it.
My birthday is in November.
Did you guys behave well today?

I'm going to see my friend.
Stop yelling.
Time will depend quickly if you read something.
Tom thinks fast.
My dream is to be an artist.
My suitcase is lost.
I like sleeping.
The fruit is in the basket.
I love cheese pizza.

I'm Israel.
They entered the forest.
How the hell can you wait for me to pay for that?

If I hadn't had the map, I would have lost it.
I think he's coming.
It's tomorrow's night.
Tamás left-handed?
Can you tell me exactly what you really want?

We don't want anything from you.
You know where the problem comes from.
What are you looking at?
I don't think Tom knows where Mari lives.
Three ice creams, please.
Tom's in a pajamas.
I waited for you.
Tom Monkey.
No one lives in this house.

Did you find anything?
Keep this thing away from me.
Why didn't Tom get on the bus?
The dress can be expanded.
It's going to shower 10 times a day.
That's very white.
They left last night.
We've never had a concert in Boston.
Tom may not know why Mary isn't here.
Don't worry.
The handsome people look good, regardless of what they wear.
You compare apples to her circle.
Tom's a desk now.
It's dangerous here.
I can't hold this noise.
I'm so glad to meet you.
Tom doesn't trust anyone.

No, it's not my house.
I live in New York.
We're out of coffee.
Let's have a beer.
What would you do if your child were like that?
My kids don't lie to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
This will never end.
They're both laughing.
I wish you wouldn't do that right now.
I tried to help Tomi.
Your soul is damaged to hell.
I'm a fever and my head hurts, I think I'm going to be sick.
I'm getting ready.
Take this off.
He won his love.
He missed a class.
Can you give me that cup?
In my opinion, Twitter is just a waste of time.
Come on, touch it.
Tom asked Mary the same thing he asked me.
The moon is no one's.
We were born with a reason for this world.
I helped Tomi decorate his Christmas tree.
I forgot to buy flowers for Eve.
We didn't do it for Tom.
He could have kissed me goodbye, but he didn't, he just walked away.

I know who's hurt.
I'm an addict.
By night, the shadow of the tree reached the wall.
He's a good friend.

I have doubts if it will work.
Let's wash it.
He's not there for sports, just like me.
I have a phone.
Tom went back to the hotel.
Do you have a TV?
What should I do with Tom?
I feel better every day.
I feel like a fever.

We're home today.
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
No one was in the room.

Although we have done all we can, we know that we will not win.
He was close to suicide.
That was my finger.
My mother didn't say that.

This will be our secret.
Why are you restless?
I'm sorry, but I didn't fully understand what you said.
Last night, there was a fire near us.
We better go, Tom.
You all probably need a little sleep.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't eat this.
It's only a matter of time to get Tom in trouble again.
I got on the plane.
Are you home?
Clouds are surrounded by the mountain.
That's my problem.
How can I understand you?
He's in the kitchen.
I should have done that with you.
Maybe I don't want to eat the same thing again today.
I suppose Tamás was right.
Here's my membership card.
I'm the only one who got Tamás to help.
Tom stayed outside.
One of the wheels of the bicycle is defected.
I don't usually have lunch with Tama.
It's over, isn't it?
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I'll keep it warm.

Tom seems to enjoy the party.
Why doesn't Tom want to come with us?
What a mess.
How annoying!
Tom packed the boxes on each other next to the wall.

It was like a father to me.
You'll regret it.
There's help on the way.
Are you speaking French in Canada?
I wish I could do it.
Keep listening.
