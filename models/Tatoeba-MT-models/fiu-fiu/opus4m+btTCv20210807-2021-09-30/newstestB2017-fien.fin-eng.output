The 28-year-old cook was found dead in the sanfranciscola shopping centre
Only recently, a 28-year-old cook moved to San Francisco was found dead in the local shopping centre’s stairs this week.
The victim’s brother says he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother.
The body found in Westfield’s shopping centre on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old sanfranciscola Frank Galician, reported in San Francisco’s Medical Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a murder.
The victim’s brother Louis Galicia told ABC’s KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job when he was going to San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant cooking six months ago.
The Sons & Daughters restaurant said death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small and tight team like a family. We're sorry is big," the representative says.
"Our ideas are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia says Frank was living in hostels first, but he had finally got it ordered.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," he told Louis Galic to the KGO station.
Louis Galic says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
“He was a kind and a great heart.
His way of being together with the family was to put food for us all," says Louis Galic.
“He never wanted to have a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the power.
Despite all the misfortune in the world, he was an insane diamond who shines every day,” he says.
All the people who know about the case are asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's clue number 415-575-4444.
Fisting junior doctors require new work fights
The representatives of British junior veterinarians (which are responsible for Finland, mostly specialist doctors) have begun to join their trade union and have requested permission for new work struggles in a dispute on the new employment contract.
The JDC (BMA) junior medical committee (JDC), which represents British doctors, is asking for support from the entire government for additional efforts from the beginning of September.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved the problem of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in the vote held in July.
58% of the voters rejected the agreement.
Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, published a letter sent to JDC members on Thursday evening to Twitter, where he said that the government had “selfly” questions which McCourt said led to the repression of the agreement.
The letter reads: “In this light, the JDC Government has voted completely against the new draft agreement and demands that new formal negotiations be held on all of our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the government of JDC has today submitted a formal request to the Government of the BMA in which it asks for permission for the short-term expanding work operations since the beginning of September."
As a result of the dispute, junior doctors have already been in a strike six times this year, including the first complete postures ever seen in the history of the UK public health system.
Johann Malawana, director of BMA’s junior doctors, resigned after the vote, for he did not accept the negotiated contractual terms recommended by BMA.
Malawana told BMA members at the pre-voting meetings that the agreement was good and should be accepted. The vote was attended by 54,000 junior and medical students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would enter into force and apply to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: the Foreign Alliance?
It was a gesture that decided the crisis.
On Tuesday, Russian and Turkish leaders met with their hands to reconciliation and to finalise the eight-month word war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met his Turkish brother in the golden hall of Peter’s palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties have been armed,
But Putin's smile seemed skinny, and he didn't very much decorate the heat even with his own retention.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin, according to a report, five times.
I didn't keep the bills.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote Erdogan that he was acting as if nothing evil had ever happened.
I understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant vileys from Putin showed that the Russian chief has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the event was rage.
Putin strictly attacked Ankara and accused him of stabbing his back.
The insult was even bigger because it came from a supposed friend.
Recovery of real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the state had a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turkishs were the cause of everything.
The most serious was the accusations of top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, controlled by Ishis.
Erdogan has banned the accusations strongly.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move forward.
In the end, this meeting was only held so that Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
This could bring some victory in Russia.
The benefits of proclaiming a harsh armor are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all potential friends after he was almost removed from power in a failed revolution last month.
He has also been clearly shaken by repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic impact on the agreement.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey strongly, in particular a ban on charter flights, as there are usually millions of Russian tourists travelling to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, travel operators and charter companies will be sure to care for the relief when air traffic can eventually be continued.
They put their faith in the late-song attack on the Mediterranean.
And yet this week, the state television has predicted the price of fruit and vegetables to fall when the importation of Turkish agricultural products is permitted again.
"You traveled there, the tomatoes back here," was formulated in Vedemost's article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is mad at the west because it thinks the West reacts to a coupling attempt.
Unforgettable to forget the old horror of the progressive EU membership negotiations in Turkey and the intervention of Putin in matters. Putin, which is an enthusiastic to take advantage of the cool gaps and to worry about Turkey's ties to the west.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won a bonus score from Ankara when he expressed his support to the elected authorities after the coupling attempt.
This was obvious to Moscow, who had his own concern about the change of power.
As a result, Russia and Turkey could, at their top meeting in the Pramean Sea Trails, convey the picture described by an analytics as a "external alliance": two countries who experience their becoming abandoned and disobedience to the West, combine their forces.
Despite the public agreement, these two still have major disagreements.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peace builder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It is much to say that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not discussed the subject at all.
The President of Turkey refusing to answer the question of divergence in the countries, while Putin emphasised them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek a consensus in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the NATO Member State in shooting down the Russian battle machine, it is undoubtedly better that after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State are still in speech.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the Director-General of the RBS Bank, the bank's operations outside Scotland will be reduced so that it will continue to provide only business services, i.e. back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand initially joined the bank’s global objectives.
The bank had to retreat its objectives when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to save.
During that period, brand-friendly strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scotland customers, but it will not be used to shorten RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, except the head office and the stock market list.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are smaller private banking brands that will gain higher weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during the presentation to customers and staff in Invernesshir.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS becomes a investment brand, and because we are now becoming a bank of different brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced ending the sponsorship of Six Nations and has increased the profile of various brands in sport sponsorship.
“It is now the right time to become a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers,” says the Bank’s Executive Director.
“It would have been very exciting three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank to our customers and have introduced brands.
But the work we do and focus on customer needs, instead of our own needs, has changed a lot.
We can bring these brands back, so I think the time is right.”
Frankie Dettori rided the Predilection to win in Newmarket and won 3,000.
Dettor showers champagne after winning twice in Newmarket, which meant 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured its 3,000 wins in the British Championship series in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone by riding his horse to win the Predilection twice the same night on the track of his own place. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey that reaches this versatile track in competitions running.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson have come to the same time.
The Triple Master Jockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayyar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket because I just got here 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20 000-person audience.
I am relieved and I feel great humiliation.”
Dettori accepts hurricane with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in the aesthetic races, and they are the champion of Richard Johnson and the 20-fold retired master Sir Anthony McCoy, who won a record career over 4,300 times.
Lester Piggott, nine-fold Derby winner, 4 493 wins
“Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it’s not surprisingly surprisingly that he just reached this milestone, which few have reached.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical preference is what separates him from others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm, and his charms have brought supporters to the species for years."
“I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won already 6,000 races, unless he would only compete on weekends and just in big races!
Speaking seriously, Franki's riding career in the UK has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a vibrant person, which is good for the British race, but above all he is an incredible jockey.”
Frankie Dettori ventilated his achievement in a symbolic way by jumping off his horse's back.
Frankie Dettori has been a model for the British race for two decades.
There's a lot of uppers and lowers on the trip.
He has won many major races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived the flight accident and had been in the competition ban due to drug abuse.
When the competition ban ended three years ago, he had trouble starting, but he showed the stunning strength of the character, appeared to his suspects and returned to his best.
And for a while he is not going to end his career – Dettori has recently said that he wants to continue the competition until at least 50 years old.”
Putin fired Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly resigned his head of director Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted insider for many years.
Ivanov, 63, now appointed the Special Representative for the Environment and Transport Affairs.
According to Kremlin's communication, President Putin decided to release Ivanov's duties as Head of Russian Presidential Administration, but no justification for resignation was given.
Anton Vaino has been appointed as Vice-President of Ivanov since 2012.
The persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Justo, born in 1972 in Tallinn, graduated from the Moscow National Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has worked in the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he led the president's protocol department and the government's office, says the Russian-language website of Kreml.
The persecution thanked Putin for his name, saying, “I am grateful for your trust.
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your actions as a Head of State, which means the creation of legislative drafts and the monitoring of the implementation of the guidelines you provide."
Putin said to the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended persecution for his successor.
Are smiles real?
This transfer has caused Moscow a confusion.
Sergei Ivanov has long been part of Vladimir Putin’s neighborhood, and, like Putin, he also has a KGB history.
He was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, both said Ivanov would withdraw from his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations only convince few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are they fired from some sort of power fight?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been highly suspicious of the official argument that a man who has been praised as president suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy.
On the Kremlin website, Ivanov’s words are presented to Putin, in which he says: “It’s true that in the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and somewhat difficult job for four years.
I have now served as president's head for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the State Security Service of KGB.
When Putin was head of the FSB Security Service (FGB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his Deputy Chief.
When Putin came into power, he named Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.
In time, it was thought that Ivanov might come after the second period of Russian President Putin, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin from choosing for the third period.
However, the mission went to another nearby area of Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became the Prime Minister, after which he returned to the president only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds - the FBI researchers - star Thomas Gibson was fired after he was hit by the producer
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute in Los Angeles last month.
The series was produced by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, had filed an apology on Thursday before he was notified of his resignation.
“We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," he says in his announcement.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents, will be published later on the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios newsletter.
Previously in the comedy series, Dharma & Greg played 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in the series since its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul on it for the last twelve years,” Gibson says in the newsletter he published on Friday.
“I was hoping to see you until the end of the series, but it’s no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the authors, producers, actors, our fans and the most important: the best fans that the series could ever have hoped."
The 12th production period begins in the United States on September 28.
The mysterious beaching of fish in the Banffian Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are windfish that have been immersed in the land as a circular storm.
A Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea coast, published a display of photo material in Periscope and hoped to receive an answer to the appearance of these five-century fish.
Queensferry's crossroads are now connected to Fife
The project will now be completed by 1,35 billion by May 2017.
The engineers have attached the Queensferry overroad bridge to the northern cover and land bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four parts between the "citizens' threats" that are now almost ready around the three pillows of the bridge.
The bridge share of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of iron.
The project will now be completed by 1,35 billion by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the country today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says, “This is a historical and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry overroad bridge.
We are all witnessing a very significant progress in building a bridge, with more than 30,000 concretes and steel used to build this bridge.
Despite mass size and weight, the construction of the bridge between the landscape and the bridge cover is a subtle operation requiring extreme accurate installation tolerances.
The entire bridge cover is now around 79% in place, and the end of the cover is getting its concrete penetration in Rosyth today, which means that the cover is ready to be lifted.”
Forth Crossing Bridge Constructionors, Michael Martin, says: “The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant urine stop in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this proportion represents the top of the road and water construction industry.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and attached to the North Tower road cover, then we had to close the remaining northern (i.e. the side of the road).
This was done by pulling from the north to the south of 700 millimetres.
This was a massive and at the same time a major precision operation.
Massive, because the lands have a length of 222 metres and a weight of approximately 6,000 tonnes, and it had to be pulled up at about 3 per cent altitude angle.
And accuracy demanding, because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small – only a few millimetres.
Fortunately everything went well.”
Moelfre Bay's rescue department tells us about the miracle of three men.
As Anglesey, the three men who were caught in the water were saved as a miracle store.
The Moelfre RNLI Maritime Rescue Station alarmed Friday at 13.20 local times when its crew had discovered an accident in the Moelfre Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely while their boat continued their holiless journey without a director.
“We saw the boat wandering right next to them and imagined the worst,” says Vince Jones, who was driving the Moelfre rescue boat.
By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had transported the boat away from them.
The local fishing boat rescued two of the men, while the third, 60 years old, was found exhausted by a boyship and without the savior.
They were all taken to the coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, “It’s a wonder that these three men who have had water are still alive and completely okay.
There was an emergency shuttle on the boat engine, but for some reason, it had been removed from a boat from a timed man.
They were really lucky on their trip."
Pokémon Go Yacht brings health and happiness
It is fascinating to follow how the world changes.
During the last decade, many have complained why teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but they prefer to stay inside to stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get out of the couch and move.
Originally, the time of screening only took a TV view, then also came video games and the latest smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and the foreign movement do not close each other.
This, of course, refers to Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a game app whose characters come from the video game created in the 1990s (which later also made a drawing series, game cards and other accompanying products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, it also slipped a little before the new game became available at the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
Lancering in other countries delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
Only in a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game passed out of Tinder and was almost equal to Twitter.
How does the game work?
Shortly reportedly, players will go out to search for pokémones on their smartphones, followed by GPS. When you find the pokémon, it can be "photographed" (with the phone screenshot) or "colded".
The stunning has squeezed the video game with the younger generation and lifted the backs from the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the "centric person" takes a day.
Washington Post recently told the Apple Watch Intelligence Cardiogram app that found within two days of the game launch that the number of people moving in 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know which users play Pokémon Go game, it only sees the raw data of exercise.
Many public health campaigns in which people are encouraged to get out of the couch and move at least 30 minutes a day have gone to deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have seemed accidental.
However, the importance of exercise should not be reduced.
The probability of regularly moving people to suffer from cancer or depression is lower.
Exercise helps in weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large amount of other benefits.
The finest of the Pokémon Go game is that it can get people out to do something they enjoy.
This will achieve three basic health-promoting issues – exercise, raitis air and sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is possible to even have new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon is one of the depleting cheerleaders.
And yes, someone can walk through the door when playing.
What about it?
The breakthrough is done.
Although smartphone applications like Fitbit could already follow your activity earlier, they did not give the reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty disappears and the use decreases during its time.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémons, more games will be introduced where apps and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the exercise and enhance their fitness and health.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in the multiplayer game of women's crafts.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of them.
Dynamic jumps.
It's incredible.
The rests are shaking on the permano.
Great in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old teline winner won the multiplayer championship on Thursday and grew a difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic Lightball.
His total point 62.198 was clearly better than the team of the "Final Five" team with Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal at Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles will be present in the US in the final Thursday of the individual competition for women in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in Rion 2016, the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
The party became the fourth consecutive and the fifth American woman of all time, who won the championship of the multiplayer, thereby strengthening his reputation as the best or even the best of all times.
Biles squeezed into tears when his total final point came to appear and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the species into completely new dimensions and raises him to the same class of sports with other superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superfluous for the last three years. He has won 15 World Championships, of which 10 gold, and earned them with so ambitious and accurate programs that the Olympic Winner Mary Lou Retton of 1984 called him "the most powerful teline winner of all time".
There was one last competition left in Brazil, especially between Biles and the burden generated by his self and overwhelming expectations, not even between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less coural gold medals would be disappointed.
The United States Simone Biles (in the left) and Aly Raisma hug after winning gold and silver in the final Thursday of the individual competition of women in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on i, coordinated and now retired Martha Karoly's homeworkers.
Although Biles argued that he had never thought of anything before when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
A part of his permanto program, which includes his card-known volttic series, is adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
When his grandparents were adopted and coach Aimee Boorman’s mother found, Boorman found a strong character. Boorman found a girl when he was on a day-care trip in a gym in which Boorman trained.
He has not lost any multiplayer competition since summer 2013, and the winning pipe is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Blackfina got into a small lead in two rounds, it was like fabrication.
There was a boom and a permanto where Biles was a defensive world champion.
He got back to the lead after he got 15.433 points and crowned the end result at 15.933 points.
Raisman gracefully huged him in waiting for the final points — which was just formality — and tears began to appear around Biles’ red, white and blue glittering border color when the dream written in his cut book was fulfilled.
Raisman’s performance was a small revancing for the four-year-old competition, when he first split the third place, but then lost the bronze to the Blackfina with the latest round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, which the Americans call the team "mummy" was clearly above the Blackfina.
He sent air kisses to the public after his permanto program and thus became a winner from the defeat position, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles comes, this 19-year-old tweet is now completely new:
Police say three musices in the car listened to being a victim of a serial killer
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most destructive mass murder for ten years, and the victims were sitting in a car and listening to music when they were shot, says the police release on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on June 12, the car parked in the street was shot by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah.
The shooter was standing on the side of the car, where he shot eight shots with a hand gun and then escaped with another car, the news says.
The police suspect that the cause of the third death was not a robbery, because the attacker did not take the bags and the 2 900 dollars found in the hall of another adult victim.
Police reporter of Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the murder is related to four attacks previously.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks, mostly in Latin America’s settled areas within four months.
“It is common to the attacks that they have been in residential areas in front of homes,” Howard told CBS’s subsidiarity to KPHO in the past this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks relate to each other and that their factor is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital because of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that the three were often sitting in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a newsletter on the empty shooting of an open-package car only half an hour before the third death. In both cases, the shooter is believed to be the same.
Scientists found seals and captured bullet chips from the car seat and engine space.
The mother of a 6-year-old boy with microchephalia: "The things become better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But unlike most of the other age friends, Edmund has microchephal, i.e. a congenital minority, due to his mother Elizabeth Picciuto's genetic disorder that he was not aware of when he was pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I wouldn’t make it.
I can't get through this.
I didn't commit to this.
What is not true – of course you are committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund would never recognize them or perhaps survive at all.
Some of the doctors went so far that he suggested that the child be placed in medical care.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t think there was any more practice,” Picciuto said.
Edmund walks with a roller.
Edmund sat down and began the container only when he was 3 years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he moves slowly to his own pace.
He walks with help and drives a bicycle.
She enjoys playing with her two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth presents a sign of Edmund's invention in which he means "laul to me".
"We teach him a sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean a normal sign language, but it also includes the inventions of Edmund itself.
The background of microkephalia can have a variety of diseases: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or during pregnancy virus infections such as ash or zikavirus.
Oirs and forecasts have a great variation.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people with zikavir.
Picciuto remembers the feeling storm caused by the uncertain future.
“I kept working: what happens to us,
“What happens to us?”
He still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prediction in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has the hope of giving advice to mothers whose children have birth defects caused by zikavir.
“The things become better.
It's usually going to be okay.
“You love your child, and your child loves you.”
Strong rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi States
On Friday, the Governor of Louisiana announced the emergency space due to the harsh roads and widespread floods. More rains are still expected to be in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several Southeast Southeast Southeast Southeast Southeast and Southeast Mississippi rivers flood over their umbrellas and spread to a wide area as a result of strong hardening rays.
Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, says that state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities and that assistance is already on their way to flood areas.
The National Security and Emergency Governor's reporter Mike Steele reports that the Agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandways.
According to Steel, only the county of Tangipahoa has asked for tens of thousands of sands.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most parts of South Lousiana.
According to the information provided by the weather service, water may be added 76-127 mm.
In South Alabama, the flood warning was given on Friday when the rain continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend near the Comite River, near Baton Rouge and Amite River, both in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to the recording heights.
According to the weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses on the rivers may be flooded under the Baton Rouge suburbs.
In addition, he says that flooding at the bottom of the Ascension County constitutes a threat, as the flooding rivers slowly emptied into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River flowing south of the Mississippi border in Louisiana Liverpool on Friday at 9 p.m. was already higher than ever.
The rescue work continued in the Amite and Wilkinson district in the southern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and grandchildren, had been near Glosteria on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek River, which is usually over 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other boy who lived near him had warned him.
"We got up and the water came with a constant feed," Hansford said.
"It touched my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that he had never seen the river rise so high over the 48 years he lived in the region.
Hansford tells us that he and his family members have injuries, and he himself is the only swimming skill of them.
The rescue workers had saved all three large military trucks and taken them to the fire station in Glosteri, where they kept protection on Friday.
The weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly when the hard drives continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells Livingston’s close-minded observer that between midnight and Friday morning it was almost 350 mm.
Krautmann says the soil was soaked strongly after the rains that began on Wednesday.
The authorities say that due to the floods and streets, the inhabitants of Tangipahoa County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be canceled in five school circles.
The member of the City Council of Tangipahoa had told CBS’s subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The residents were evacuated into two churches, but now the flood has triggered both of them.
Robby Miller, director of the county, says that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets who had remained captive to flood.
Evacuateds have opened shelters in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
“They get back to their homes when the water begins to retreat,” he says.
In Hammond, in Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets had to be shut down because of the flood, and the residents were offered sandbaggles to try to prevent water from entering their homes and their businesses.
"The last time we had a great flood in March," said Lacy Landrum.
"This flood looks similar."
In Mississippi, the rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, the rescue director of Harrison County.
Lacy tells us that Thursday was reported of a coural flooded house, but on Friday, no one had ever come to know.
Shopper Value Foods Market Manager Keith Townson says he lived in Amite for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rains all the time."
Multiple bullets in his body who received a 6-year-old Mahaj Brown survives the Philadelphia shooting attack
According to the police, Philadelphia has been shot by a six-year-old boy, who is already another six-year-old, shot in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child said on the CBS Philadelphia channel the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to the grandparents, the boy had several shooting wounds in the nipples, legs, arms and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of hits, his little body was full of bullets," said his son's grandmother Delores Melendez to the TV company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and he has been subjected to several cuts.
The family tells the television company that the boy is supposed to survive.
He was starting his first class at local secondary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
The second 29-year-old state was reported to be critical and the rest of the two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the TV company, the child was found at the front seat of the car at a critical position next to the 29-year-old.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Police researchers told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The event was filled with assault types of shelves, which were derived from various attack weapons.
“It is absolutely clear that it was a ongoing battle.
On the street there were shelves on both sides of the footwall.
There have been several armed fighters, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," said Chief Officer Anthony Ginaldi, Philadelphia.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the region.
No arrests have been made, and according to the police, the police are going through surveillance videos.
The second victim of the shooting in the city this week was a girl who was caught in the hand of a mistrust when he played on Tuesday in front of his home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call the Olympic Team of Women's Military Forces, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been as superpowerful as it is now.
Secondly, three of these teams, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, will make everything proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also confirmed the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female winner has been African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in place 1 and 2.
This is great.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became a surprise winner of the races, and the whole America hurried.
The world has now been able to prove the incredible performances of the threefold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the surprising and mastery workforce programs.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth consecutive American who won gold in the multiplayer of women’s individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman won silver.
These views are at the top of the species, but they do not look the same throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five (Final Five), as the next Olympic team will have only four winners, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality, however, is that teline-option is a expensive sport and the gymnastics practice mainly in private craftsmen euros, which are maintained by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, spaces, travels, outfits, competition fees, hotel fees (coachers, gymnastics and family members), etc.
The premises of most teline-powering euros are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the operation.
Telecommunications teams are taught in these clubs, and it means a costly and long-term commitment to the families of the gymnastics.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both trained the race enthusiastic since they started the craftsmanship.
We need to organise a more affordable and more accessible workforce education for those young girls whose enthusiasm has been raised by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own craftsmanship foundation 20 years ago.
My organizations in Harlem have provided a free or affordable opportunity to engage more than 15 000 urban young people (mostly black and Latin Americans), and some of these young people have attracted national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my home town of Detroit to provide high-quality rolling force for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic race.
Telecommunications develops strength, diligence and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determinedness.
This combination brings sustainable benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has inspired thousands of young girls who now want to start the workout, and it is absolutely awesome.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you for Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madiso’s real "girl power" that you showed when you win the Olympic Gold, and that you motivated so many young girls from their background to start their way to well-being, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers wished to decide on the changes to wages and working conditions by accepting the renewed agreement with the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37,000 junior doctors who participated in the vote, i.e. specialists, rejected the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt told me about the plans to obtain a contract by force and said that the UK public health system (NHS) is "not in any country" and that all additional delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement that contains changes to night and weekend work practices to improve health care during unsocial times.
Mr Ellen McCourt, President of the Committee on Junior Medicine, said last night, “Junior doctors are still very precarious about the proposed agreement, which is a particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so now we have to move forward, because the time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has unwillingly and sometimes responded to the discussion companies.
I saw Jeremy Hunt, despite the fact that last month he promised that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt has to act now, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this is not the case, junior doctors are ready for new work fights."
At the end of April, the previous strike postponed nearly 13,000 routine measures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support strike doctors.
Ministers wished to conclude the dispute on the changes by a renewed agreement with the staff of the UK professional union representing doctors.
The union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS employees, called on junior doctors not to strike new strikes.
Mortimer says: “Working measures achieve very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services already operating at the borders and cause concerns, anxiety and disruptions to patients, care staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have negotiated with the Junior Medical Committee, and, together with the Ministry of Health and the other bodies, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the revealing of inconsistencies.
The employees were hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics – such as development, flexibility of education, additional training, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum programme, educational freedoms and gender pay gap – was a sign of how serious workers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health want to comply with the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May.”
A drug costing about 2.40 € per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients receive approximately 2.40 € per day as the authorities recommended that they be given it to more people and for longer-term use.
The anticoagulant anticoagulant tikagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with cardiovascular disease.
The medicine is given already 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is part of the UK public health system (NHS) and which evaluates the introduction of new treatment methods, has instructed patients to give ticagrelor for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now, NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which evaluates the introduction of new treatment methods in the UK’s public health system (NHS), has instructed patients to give ticagrelor for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people receive a heart attack every year, of which a quarter of which the heart attack recurs or receives stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fatty substance that accumulates in the blood vessels walls that produce plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot breaks, it can pass with the blood circulation and prevent the flow of blood into the brain, resulting in stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is greater in people receiving a heart attack at once.
The British AstraZenecan ticagrelor, sold by the product name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of capsules.
The NICE Guideline today recommends that ticagrelor be given for the next 90 mg for 12 months, after which the dose is reduced to 60 milligrams and aspirin is given twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, who evaluates the introduction of treatment methods (NICE) says: “Although there are effective treatment methods to prevent disease progression and symptoms effectively, up to a quarter of the patients receiving a heart attack receive a new seizure or stroke – often fatal consequences.
Fear of regeneration can very negatively affect the quality of human life.
We have evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation on the temporary use of tikagrelor increases the treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since the information on the effectiveness and safety of tikagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, is limited if it is used for more than three years, the programming does not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period.
Due to the climate of political correction, the election volcano in Muslim regions flourished
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year because of corruption, resulting in a report by the government.
The atmosphere of political correctness led to the close of the eyes from a widely spread election in Muslim communities, reveals today's government report.
The former Minister of the Government, Sir Eric Pickles, strongly criticized the police, electoral observers and the city councils for obstructing their eyes from the election violins, 'cause of the hypersensitivity of ethnism and religion'.
According to the former Minister of Regional Administration and the current power character known as the anti-corruption of Pickles, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to create guard chains outside of the voting positions so that feared voters could have been protected.
He suggests that voters should submit a certificate of identity in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter must only give his name and address.
In addition, the report suggests that fingers be embedded in unsettled music after voting so that no one can vote twice.
More people should be protected, says Sir Eric.
He demands that suppliers be accessed to the documents of the Government Council and the decisions of informal committees and working groups be improved.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral violin, but also to combat fraud and economic interests and the more popular culture in local governments," he said.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report on the East London Tower Hamlet vote scandal.
Last year, the special electoral court ordered that Mayor Lutfur Rahman should separate himself from his duties due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court considered that Rahman “failed the religious emotion of his Muslim community in ivaly” and weakened his critics by accusing them of racism and Islam’s oppression.
Rahman was said to use his campaign as the basis for the religious duty of each Muslim to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were questionable or sincerely given in such a way that a person voted by making a different person.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of the fact that the whole country was found.
He expressed particular concern about the postal election violin, where Muslim community members were told to pressure people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including requesting the identity certificate at the voting venue.
The report states: “There has been evidence that some ethnic minority groups, particularly women and young people, have been forced to vote in accordance with the will of parents, particularly in Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“We were concerned that... the government’s institutions had obstructed their eyes from such an action as “politically correct” to ethnicity and oversensitivity to religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to make the system cool, including banning the handling of postal voting tickets from political activists in order to prevent the "recording" of the votes.
The report at Theresa May also calls for stricter checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and preferential fraud.
Consideration of alternatives in which voters would be required to present an identity certificate before voting.
Sticking fingers into unsettled music after voting, so that no one can vote twice.
Systemic checks to ensure the nationality of voters and the right to vote.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition of postal postal voices and postal letter envelopes from political activists.
The police have the right to create security chains around the voting positions.
Amendments to the law to make it easier to raise scary accusations under the Act of the People Act on the extension of voting rights in 1983.
Prohibition of photography at voting places.
Only to allow English in voting places (except for Wales).
Enhancing the training to ensure that the staff monitors the rule that only one person can go to the ballot box at a time.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and considers it “astonishing” that after the Tower Hamlet case no criminal charges were raised.
"The Court separated Lutfur Rahman and his representative for corruption and numerous illegal practices," he said.
"He was found guilty without any doubt, and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticizes the ineffective "racial checks" of the departments responsible for the electoral lists of the City Council.
"The decision of the court last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a awakening," says Sir Eric.
“Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covered election vile and its banning.”
The similarity of the Olympic cyclist with Duchess Catherine and other double creatures in the Olympics of Rio
The Rio 2016 Olympic fans this week became wild by a French biker from Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose similarity to the Duke of Cambridge is amazing.
But, according to the discussions in social media, this 24-year-old Olympic Representative is not the only athlete who fights the championship with a well-known person.
For the honor of the faculty of the Rio races and of all our display boxes, FEMAIL set up a list of all Olympic representatives whose similarity to Hollywood publics is obvious.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (vas.) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the dual being of Duchess Catherine on bike tracks, many people have noted in social media how one of the swimmers could be the actor favourite Leonardo DiCaprion's twin brother.
The United States Men's Fleet Shooting Team Brady Ellison caused a storm after the pictures published on Twitter, in which he reminds me of the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the situation of social media and admitted that he had heard since his child, he was reminded of DiCaprio.
“I don’t see the same appearance as such, perhaps except beards and fries,” Brady Huffington said to Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In London’s 2012 races, the British long-term jumper was targeted by Greg Rutherford and the popular actress Neil Patrick Harris, which is undoubtedly even more highlighted in these races.
Aliya Mustafina is called the double creature of a Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the other hand, a South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known for the Glee TV series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is a "athletic version" of the Inception actress.
Similarly, a tennis star Rafael Nadal and an actor Josh Hartnett have been quoted for a long time, highlighted by both strong corner hairs and lips.
Swimming silver twinist, Russian Yulia Efimova reminds actress Annalynne McCord, not only because of its beautifully brunetted skin and its blossom hair, while the United States team Nathan Adrian, according to his fans, is "athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two iron women, football star Hope Solo (vas.) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (oik.), remind each other of their faces and eyes.
Not only, this Twitter user was delighted when others saw the equation.
This user wonders if a pair of identities is a good reason.
One twister recently said he was happy when “the other in the internet agrees with Hope Solon and Jennifer Carpenter’s similarity.”
The American football star and the actress of the Dexter series really remind each other of their faces and eyes.
Many have also seen the similarity of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney’s smiles and gold-winning winner Gabby Douglas and Anna return! in the wide smiles of Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic Commander apologizes after saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonalds’ analysis, instead of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan, in women's 4 x 200 metres of free-swimming message, shocked CBC's direct Olympic reporters on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "dead smells" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
The reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to launch his own opinions at the end of the final of the 4 x 200 metres of women's release message.
MacDonald, who was involved in the CBC screening to bring color, was heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he left fast and died like a pig.
"Thank you for that."
China Swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, washing the second part of the message at 1:57.79, and remained 1.61 seconds from Canada Taylor Ruck, making the Canadians swim into China.
Viewers around Canada react quickly after shocking the commentator’s voice and language.
Emmett Macfarlane twittered: "Did the CBC reporter just say that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig?????
"The idiot didn't realize he was still on the shipment."
The final Chinese Ai Yanhan in the 4 x 200 metres of free-switting message was described by the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with rageous comments by Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his resignation.
The twisters did not arrest their words when they heard how irrelevant Byron Macdonald was.
Twittaja Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound racist.
Scott Russel, who quickly hosted the CBC's broadcast, regretted MacDonald's speech: "We apologize for the comment on swimming performance.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
In the end, the CBC had to regret more than 90 times for people who had tweeted as a reply.
Scott Russel, the commentary colleague, had to apologize for MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and glued his apologies to over 90 other tweeters' comments complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly filed a public apology.
“We are sincerely sorry about these statements and that they got to the shipment.
Last night we apologized quickly to our viewers, and we also filed an apology to our followers of social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer performance, not to him personally.
However, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry about his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his apologies in broadcasting and tried to defend his speech by saying that he did not mean it personally.
“I want to apologize for my comment that I made last night after women’s communication,” MacDonald said at the CBC’s Olympic broadcast.
"I went to the shower, not the person.
It’s clear that I didn’t mean anything degrading, and I’m very sorry.”
Primark prevents underwear in the middle of trade-contracting woman shocked customers
Customers didn’t know where to watch a woman stripped off in the middle of Primark to fit the underwear.
He further worsened the situation by assessing how he looked in underwear, took them off his leg and put them back in the shelf.
He continued to twist and eventually tried four underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark chain store at the Folkestone Bouverie Place Shopping Center where a woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put them back in the shelf
At the same time, two children's mother Jenny Davidson told me that after trying to wear underwear, a woman who didn't know how to dress and walk out of the store without buying anything.
He tells me about what happened: “The people weren’t going to believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took the underwear from the shelf, stripped off her own stacks and underwear and dressed them on.
He did not try to do it unconsciously, but did it without any shame.
Everyone stared when he took the underwear he tried out of his leg, and apparently he didn't like them because he put them back in the shelf.
He did it again three times before he finally decided that he didn’t like them, dressed and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about the eyes – and he didn’t think about a person who would eventually buy the underwear he had made.”
Davidson, a 33-year-old in Kent's town, continues: "How disgusting to think that someone takes the underwear that someone else has been using and hasn't washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
“I understand that the trade staff tried to remove these clothing pieces when the woman had left – which is right.
It would be terrible to take new underwear home and notice that someone else has made them without washing them afterwards,” adds Davidson.
Primark’s reporter commented on this by saying: “Primark is aware of the situation that happened on Tuesday 9 August in the Folkestone movement.
All of these products have been removed from sale."
This is how you defend against the armed attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the Grand Master of Krav Maga in New York, Rhon Mizrach, and asked for advice on how to cope with a shooting robber or assault in the near distance.
The video shows how you can defend the attacker according to whether the attacker is approaching you from the front or behind you.
If the attacker approaches backwards, first turn around to see the attacker and get out of the shooting line, Mizrachi says.
Then grab the weapon so that it will be skipped by your elbow and shoulder, and strike the attacker in your face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knees, and when he goes to the pain of the double factor, hit him on the face with a gun with a pipe and retreat by holding the gun directed to him.
Technology is equivalent if the armed attacker approaches the front. You need to move away from the shooting line, grab the gun and turn it so that the attacker can't fire.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and strike the attacker with a fist in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's shot, retreat and keep the gun targeted to the attacker.
Does that sound hard?
Watch the video how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber by giving up your cash – unless you’re the master of Krav Maga.
World Traveler Ian Wright arrows the most dirty places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and his cocomic reflex on a hard trial by licking Europe's most dirty and disgusting places.
Suffolk leader and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove its resistance by arrowing euro banknotes, handchairs in Piccadilly Circus, the train toilet license label and the Russian public phone.
Before arrowing, Wright measured the objects on a luminometer to see himself and show the viewers where their tongue was pushing.
The experiment was carried out in a documentary film by Ian Wright – on the trail of internal power, and its results were surprising.
The idea of arrowing the hydraulic label of the train toilet may be disgusting, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen bar.
On his trip to Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals with the strengthening of good intestine bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he arrowed was nothing more than a malignant mouth.
Ian Wright became famous for his travel program in which he tested his intestine durability by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
No doubt the arrowing of the rinse and toilet rinse of the rinse of railway stations has challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the document: “I’ve been quite careless about my health since my child and put in my mouth all kinds of stuff like soil, worms and curves.”
In the movie, he really showed himself to be taxable.
The border was only received in an incredible general toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units from the sample.
For the purpose of comparison, it should be stated that the number in the newlywed hands is generally below 60.
The border came in the Russian general toilet, where Wright refused to arrow when the luminometri measured the result of 4000 units – in the newly stabbed hands the same figure is less than 60.
Wright adventures together with the Valio in the documentary film Ian Wright – On the trails of internal force, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as in the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: “This is almost the worst smell I have smelled in any toilet.
4000 units, nothing dirtyer than that!
It's so boring that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film by Ian Wright – the Inner Power in cooperation with the Valio.
Wright received a Valio Gefilus containing milk acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good bacteria and resistance of the intestine.
Niko Vuorenmaa says, "We wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at, and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and finally we ended up asking Ia to do it.”
The health of the salt has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them to a broader context instead of just talking about products and tell us about the good and bad bacteria of our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of salt has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information on it in an interesting way.
The movie also tells us about our sense of humor.”
The film directed by Tom Hakala adds to this: “It’s said that I would have lost my respect to Ian if he had licked some of the items we requested, such as the whispering Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Of course, it was easier to lick some of the objects for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape."
In the 2015 survey, 84% of respondents joined the milk acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the stomach and the intestine and 58% said they used at least occasionally products added to milk acid bacteria.
The disruptive family destroyed the town’s owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall
The disruptive family left 50 000 pounds of damage to the town's tenant house after they had been deployed because of the terrorisation of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and his husband Shaun Trebilcock have been dismissed from their apartment in Cornwall in Saltash after complaints against several couples.
When the couple had been removed from the apartment, the representatives of the rental company said the apartment was shocked to be repaired.
In the walls there were shooting holes, the floors were torn off, the garbage was spread to the floors and the walls were graffits.
The couple has now changed, and they are believed to live in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Apartment Office (Cornwall Housing), says he is afraid that the apartment may not be saved anymore.
He says, “This has been a full nightmare for people living here, no one should tolerate this.
There is a lot to consider, as the property is likely to be known as not so pleasant as part of Cornwall.
The family is malicious, just like its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment occasionally. According to the police, the family’s horror was involved in street fights with baseball lands, scaryness of the neighbors, drug use and transmission, as well as hard-sound screaming, arguing and screaming.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease contract, received a non-social behaviour order in June.
There were old waste in several rooms below the house.
The house had previously been sold with drugs, and the floorboards were torn off.
According to the neighbors, the family was fighting on the street and the police were forced to call on a regular basis.
Cornwall’s housing agency was suppressed by a couple of obsessions this week after giving them 11 weeks of extra time to change away voluntarily.
The easy neighbours were thankful for the wedding – they said their life was a earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We have lived in their neighbor for 20 years, and the whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times.”
“This morning we couldn’t sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we haven't been used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they are finally lost.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of Cornwall’s housing agency’s obsessions, says that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years during which the police were regularly invited.
Wash and old toys were thrown on the wild walls of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It’s a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own and his family’s behavior, because the decision is always the last measure the Cornwall housing agency is considering.
This case was very difficult because the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to watch the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community who participated in the work and boldly offered us information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of the neighbours and send a message that non-social behaviour is not accepted."
Fitzpatrick says that three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment in different times, but they were already in twenty.
A dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms in the house after the extinguishment
The residents must now clean off the waste bags surrounding the house.
The police made a raid in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis and in addition to scales and other supplies and 1,700 £ of cash.
Skeldon was fined when he was found guilty of the possession of Class B drug to sell it.
He claimed the money was in a car accident in 2013 for his son Lee Skeldon's gravestone.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been heard of moving into a private home in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were shattered with graffites.
The police say they're demanding a decision for tenants who violate the rules of rental contracts.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall's police say this wedding is a clear warning to the tenants who are constantly undermined by the rules.
“This is a clear message for those who think they can behave in how they want without accusations, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior,” Crow says.
Devon and Cornwall’s police will never accept criminal and unsocial behavior, and will continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
Lowly flyed, beached by the military shower frightened tourists in Portugal
Solar worshipers experienced a shock in Aveiro, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion airplane of the Portuguese Air Forces crashed at a very low level.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows a moment when tourists got out of control when the low-flyed shower crashed over the entire beach.
The dramatic images show how the military aircraft comes to the near reach of the sand coast of the sun from the tourists taking the sun in the North Portugal Aveira.
Holidayers got up on their feet when they worryed about the steam of the engines of a shower that began to belong before they saw what was going through the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the pictures and videos of the dramatic flight in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, “It passed the beach twice at a very low level, and it was a moment when it looked like it was falling into the ground.”
"I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the Aveiro beach were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew in a very low way.
The Portuguese Air Forces today announced that the pilot of P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, and therefore the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires has deteriorated the visibility, but according to the air forces, this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of Continental-Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today announced that due to the poor visibility of the sanka sum and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight with which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Extracting the result of the first half of the year better than expected
The Social and Health Circle of South Karelia (Eksote) made a better result of 3.4 million euros planned in June.
The exote result was EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where preventive services have been deployed by the development of institutional care.
The treatment warranty was implemented in all activities.
Exote is trying to shorten the lines of action this year.
Exote covers the surplus of the previously born deficit.
The excess proportion may be used to shorten the lines and buy measures for patients.
The result of the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The exoten government will discuss the half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Limits Vanished Military Light in Immola
The 70 guardians of the Border and Sea Guard school swore the military light on Friday.
The Military Valley of the Border and Maritime Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The tenth special limiting course jury was held at the sports field of the Army.
The soldier was sworn to 70 guardians.
Special frontiers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were asked for a special limit.
They were invited to 250.
Special limits have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces were involved in a veteran meeting in the event of the Vala event.
The average age of those with him is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A range of robsvos above - criminal intelligence helps detect crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police departments in Finland has been operating from the beginning of 2014 by the RTA, which is a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outwards.
The Hämeen Police Department includes four police officers in Lahd and Hämeenlinna.
It is pulled by Sergeant, placed in the gift.
He's an executive officer in Inspector Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit is a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian suits.
The unit has demonstrated its eligibility and necessity, considers the deputy police chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various investigations for the other police.
In the wedding, it has acquired information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the latest working methods
Establishing analytical units is the latest reform of police working practices.
The goal was to prevent crimes, i.e. the fact that the police would get more and less pounds in the place until they get an alarm.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where the most needed.
In addition to the reform of the police government, one criminal intelligence centre was established, less than three national units and their own criminal intelligence unit were established in each police department.
The PTR centre in the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa manages operations nationally.
PTR units work in accordance with their name from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, on their behalf, work in areas shared by the police departments and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
The intelligence extends beyond its own territory.
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12 hours of work, the RTA unit’s task is to know what’s going on in the whole area of the police department.
The intelligence also extends beyond the limits of its own institution, as crime does.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than basic police.
The unit aims to draw attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar offences by means of registers, alert databases and observations.
This is called sequestration, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own ways to act.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it was honest or criminal.
Based on the method of doing, the factor consists of a certain image.
The setup may be carried out either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
It is not said of its own and criminal methods because it could lead to the development of professional criminals and thus attempting to prevent police offences.
The procedure is publicly reported if it expects them to threaten.
For example, such a case was reported from the early summer, the way of signing empty apartments used in housing breaks.
The authors put the apartment in the outside door with a stick, a button needle or a tape that they tried to see whether the residents were really travelling.
The pre-examination material is public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest will order a protocol on the right of the court, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found on the spot.
Next time, the gloves go to the thieves.
For the purpose of the case, the deputy police chief Tero Seppä from Hämee, Officer Tuomo Lepolaa from the Eastern Finland Police, Officer Sami Joutjärve from Joensuu Police Station and inspector Arto Tuomelaa from the Central Crimea Police.
The police will collect and analyse information to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last amendment was a three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
The national cooperation collects information from the outside of its own institution and Finland's borders.
A London Schoolgirl related to fathers was killed in Syria
The news tells us that one of the three British schoolers who joined the Iss last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian air strike in Raqqa, the base of Isis in Syria, said ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and according to his family, planning to flee from the country of war and return to Britain.
“It can only be hoped that this will work as a warning example and a will to enable people to understand this is a real risk when they go to the war zone - and who will make people quit the decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other Eastern Schoolgirls, rose to a plane flying to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had been married to the Isis fighter in Syria and remained widow only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected.
Senate's Democratic Director Harry Reid says he is convinced that Hillary Clinton, President of Democrats, will be appointed to the Supreme Court of Merrick Garland if he is elected president.
The Republican representatives of the Senate have not agreed to confirm the name of Garland since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate's majority director Mitch McConnell, the next president is elected to a person to meet the position of the Supreme Court judge Antonin Scala.
Reid said in the Thursday phone talk that he predicts Clinton to choose Garland with great certainty.
The Reid reporter later explained that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton, whether it was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "boat the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the Court of Appeal of the United States in the District of Columbia.
Reid says that the Republicans that prevent Garland's name are presidential candidate Donald Trump's "touchers" and "representers".
Trump says Trump doesn't fit for office.
According to the Treats magazine, naked calendars belong to women as well as men.
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and brings on the market the 1970s style of the Pirell inspiring calendar for 2017.
Instead of public secret models, they want to find the top models of their 2017 NU Muses calendar of the next generation.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats, said earlier this year that his naked newspaper differs from the old school Playboy magazine, as he said, "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this to women."
He seems to think of the calendar as well.
“We have to bring back an untimely and classical nakedness wherever women, wherever men, can uncomfortably enjoy these pictures of the female body and inspire them,” says Shaw in the press release.
“Women will certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art.”
For models, they want to send their images through the network or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: Who Buys Discs?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write a comment on your hateful objection with the name of the Nova AllEveryoneEasternMiehet, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the YouGov research company, there is not a millennial generation boom behind the new coming of much spoken vinyl plates, while millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead there is nostalgic in the middle age.
The age of a person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
The age group 18-24 is actually the least likely buyers.
Also, this is not just the desire of the enthusiastic discs, but the importance of emotion-based: older vinyl plates buyers are a little more likely to hide their feelings (56% v. 53%) and enjoy their loneliness (69% v. 66%).
But do YouGov’s results be true?
If this blog had been broadcast on the news broadcast, the camera would follow me when I walked through the walk of Soho Street, on me with a jewelryless grey jacket dress. I'd rather bet my hands as a cup and say something about traditions, like, "Let's find out."
Let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charming power and rososity, when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before private entrepreneurs owned the premises, there are still plenty of special disc stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I look very close to men visiting these stores and try to evaluate their age and nature.
Glasgowlainen Stuart, 55, followed by the Sister Ray movement (as customers at that time, two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (as customers at the moment eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip to London during the afternoon and spends extra time by exploring shops.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"I think I'm," he says.
"I have about 3000 to 4000 records."
These records fill his living room walls, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me a picture by email, I didn’t follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his available income. He now has the ability to buy records that he couldn’t afford when they first appeared, and to buy again things he had to sell when he was young and without money.
“I have a lot of the early 60s and early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them,” he said.
He agrees that buying vinyl plates is more likely to be introverts that enjoy themselves, and adds: “I don’t burn, and I don’t drink much.
It's my evil."
Wez, 25 in the Sister Ray movement, believes that many of their customers are suitable for YouGov profiles.
However, he has discovered a new type of human flow that media hypnotisation has affected. These people have heard of the coming of vinyl plates and now feel obsessed to buy back their old records.
According to the discussions that I had conducted, people had usually renounced their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This can explain the vinyl-resistant bum of certain ages.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the audio discs?
In just a few seconds, Phonica’s kind of movement realizes that they offer a comforting community to similar types of people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have become injured in particular by contacting the payment system.
The digital world may alarm some of the vinyl fans for whom returning to familiar record boxes means permanentity and reminding you of the happy days of youth.
“I think that it sometimes fills a hole or material property for some kind of comfort,” says Wez.
“I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe that so many others.
It’s an easy way to get thoughts away.”
“We’re like social workers!” spoils Wez’s partner behind the disc.
In April, the ICM Consumption Survey revealed that nearly 50% of those who purchased the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to their records.
The opinion study also reported that 41% of the record player they never use, and 7% of the buyers of the vinyl plate have no own recording.
At this point, I would probably look a serious face while I was like a pink bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl plates also relates to the "pocal phenomenon", the sound of the Universe (as customers at the moment three middle-aged men), Jonny, 42, has discovered.
"A special customer recently came into circulation and said he didn't have a recording player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead disc so he can put it in a shelf," Jonny says.
"These customers are not large, but they are.
Materialism is more important to them than music.
Some of our customers say they still don't have a recording player.
They are younger, not parents, largely teenagers who are just starting a hobby."
The customer is much more varied in Fop, where I come to next. The business has owned a whole layer for vinyl plates.
Customers include seventy couples, photography tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The differences of customers will be delighted, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous movements: the speakers will be blown in the jazz instead of Wild Beasts’ newest sexy synthetic poop.
None of the clients look very lonely, but it is difficult to find a crawling psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes and watching various disks undercutting.
He's watching more than making shopping.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They pay a lot.
Music is easy to listen to from the computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the vineyard is ...", he lets a lovely whisper and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a trade that is said to have inspired the new vinyl fans generation: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who think they're jumping on jeans, but they're instead gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a while, and I see a father and daughter who's thinking about buying Crosley CD player.
On the left there is a staircase filled with Adelen, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac records: a mix of modern music and classics, key records for any medium collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they're just a decorative element and a part so high that they don't even reach them.
They're pure "art vinyl".
However, given that all the means to get attention to these records may include more money in the field and send a few customers to hakuretke to Sohoo, there is little reason to complain.
There is no surprise that the population group, which is most likely to have more time and money than most, is also the group that uses the most money for luxury, such as vinyl plates.
Although the results of my research are correct, at least in Soho’s disc stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both disc stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be close to school or work.
At least they won’t spend Thursday mornings in the Berwick Street record stores, browse records, and avoiding a 30-year-old television broadcaster who stares frighteningly and flashes unprecedented middle-aged men.
Holker, i.e. ice shark, is the longest living spinal – video report
According to researchers, the longest living spinal cord on Earth is ice shark.
According to researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was received for the age of 272 to 512 years in the study.
The French Court rejected the application for the deletion of jungle camp stores
The French Court has rejected the application of Calais's authorities in which they demand the deletion of ten temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camps of thousands of refugees.
Calais’s authorities presented in this week’s legal proceedings claims that the state should have the right to break up 72 temporary trades established for the refugee camp. Trades sell different goods from tobacco to energy drinks and offer haircuts. The temporary restaurants can buy tea by 50 cents or basic meals by a few euros.
According to Calais's practitioner authorities, these shops and restaurants need to be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and because they are associated with fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the Court that trades and restaurants are essential for camps, because the free meals offered by the state-supported organization and other bodies are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often offer protection and free food for those who need them.
The Court of Justice decided that there was no legal ground for executing 72 temporary traders, but considered Calais's prefektium's concerns as "exceptive".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, camp’s food shops, cafés and restaurants, there is much greater importance than just providing food for people who “rest in extremely unstable conditions”.
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the locations under the landfill was the camp Jungle Book Kids coffee shop, which is unwindable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours and asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied minors who are the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed a address in which children’s café is required to be preserved.
According to the letter sent to Guardian, it would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.
Two charity organisations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after the sharp increase in the number of arrivals in summer, the population of the jungle camp has risen to more than 9 000 lives.
The price of food in Finland is much faster than the average in the EU.
Food is cheap in Finland for the pleasure of consumers and the problems of producers.
The price of food has fallen by almost 5% in Finland in three years, when its price fell by 0.9% in the EU countries on average.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
During the last three years, the price of food has decreased to the second largest in Finland from the EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
Compared to the UK only, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information is published in the Ilkka Journalic article, Director of the Statistics Centre’s Development Centre, published in the Information & Trendit blog.
The newspaper compared real prices, i.e. prices, which are proportionate to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food increased dramatically.
In 2013, prices were close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” says Lehtinen.
Then the turn followed, after which the food has become cheaper for a year.
Now, the bans on imports of food imposed by Russia, which have blocked food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the producer prices of agriculture have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in short terms,” says Lehtinen.
The rising price competition in industry and trade has also affected the price decrease.
The large trade chains S-group and Kesko both have lowered their prices.
The price competition for the consumer has been shown as a major advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not an affordable diet, even though the price of food has fallen a lot.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU countries with a similar salary level in Finland.
According to the newsletter, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on VAT.
He found that if the comparative countries had the same VAT rate, they would be sold to third of the cheapest food from the same countries in Finland.
The newspaper compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparative countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finnishs.
"If we want to get to the level of food at the price of the old EU countries, VAT must be pooled to the average level of the EU countries and continue to compete with the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Journalist notes that the calculations made by him at the rate of VAT are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
A returning to the school seat may notice that change has occurred in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
It is a guide to work in all schools in Finland.
Schools decide about the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of a beautiful writing is abandoned, and instead, schools begin to practice coding.
The Swedish teaching begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and the social guides will begin to be read in four.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
It was thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
In this way, they try to make school visits more interesting.
The longest spine in the world was found - ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) is known for ice creams only at the age of 150.
It can still live for 250 years afterwards, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest spine in the world.
In the animal, only an Islamic womb, the oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Women stretch dogs longer, they can grow up to 5 metres.
Since the growth rate is slow, according to the clubs, only about a centimeter a year, adults have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleague at the University of Copenhagen found out.
He determined all the ice sharks of adults from 28 nails that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed from the radio-carbon drive of eye lenses.
The average age of studied sharks was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 cents of amateurs, appeared about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice creams reach genealogy only in more than four metres, researchers decreased that they were about 150 years old at the time.
The research was published by Science.
Stockmann is fired to nearly 300 - the sellers are not reduced
Nearly 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
The cooperative companies in the company with difficulties ended at the beginning of August.
As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs are reduced, most of which are executed as dismissals, Stockmann says in its communication.
According to it, the number of sellers of goods is not reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, around 80 support activities are offered as a seller.
Stockman’s yt negotiations were about 3,000 employees.
At the beginning, the need for reduction was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims at approximately EUR 20 million annual cost savings, which are to be realised over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve the savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in getting profitable from the store.
Although the company’s corrected business result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the trade in goods continues to lose.
Stockmann vs. CEO Lauri Veijalainen said that sales in the commodities have not attracted the company’s objectives.
“People reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive results of Stockmann Retail in 2018,” says Veijalainen.
The second quarter result improvement was based especially on the wardrobe chain of Lindex’s good success.
Ketju achieved its second quarter of all time’s best turnover and results.
The operating profit of the Lindex increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
During the corresponding period last year, the whole Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales will decrease last year.
The corrected business results are expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the most rainy in the north - temperature below 20 degrees in the whole country
The low pressure centre on the north of Finland will keep the weather on a rainy Friday, says the meteorologist Ilona Láng of HS.
In the middle of the country, there are rainfalls, but the southern is the bubble.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country’s mercury remains below 20 degrees.
In the northern rain regions, 10 to 15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team shakes the dopingscandal - a strange explanation for the temperament of the coach
Kenyan general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah appeared as an athlete of the country team in the doping test.
The news agency told me that an athlete in which Anzrah tried to appear is 800 metres of star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan Earth Team, told me that Anzrah's identity was revealed after she had given a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials appeared to the authorities of Anzrah.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home, 'cause he committed his crimes against Kenya's country team.
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use," said Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, to Reuters, the news agency.
The general Olympic sport begins on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run immediately at the time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Last year, Rotich was ranked in the MM races on the way to the fourth, and there are pre-Rio winner favourites.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya’s general sports team claimed that Anzrah went to an athlete accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When the antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was tested.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he was afraid to reveal," the source told.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s general sports stadium rubberizes its emptyness
Where is everybody?
At least, the Rio Olympic Stadium is not following general sports.
On Friday, Rio began a struggle for general sports medals, but the world’s top individuals were able to introduce their skills to a confusing to an empty viewer.
On Friday, Rion’s organizers said that only 58% of the first day’s morning race tickets and 65% of the evening’s tickets have been sold.
Four years ago, the second was in London, where the stadium was pulled out of the hurricane people.
Final tickets have already been sold in Rio.
The Rio Olympic viewer has already attracted attention before general athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the sights of rugby, noise and riding.
When the Brazilian medal drives in Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach balloon in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of them were filled.
After the two of Brazilians, Holland played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12 000 were still full of people.
At least the bad way to go is explained by the fact that Brazil is far from European and Asian racers in economic difficulties, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazil football team did not get full of football stadium.
Mario Andrada, the informant of the competitors, said at the weekend that 82% of tickets were sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends for sale," Andrada said Reuters.
8.5 million tickets were sold in London, although the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over 1,000 euros.
More than half of the tickets pay less than 16 euros.
In the Olympics of London, volunteer workers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio, because the organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
However, the organisers in Rio have provided 240,000 tickets to schoolers in the country for less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
Rion's stadium had enough empty places in the morning.
Even the beach ball Copacaban sand has not been interested in the public.
Jukka Central Hall competed in London 2012.
People with journals were enough.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in the conservation of nature by new means.
The foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant areas of nature.
After that, private, companies and entities can redeem the rights of holders in the country.
The foundation has acquired its first land from Lapland.
The land area has been virtually divided into blocks that can be acquired by the applicant against payment.
The holder shall receive a veto right in its 187 squares block, which means in practice that no approval is required from each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for more blocks.
Acquiring the right to administration is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or gift.
There is no need to leave to carry banderolles or chain themselves somewhere to protect nature,” explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to control his company.
The acquirer of the administrative right receives accurate location information from his block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
On the website of the Foundation, the names of the holders of rights are compiled on the same map where the block data of the land are found.
The spread fabric is considered to be the risk of its natural protection acquisition only to change the operation of the foundation from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a general benefit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation will act in some way unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The main idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is the protection of nature areas so that they can be in touch and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land areas either by buying or donating.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has acquired its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside the borders of Finland and plans to purchase land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest on 13-19 August at the Helsinki Chamber of Commerce.
Bicycle thieves tortured by large cities the worst of Turku - see the situation in your homeland
Bicycle thieves torture the largest cities in Finland, the worst of Turku.
This year, more rounds have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
The Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police on the basis of the bicycles reported to be stolen by the ten largest cities in this year's January-August, and their parts per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were at the top.
According to the police, there were four to five bicycles per thousand people.
In Espoo and Kouvola, only two bicycles were reported per thousand people.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, the population is proportionate to double the number of thefts compared to others," characterizes the police officer Tommi Reen.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The generality of security can be influenced by how much the city moves on wheels and how many wheels are on top of it," thinks Sergeant Temu Äkäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, thinks that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu are looking forward to getting to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycles is largely gone according to which are study and cycling cities.
There is a tight center in the market, short distances and a lot of spins available for thefts.
"For example, Espoo is a very different kind of city where city centers are distant and bicycle is not necessarily a priority tool for moving," Reen says.
In January-August, there has been a little less bicycle stolen than in the last year.
There is still no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police will be aware of a little more than 20,000 bicycles each year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 wheels a year.
"They're big," Reen says.
In fact, the thieves take more wheels, because only some of the victims inform the police of theft.
Reen urges people to make a criminal report on bicycle robbery, even though fewer than every 10 cases reported to the police will be resolved.
Typical uncovered bike robbery is one where the police will get information about theft immediately and the thief will be caught in blood.
“The incidents will also be discovered in the context of other investigations when, for example, a drug case in the apartment can find stolen wheels,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, cyclists will be caught each week in the course of their work or police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
He said that wheels are stolen, for example, from bicycles, interiors, stocks and bicycles, i.e. from everywhere where they are usually stored.
The most individual bicycle models are stolen in the past years like Jops.
The U lock gives the wheel a better protection than many other types of locks.
Some of thefts take the bike, for example, for their short-term use, but most of the stolen wheels end up selling, for example, via the net.
They stay on the domestic market.
“Of course, the police have not found out that the stolen wheels would go abroad,” Reen said.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful because he may be guilty of hiding crime or violation.
"The alarm bells should be ringed if the wheels are sold on their clear bottom," Reen says.
The special library official Severi Hirvi will always carry the colorful Nops for his working day to protect the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He had five pieces of bikes, but none stolen, Hirvi says. "I've never been taken, there's been a good monk."
“Even if this isn’t so attractive to the thieves, there may not be any hipster value here,” the Greek Monster wonders.
In a Kiosk located in the Helsinki Kallio, Transi Valve locked his bicycle in a small U-lock.
Now the bike hit the kiosk against the wall, but generally Valve locks his bike in a solid, like a bike.
"It comes to think about it a lot, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," the helsinki student says of his white bike, whose body alone cost about 500 euros.
"They all the time hear from friends that the wheels have been taken."
Mostly bad spins, such brutal guys.
A bike was stolen from the inside of the house company a year ago.
However, the wheel had been unlocked, so Valve was expecting it to be trapped.
Under the age of 15 are responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with the U.S. peer councils
In Helsinki, the so-called peer council is trying to prevent young people from entering a criminal round.
At first, the trial is applied to persons under the age of 15 who are now under criminal liability.
The jury lacks a crime committed by the first young.
The idea is that the jury discusses the incident with the offender and imposes sanctions.
A week later, the offender may join the peer panel to reimburse his actions.
For example, other consequences can be a letter written to the family, explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
The Youth Executive Director, Tommi Laitio, says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used parallelly.
“All of them are guided in a more responsible direction so that everything does not go wrong with the first mistake,” says Laitio.
There is a model from the United States where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, a young person is not going ahead of the adult panel, but reflexing the events with about the same-aged people.
The model has been tested once.
Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio, following the experiment, tells us that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first offences of people under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with before.
“It has been a message that continues on the path you choose,” Lovio says.
The Comparative Election Team is part of the Helsinki Immigrant Youth Project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new ways of action are offered to all those who need, not just immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding the Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding the Donald Trump presidential campaign.
From the letter, the American newspaper Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is directed to the President of the National Committee of the Republicans, Reince Priebus.
Signatures want the party's money to be directed to the Congress Halls instead of Trump's campaign.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disobedience, incompetence and record discomfort, threaten to bring democrats to the vote,” says Politicon.
Only the direct direction of all possible funds to the Congress Halls can prevent Republicans from drowning a Trump decorative anchor in their neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential elections will decrease every day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent next week.
Among the signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizational persons of the letter is apparently the Republican Andrew Weinstein against Trump.
According to Politicon, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "the people who want the party to protect their majority in the Congress" and that it is not the support of anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump's actions, which are believed to have insulted millions of voters.
He was also said to show dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Previously, 50 officials working with national security this week announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises to facilitate the family of children in the United States
In the United States, Presidential Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton told the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president to make the US economy go well for everyone.
“Donald Trump aims to be president to make the economy go well for him and his friends,” Clinton said.
The Clinton plan has a massive, $275 billion five-year programme to improve the U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by rich tax increases, in part through private money.
The construction program is a hand-resistant for American dunars who suffer from the transfer of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder, we have to go back to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of children’s families working.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to be taxable, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he has previously supported.
"I am opposed to all trade agreements against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before the Clinton speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday, that it “wanted only millionaires like this”.
Trump's suggested reduction in corporate taxes, Clinton has previously appointed "Trumpin's pork holes".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the listeners of small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump has not paid, and the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start making products in America,” Clinton blew.
Such are Rio's viewers: Kisat has not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interested in
Usually, sports races are seen in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain tips.
To date, the Olympics of Rio have not reached a huge number of viewers.
At the same time, the races have glued to the grids at the top of the 12% of the population: Tuesday night’s swim followed by 615,000 audiences from Yle’s Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
Due to the comparison: the EMs of a month ago received nearly 800,000 audiences at the end of TV2, and the EMs of football were fairly another million.
The most interested in the Olympics so far has been cycling on Sunday evening and opening the fifth race day, both reaching almost half a million viewers at the same time on the Olympic channel.
The top sports manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the viewers, and reminds us that the viewers will first share in the Rio Olympics in several different instruments.
In addition to television, the Finnishs follow the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV watches are mostly choosing the Olympics.
On the side of the television, viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports races to which Yle owned the entire channel.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London races or in the 2008 Beijing races, but the difference is explained by the difference in time - a large part of Rio's races will be in Finland during the nighttime.
Another reason for dizzy interest - if someone now keeps it dirty - is definitely a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early races, interest would have gone up with it.
In addition, general sports is just beginning, as are other Finnish-interesting species: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkise, the original viewers were close to the expected number.
When general sport begins, the audiences explode.
Yle lanseered a Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for races, which rose on the first days of the races in the Apple App Store for the most downloaded free app in Finland.
By Monday, the application was downloaded 150 000 times.
I guess we're going on the way to 200,000 downloads.
"We only get the blood's viewers later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked with all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been linked with delays and other small technical problems in the early stage.
Applications have received updated versions that should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are more visible in the Yle channels and arena than any other sports event ever before.
From the Yle Fem channel, you can track some species, and on the radio, Yle Puhe conveys races every day.
Olympians are not only working animals for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed by the Yle channels.
Since 2018, the Olympic Sports will be seen on both top and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Sun, the depth of which is 95.3 metres on the Crossbow.
It might be deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical suburbs trainer, found about 20 square meters of the crossbound printing, with the depth of the diving computer appeared to be 104 metres.
During the summer 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre tried to inevitably confirm the observations by shining.
The method does not necessarily find a small deepening in 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth remains 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
More than 80 metres are located in Saimaa, Secondary Water and Headquarters.
They have not been studied as accurately as the Sunnetta.
In particular, the bottom of the Lake Inari has not been carefully maped.
“There could be some unknown depths,” Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by the medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 metres.
In view of this, your Sun will not be able to reach the ten deepest crowd, and Suvasvesi is still farther from the top.
Correction 12 August at 14.29: Corrected last song, where the deepest lakes of the middle depth were wrong.
Individual tax: Retirement tax continues to be tighter
Retirement tax is still tighter than wagers.
A person says that an inconsistent occurred under the parliamentary elections, and the tax of pensioners was promised to be equal in relation to the employees.
The government's proposal does not include this.
We think that should definitely be there.
Promises given should be followed after the elections, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wagers received reduced income reductions that reduced tax.
The case was heated by representatives of the opposition in the Parliament, which drove off the electoral promises of the Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (kok.).
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
In the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpon (kok.), tax reductions are mainly about the protection and increase of purchasing power, since next year wages will not be increased.
He says that tax cuts have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase the uncertainty of people.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk.) and Orpo’s messages for the desire to respect the competitive agreement reached with difficulty.
He says that maintaining the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by labour market organisations, so it should not be questioned.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much for domestic demand and people’s own future faith.
Long-term Unemployment Disruptive
A person urges the government to address the long-term unemployment in the budget gap, at least to stop its growth.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than a year earlier.
He says that unless the growth stops, the government’s goal of increasing employment to 72% is to run away.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there is a huge social decline in the promise.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
Last night and last night, at least four people were killed in the bombing attacks in Thailand.
The Embassy calls on Finnish citizens to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the guidance of the authorities.
There is no reason to cancel the trip to Thailand for explosions, but the instructions of the Embassy should be followed with caution, Westphalen says.
In Thailand very little Finns
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to assess.
The Finnish Thai travel period is scheduled for the year-to-year shift.
Most Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from the Finns in Thailand via Facebook after bombing.
The Embassy has tried to aim, in particular, to find out about the situation of the city in Hua Hin.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, there is no evidence of the attack.
The Ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political restoration of the shared Thai society and the last week's referendum on the constitution prepared by the Military Jun.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open democratic process.
People were arrested in the country, among other things, who announced to oppose the law.
In the southern provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict in Muslim populations, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their right of self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Bangkok is today a great, local holiday, Westphalen says.
He said the city celebrates the birthday of the queen and the Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very small.
The attacks affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very accurate for safety.
Thai Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from ordinary terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also closed, according to AP, the Thai police report.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the popular Phuket and Hua Hin of tourists.
Even in the popular tourist destination of Finnishs, the holiday island Phuketilla exploded four bombs at night, says Bangkok Post.
According to the current data, they did not require death sacrifices.
Two bombs exploded at Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
In Hua Hin, the popular tourist destination, according to local authorities, has exploded four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one of the two bombs died.
In South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in both towns of Surat Than and Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many travelers, as it is carried by Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
Factor of attacks not known
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military train in Thailand, said that the attacks were not yet known.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We do not have to panic people more, he said to journalists.
According to Vice-President Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the factors had been intended to destroy the country’s tourism, because all the attacks have occurred in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland calls on Finnish citizens to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns planning to cancel their journey due to explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the great-minded explosion, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
The attacks and their victims during the night of Finland are very little known for the time being.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has been time to get a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At Hua Hin's last attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded in the sights of a well-known clock tower.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin, where it believes they have found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower seat, according to the governor of the county.
In the attack, the municipal worker died.
There are at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN tells us that the Surat Than attack also used two bombs exploding around half an hour.
Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The United States Party won the Fourth Game of Women
The United States Alexandra Raisman was the second at 60.0998 and the Russian Alija Mustafina was the third at 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for a bargain championship in Rio's races with a permano, jump and boom.
Biles has controlled women's gymnastics in mind for the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships since the last three years.
He has won the Fourth Championships and Championships three times consecutively, both in the last and second year.
In the United States team, Biles has achieved two World Championships.
Biles has a jump and a boom.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism in Phuket of Thailand and the play club of children in the same property.
If there are no more attacks, then I don’t think this will be any more amazing, it will be estimated as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
Experienced entrepreneurs have seen close to many of Thai tragedies.
There's always something here.
At first there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb in Bangkok.
If these former tourists have not been expelled, this is hardly even.
The Huovila company office is located a few hundred meters away from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about nine local times and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were placed because of the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many had not even heard of attacks on the beach.
Half three times a day in Thailand in Patong, the traffic had been normalized and most of the stores had opened their doors.
According to the explosion site, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila at the attack site.
Later, this car was seen at the Kruunupyy in Jouxholminte.
When the police arrived, the car was fired.
The patrol found two men who were suitable for the sense marks, hiding in a close six.
Another man was immediately captured.
The other escaped, but later the man was found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage of the motor vehicle.
The police thank the people who gave the tips.
Research Director of Russia's Leadership Changes: Clear Displacement
On Friday, the most valuable change in leadership was made in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin dismissed his head, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is a 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-graduate and acted as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from collecting too much power around him.
He added that the recycling of leadership tasks is one way of power.
This is the way to prevent people from gathering independent power for themselves.
According to the fabric, it is also possible that Ivanov has been struggling with other executives or screwed up.
Ivanoville
Ivanov, who belongs to Putin’s interior, is moving to specific environmental and transport tasks.
Putin said it was a common decision on the tape presented by the state media.
Putin said Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed persecution to be replaced, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from the Ivanov point of view it is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia in order of importance.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin in KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old map, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
The older researcher from Katri Pynnisniemi, the Foreign Policy Institute, says that it is more interesting than the successor of Ivanov’s place is that Putin switches his neighborhood to the younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as human shields when they retired in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to Jarabulus to prevent us from targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Military Council of Manbij.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to the Iss.
However, it is estimated that tens of jihadists remained in the city.
Earlier at 19:30 a.m., we mistakenly told the civilians that they were fleeing from the city, actually the Isis fighters kidnapped the civilians when they escaped from the city.
Professor: The Publicity Line of the Ministry of the Interior is illegal
The policy of the Ministry of Interior of Public Documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutian says to the STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the authority's own lines, but it is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to release the list of participants in the events of the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The minister justified the decision by the guidance of the State Council’s Office and the fact that the information was entered in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The minister’s communications director tells the STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
The Last Olympic Show in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt has run against time.
He insulted his backwards from the early season and had to skip the Jamaica Olympics.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am much better.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
The press conference included small-shaped sambatants and fans.
Porina Bolt around is underlined that the Jamaican star has risen during the time when general athlete has been competing with the dopingscandals and a splendid interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat in the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he retarded 200 metres in the beginning of time 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down your injuries and loose training position.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred metres in which he crushed the world record and the final celebration of the competitors’ self-confidence.
This is harder.
A year later, at the Berlin MM competition, Bolt reached his career at the judiciary point, measuring the clock.
World records born in Berlin at 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 twentieths are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is seeking 200 metres of world records and 19 seconds of subcontraction, but no one believes that it was born but Bolt himself.
In the 100th century, Bolt’s very challenger is Justin Gatlin, the 100th Olympic winner of Athens 2004.
Last year, in the Beijing MM final, Bolt defeated the American in only one hundred seconds.
Bolt has not lost in the final of the precious races in Beijing once, if he has just reached a journey.
In 2011, the MM final of the 100 was left out of Bolt because of a bad start.
Bolt fills in a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the young men's species, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the next year's MM competitions in London as the last goal of the career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm downstairs, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrated interview.

The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyin doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
The Bulgarian drinker Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping crime.
In addition, a Kenian general sports coach was sent to your home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
He was ranked in Rio in a quarter of a woman's 100 metres perfume.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estano, the Chinese bather has taken its doping case to the International Tribunal for Sports to address CAS.
Xinhua says that a sample given by Xiny on Sunday had been found in a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There are also other doping doubts in Rio.

There is no stopping Phelps - historical gold came into the show style
The most successful athlete in the Olympic history, American Michael Phelps, was swimming 200 meters in a mix of the 22th Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic Golds.
At the same time, Phelps first swimmered with the Olympic Gold of the same species in the fourth successive races.
The winning time of Phelps was 1.54.66.
Japan Kosuke Hagino was placed in a confusion before China Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, and BBC's Olympic Olympic Commander Helen Skelton laughs at the evening's instant interview.
Helen Skelton (oik.) is the most reader of this week on the website of the evening magazine.
Next to the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not much stressed if some or British press has a small spot of his revealing and special outfits.
Television is visual media, he stresses.
Skelton has dressed in high-rate shoes and short dress with at least enough exploration - at least in the eyes of many conservative British views.
But the back steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and the small ones are just a funny thing.
Skelton is sure he wants to shake and maybe he's intimidating, but he stresses that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're watching sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the womb has risen to Finland?
I can't, but all that focuses on how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they make, is OK for me, Skelton sniffs.
You know what?
It's an empty thing if it comes from a (contractor) dressing.
I'm a little fun if this one's hit someone's radar.
Rio Police arrested two suspects of terror
On Thursday, Rio's police announced that it's arrested two people due to the suspicion of terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the security of the races.
In the same context, the police took five other arrests and interrogated two people before they were released.

The arrested are believed to have connections to the Isis Extreme Organization.
The arrested were known to have caused violence in social media.
Messages to violence were distributed, among other things, in the popular WhatsApp service.
The safety of Rio's races is responsible for 85,000 police.
The police exploded a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start the Rio basketball tournament in their first block of matches in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball area and closed the place from the public.
The police allowed the public in after they had been controlled by exploding the package.

Argentine's Lady Pucked the Fakeer-Siren - The Finnish Thinking Protestant
Wind Pester-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Fake-Siren cooked hard on Thursday.
Argentine’s lady hanged the Wind in Rio on Thursday at the opening of the day of women’s surfing.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted a breach.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away, said Finland’s chief coach Joakim Wilenius.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing it because it would have been in vain according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen in the water so I could have received a refund, and I was told by Pestler-Siren.
The Finnish man hanged on his board until the last time, because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
With the accident, the Finn stayed in the 27th place.
In total, London’s 2012 Olympic Olympics are eighth.
There was little impact on the crash.
Friday is an important day when we have a race to leave 10-12.
Amended 0.39: Unlike the first knowledge, Pestler-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, extend age
Science has studied everything possible between Earth and Heaven.
These things have been proven to bring extra years to a person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life lasts.
Sometimes things that a person cannot affect himself can bring him more years.
These include, inter alia, a tendency to middle body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping may extend the age.
Always don't even have to break, just to get the milk can.
The secret of a long age has been tried to find out for many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinks have been found to be protected from cancer, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
Harvard University’s research found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "small death risk", especially with neurologic or heart-based diseases.
Again, on behalf of the alcohol, research that reasonable use - one to three days - may extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental wire use can extend the life of a person for more than six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents ancient infections.
They can also contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in other human bodies.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected human life.
For seven years, more than 54,000 people were watching the project.
Those who laughed more were more grievous than 35% more likely to be alive after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when the protection of sex diseases has been taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex in the same way is not enough.
To give a person more years of life, he must also get an orgasm.
Movement, of course, will bring more years, and it will not be denied.
However, a long-term age does not require absolute solacticity.
One study at the University of Oxford found that women with a large backside had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
It was then an athlete or Oscar winner who had become an Olympic athletes, he is more likely to live longer than a normal giant.
Many researchers have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring his life more years.
Some researchers doubt that the long-term age is due to the social status of a person - which, for example, contributes to the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
The study on the shopping behaviour of over 65 years of age found that a person who shops daily, i.e. less likely to make purchases older.
This is due to the fact that cycling in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may early death.
So count your credit card on your hand - the online hobby has no same effect.

Wishing of the family of a woman who was murdered in a sense: the memories of the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by donation for police work.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it will provide the sacrifice of donations for police dogs for the family's wish.
The publication states that the victim had worked at the Sipoon Veterinary Station as a substitute and also carried out his nurse’s training there.
The veterinarian's station reminds me of the words that touch the woman.
Joyful, smart, sense of humor and work is fearless.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donation funds will go in full to police dogs, primarily to purchase security flags.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisan woman was murdered in his own homeyard in the Koskenkyl of Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbors have said the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flower.
A suspected 27-year-old man did not know a woman or had any contact with each other.
The murderer was tracked by a police dog Börje, who was injured in a life-threatening situation.
Börje survived and is recovering.
The law of the person who was in charge of the infringement of the Act of Equality was ordered to Post
The post had no right to detain the salary of a refusaled employee for the examination of the rental worker, assessing the right of executive law in Kanta-Häme.
Post ordered the employee to pay most of the salary received and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only part of the employee’s salary, which corresponded to the share of the study throughout the day’s work.
According to the law of the guardian, the employee was placed in a more favourable position on the basis of his trade union activities against the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the Union for Postal and Logistics on the PAU organisational decision on the prohibition of learning.
During the last year's postal strike, PAU decided that postal workers do not study the rental workers who violate the strike.
The People's News first told me about it.

Putin separated the head of his administration to replace a viro-speaking persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed president Sergei Ivanov, Kreml.
The Soviet Communist Director Karl Vaino's son Anton Vaino will be replaced.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as vice-president of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired his government chief.
According to the Kremli Communication, Ivanov, which belongs to Putin’s close interior, will move to specific environmental and transport tasks.
Putin said Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed persecution to be replaced, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union for the KGB spying.
Many viewed Ivanov as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President of Putin in 2011 before the re-election of Putin in 2012.
BBC: ManU's Ticket Procurement for Game Ban - can't be seen at the Open of Valioliiga
The World Recorder of Football Transfers will not be seen on the field when the English Valioliiga is kicked on the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban was followed by England.
Due to the ban on the game, Paul Pogba, Manchester United is on the page opening his league against Bournemouth on Sunday, said BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million for the Italian Society Juventus from Pogba.
However, the UK Football Association FA keeps him away from the game, as Pogba has left Juventa to be a challenge for the game ban.
He received two warnings in the last season in Italian cups, and it becomes a single game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, FA told BBC.
Pogban's next seam is playing in the second round of the league, 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is good.
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established the position of the Flow Festival as an internationally respected event that the world’s top artists are staring.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
Festarchs have typically expressed themselves with their own dress.
One of the artists of the head is this year the punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stylished, among other things, by artificial law and art installations.
We have never had enough to just beer and beer, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival held this weekend in the Helsinki Suvilahde has grown from a small block festival to a event of tens of thousands of visitors.
In the background of success, there is a simple question: what kind of event would the factors themselves want to go?
In the event of an injunction, it is quite unusual to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the authorities’ regulations, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell this year to the end.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors last year by 5 000 people.
Festars will also see a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because it needs to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point, the mass would be like a flock of livestock that is guided in huge roads.
That's what we don't want.
Ideology has been expanded over 13 years so that there are 130 presences in the area that have been partially arranged with artificial lawn, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars.
In addition to the main ferry and smaller stages, this year the tent of 15,000 people operates.
Kallio admits that the event could be done more easily.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If it disappears, this is no longer our thing.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done to Kallio is that today there are many visions that are practically possible.
During the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the operation was very dependent on the aid of approximately EUR 20 000 in the city of Helsinki.
Last year, the turnover of the Flow company was approximately EUR 6 million.
It allows you to create "great things" like building that 73 metres wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event is not consciously profiled as specially fashionable.
We want to be separated, above all, with content.
However, the fashion phenomena also match the value world of Flow: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists of the head is the legend of the punki, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer of indierock, pop music, rape and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was busted because it is probably the last time we see it in Finland.
All of us are interested in history and future.
Not just what the commercial radio plays.
Iggy's last record is damn good, and he's done damn good work in the past few years.
The bombs of the Thai tourist paradise were hidden in the flowers - tourists fled in their horrors
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded local time on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were hidden in a flower bag and exploded with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were exploded at the same time as tourists began to leave bars and return to their hotels, according to the police representative Samoer Yoosumra CNN.
Since 1989, Asian wildlife protector Edwin Wiek had a lot of impression on the attacks.
If the TV doesn't look good, you can look at it here.
There were at least 11 foreign tourists in Hua Hin.
The people ran against me and said the bomb was exploding at the bars.
It was one of the biggest bar streets, told the Swedish secretary Emelie Olsson Aftonblade.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon after that, the Finnishs also favoured the Phuket island, exploding two bombs.
No one is known to be dead.
At the same time, there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang.
The police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin, who had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombing attacks that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, there may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been engaging in the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new emergency forces will go to war first.
In the acute war situation, warlords are ordered to fight duties only after several months of the admission of military light, says Central Finnish.
According to the Head of Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnis, for example, 5.5 months of armed officers in the war situation are only those who are in battle at the end of their education.
According to the Head of Education, the reserves belonging to the emergency force are first assigned to the service.
None of the guardians or reservers are ordered for a task that has not been given the required training, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, the Defense Forces began to train armed personnel in immediate capacity units from next year.
Units can be used in military operations during the training of the war.
Pamela Tola received giant compensation from the home house
Actor Pamela Tola and his ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a hard dispute in the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The price of the two-layer separate house was EUR 330 000.
However, after trading, there was a serious moisture problem in the house that caused a dangerous microbial growth to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment as a decay in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198,000.
The couple brought the case to court and demanded a discount from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in the court and at court.
The court ordered the judgment on Wednesday.
It held in force the judgment of the Court of Justice, ordering the seller to pay to Tola and Waroma for a discount of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the costs of the couple’s proceedings and investigations of EUR 47 344.
The right to a reasonable reduction of price slightly, as some of the need for repair of the apartment had already been known by the buyers when making a housing trade.
However, the reported construction errors were more serious according to court law than had been stated.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told me in court that the couple had specifically searched for a decent home because they did not want to take up repairs.
He was born with the idea that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the points mentioned in the fitness check report are not harmful.
The fitness audit report referred to as risks and inadequate ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting waters floating along the rockworks.
However, the discussions did not show that it would have been an urgent issue.
Tola and Waroma believed that rainwater from the rock might have to be controlled a bit within a few years.
The trades were made in October 2009.
In a few years, it appeared that the humidity problems of the apartment were much more serious than thought.
In the 2012 and 2013 inspections, the building found microbial growth caused both the rainwaters of the rock and the capillary rise.
On the west side of the house, the air polluted by microbes could also be accessed through the villa.
The possible health risk, the limit values above the bucket or ski were found in the wing samples in the housekeeping room, the basement staircase, the living room window evaporator, and the basement washing room.
The terraces were built without permission
The court also contested whether the apartment was extended against the construction permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the city of Espoo before the trade was made that the apartment had been subjected to anti-licensing changes.
For example, the terraces were built, even though there were no appropriate permits yet.
Home problems were, however, a key issue in the court.
According to court law, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living in the same way and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
According to the Court of Justice, there was no particular reason to carry out a wider inspection.
Buyers have not neglected their obligation to report, the court states in their judgment.
Fearful archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - in the register also Finns
The journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent Dagens Nyheter article about the records recorded in the National Archives in the United States in Maryland, about 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi Morsiame.
Documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-Germany Race Agency.
The Race Agency was under the responsibility of Heinrich Himmler, CEO of SS.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was studied by the SS doctor.
The same was the case with even more women who had to be able to give up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were conducted gynecological studies to investigate the matter.
The Race Agency investigated the backgrounds of women, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in women’s family.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Race Agency handwritten life stories and good recommendations to the closest.
The Race Agency wanted guarantees that women were "children", "safeguards", and "good national socialists" who knew very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme, among other things, stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, the U.S. Holocaust Museum websites are reported.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The German mother’s tribute was granted to women who had received at least four children.
The marriages between the Nazi-Germany and the "non-arhians" were legally prohibited, the museum’s pages were stated.
The Sixth of the Faller-Sire, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was the third sailing in the first day of the Finnjols, leaving the Rio Olympics, but the whole group left the tail of the second day.
In the whole situation, the nigger rose eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second exit dropped him instead of 14.
Wind Pester-Siren fought in the RS:X class days leaving places 17 and three.
In the overall situation, the deceased-Siren is the sixth.
In 470 classes, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren stayed in the opening of the day at 23.
The Lindgrens are in the 19th position.
Jari Sillanpää Satulinna recorded a couple of hours in the night: "I was so in a canvas"
Jari Sillanpää has been part of Finnish favorite arts for more than 20 years.
The Bar Mickey of the Crushing Ship for the Tangonian of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the stars of dance ferries and festivals, the Sillan Head continues to take the porsk, and he is currently in a bold lift.
The book written by Mari Koppisen, a favorite singer’s life, Jari Sillanpää, was published on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and evil.
The career of the bridge grew into a total rise in his winning of the Tangonian Crown in the Tango River in 1995.
In the race, the Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece on the bridge at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finland’s music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: the bridge head sang it on the tape in a terrible crab and only after a few hours of nights.
We had a party tonight.
I was so in the canvas!
The bridge head remembers in the book.
A huge hit from the capture of the song would not instantly imagine it was sang in the crab.
Although I wasn't physically at my best, the trace was still good.
I learned that it is not necessary to demand the perfect and excellence of myself all the time.
Another incident related to the most popular songs of a man, which was reported in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, the Sillanpää separated from his partner and the case ended in the texts of the gold piece that was published in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered from the Saara Collect were not the same as the Sillanpää would have wanted.
The bridge head had imagined that he was making a record that tells the truth about his own life, but the words of the song of the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 days.
In the news of the newspaper, the reason for the difference between Jar and the ex-loved was that of Jar’s excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jar said it was a full bunny and not true.
According to the book, Jari called the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of the voters had a difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even if the vote week’s opinion measurements anticipated the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
None of the highly respected research institutions or universities have flagged the difference, even though a couple of individual researchers had to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The main mantra of Western politics, former President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid", flew a rumour in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic guitar language
The Centre for Macroeconomics has the latest monthly survey from the professional community to answer the Brexit disaster.
The answer of the type is that the economists were not listened, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economists' explanations for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have an imagination that the number of jobs is independent of the number of workflows, so almost standard.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the right British.
Many also have the idea that the depreciation of the value of the currency would be a good thing because it contributes to the export industry.
According to the Economy, voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, BBC's equitability, which gave only a few percent of the economists representing the EU's difference to economic scientists as a superfluous majority.
The EU-inspired press was not interested in telling the opinion of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic specimens on the consequences of the difference.
These remote letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, state debt and currency.
And if the economists were both listened and understood, they were not communicated because the economists represent an elite with which voters do not think they have common interests.
The academics of major cities such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message in small cities and rural areas did not work.
Immigration is also a economy.
The overwhelming argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will congest your hospital, the immigrant will use you.
These arguments worked out.
Every café has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In each health centre, we see immigrants in the waiting room.
How much easier would the British get medical times if they weren't?
Every school has immigrants’ children as well.
How much easier would the real British kids get a school place if they were released?
Every municipality lives foreigners.
How much more space would the early people have if they left?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, apartments and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they succeeded, their responses did not receive visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, less health centre lines and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and, in particular, EU immigrants - are British net public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Reserved in Brexit Cash
One of the funds was the Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are responsible for the Finnish Pertti Old.
According to her, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the winning of the EU-department camp, was started to be more prepared for a few weeks before the vote in case the result was left.
The problem was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
The Real Estate Funds do not normally have large liquidity funds, but now they could be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23th day, we had 25% of the investment in cash or liquid funds, the old man says Aberdeen’s only open daily notebook of the real estate fund covered by the news.
According to the old, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The value of the fund was 3.5 billion at that time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in the nine Open Real Estate Funds, the Old Man says of all Open Real Estate Funds in the UK.
He estimates that the lowest cash in these funds remained 10% or even below it.
Thus, the building funds reserved very different strategies for Brexit.
Funds closed trade
When the EU-promoting camp won, Europe went insane.
However, few of the two weeks following the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, said the Old Man.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney’s speech by the Director-General of the Central Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
They kidnapped the situation together and brought it to the headlines of Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Old Man.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball began to rotate, and the fund afterwards had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good due to the cash collected, but it eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it is worth pulling the money out of the panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of them canceled the notification.
After that, it was quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, the old man says.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen European Funds have not had any similar deterioration.
But there were a lot of surveys.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
The old man believes that the closures of trade in real estate funds received undue attention.
The open funds covered by the closures govern approximately 4% of the UK property.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds on half of 2017.
Currently, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been ripped down, but the situation does not seem to be "stronger" for Aberdeen.
The main questions are now about the future development of the UK economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought some new opportunities for real estate investors, the old man points out.
The exchange rate for pounds and dollars is the weakest in 30 years, and there is a 15% reduction in the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property at a discount of up to 30%.
There are lots of buyers, old man says.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market
Two nights in the morning, the situation didn’t look so bad yet.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for Aberdeen Asset Management’s real estate investment, re-waken to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The word of power was in it.
I realized that this is going to the plan B now, the old man says in his second home in Helsinki.
He went to work right away.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning night.
The news was supported by the TV boxes normally silent in the office, and usually the loud people quietly listened completely when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell his divorce.
When the market opened, the screen ends flashed just red.
It was a morning that I would never have believed he would live, the old man says.
It is therefore not because, despite the abolition, Aberdee, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, finalised two real estate trades on the day following the Brexit vote.
The feeling was confusing.
However, the company was well-prepared for the option, and therefore the situation was kind of calm, says the Old Man.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leader went into exchange.
The market began to predict severe invoices for the UK and especially for the London real estate market.
There were up to 20% of mines in London’s office premises in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade after each other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm is down, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not show its last summer holidays on the face of the Old Man in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is too early to say much about what comes from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first informed.
CBRE’s information on price development covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all London buildings fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, minus accumulated 6.1 per cent, the old man listed.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, says the old man.
All equally high drops hit the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was relatively quickly compared with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis from the US real estate market.
The old man believes that the parable is not quite a match, as it is now a domestic crisis in the UK.
The emotion is also another.
The real estate market has now not seen such a panic sales as that time, but the willingness to sell better liquidity, says Old Man.
There is also a financial guarantee normally.
The repair movement could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, the price repair is not a miracle for him - that could have been before without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of property in London and other world-wide cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and, in particular, the offices are overpriced, the old man says.
So the fall started very high.
London's prices have risen up for four reasons, the Old List.
The UK economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estates are the last ownership class that is globalized, Old Man says.
Middle East and Asia have become new players, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment destinations abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by a low level of interest, for example, for pension companies have had to seek revenue from new items.
The loan has been readily available on this – although, according to the Old People, the debt has now been clearly used in less than during the period preceding the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the price increase slowed down last summer, the old man said.
Even Aberdeen began to reduce its ownership in London, and last year he was a net salesman.
There was some kind of translation, and now it came.
What's going on?
It depends on how the UK economy develops, the old man says.
A lot he dares to assess the future, but he says that there is hardly any rising moment.
The emotion suggests that there is a dropling or a steady shift in front of us.
The old man has already seen more movements up and down since he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the couple will be survived with work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much of a victim.
If it has been decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, the Old Man says.
S Group starts registering purchase information in more detail than before
The S Group will know what you are eating, as the trade group told us today that more detailed information will be collected about buying their stock customers.
Up to now, when information has been collected on the final amount of the receipt, the group will start with it also from the purchased products at the beginning of May.
The S group is here after Kesko, as the data of the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a few years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO Ismo Riitalan, the feedback from the program has been mostly positive.
The product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing authorisation.
The most effective channel is email.
Quite few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to the Economy statements.
He said Kesko will not respond to the changes in the registration of the S group.
Kesko already categorizes its customer in ten groups according to the only food shops.
The classification is updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount used for them.
The information is used for targeted marketing for the customer.
Product-specific purchasing information is collected only from the K-group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a base client program and does not have that in this case.
The Finnish Neighbourhood Store has its own single-bonus client program, which can be associated with the Choicehouses, Siws and Euromarkets.
We are currently not collecting product or product group information, we remain at the end of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made and what day, and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level like the K group or the S group, says Anu Ora.
According to him, the stock-asiakas programme is to be reformed in the future, but the Middle Trade will tell you later.
However, Ora does not promise that the product information should be registered.
Initially Experiment
The SOK customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive until now.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information includes professionals, training, housing form, and the births of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase date and time, place, total purchases and payment method has been recorded from the S-Price card purchase.
In addition, S-bonus partners’ information has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase information at the product level begins to be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In the S-markets, Prisms, Home Terros and ABC chains, the information is still recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partners of the SOK.
The S Group says they will inform their customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the information is stored in the bags anyway, wanted it or not.
You can check your data on the S-group website.
For example, the cash is not available, stresses Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is the latest dog confirmation of the Tulli - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador driver's puppet sweeps intensively five boxes in the same country at the Helsinki-Vanta airport.
It won't take long when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with its favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a bottle of carton gas was found.
The rust gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and access to online trade
Heila is the first dog specialized in the search for weapons and explosives and is placed to work at the Helsinki Airport next year.
Working tasks may take Heila and Suntion to other border crossings and ports as well.
However, the airport will be the main job in Heila because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris-Brussels attacks caused measures in Tulli and after the attacks have been confirmed, says Mikko Grönberg, inspector of Tulli.
Another access to training of weapons and explosives is posts through Helsinki-Vanta.
With an increased internet trade, the airport will pass up to 40 million postal transmissions each year, including foreignly ordered weapons and explosives.
In recent years, the Customs have made online shops in Helsinki-Vanta airport, about 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their origins.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered baggage and mailing.
In ports it will have a great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more accurate research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether weapons and explosives will be trained more in the future.
Grönberg is looking forward to the idea.
School in Churchnumme
The training of the Heila penis is coordinated by the School of Dogs in the Church.
Suntio also attends the police and defence force experts with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and defense forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs decide together with other authorities what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Hela will always be further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport have six drug dogs in Tulli, as well as a money and drug dog Massi.
Labradorindator Heila has been selected from the ten puppy puppies.
The choice criteria for the dog to be selected at the airport include a cavity and a hunting ticket, as well as calmness, as the dog is in contact with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila is a close associate with the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Without Heila, there's no way to get anything at home, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders will go to Heila from a single box.
The cameraman of the evening-words loses a camera for a quick dog, but Heila restores a soft toy-looking protection immediately from the "irti" command.
Hard competition for work dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, which will assess whether training is sufficient for demanding work tasks.
Heilan can be seen at work in the next half of the year, if everything goes according to the plans.
Travelers can’t unfortunately come to silence the working vests on the dog, reminding Suntio.
The cost of one work dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owners.
Working days can be long, between eight and ten hours, but active working shares can only last from 10 minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the dogs is a hard competition in Tulli.
Helala was the owner of around 20-30 Tulli employees.
Happiness hit the Suntion site that had never had a dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Tulli.
The Ministate received its first Olympic Medals - the people get a free day
A shorter than a million inhabitants of the Fiji Olympic Gold in Rugby will be so high in the country that the government has ordered the 22th of August for a national holiday.
According to the country’s broadcaster, the Fidži government confirmed the championship.
The free day will be on the next day of the team's return.
The hero team also has celebrations in its country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian says that the country was following the final in the capital city of Suva, where my screen was set up for the stadium.
Normally only the Native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants they watched the game, I heard them encourage, said the journalist of Fiji Times to Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish singer fainted after the brutal performance
Milko Tokola succeeded in his last company from 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature.
During the criminal lifts, or immediately after them, he has passed out several times.
No one really knew why.
Tokola scored 175 pounds and 145 pounds in Rio.
His joint result was 320 pounds.
Tokola was trying to get his job at the last time 175 pounds, as did the other one.
With the third company, the weights rose as a shout.
The body was trembling under weight until the judge accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish advocate was the fact that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired a virolai chef Prosan - Skills League - Ilta-Sanoma
The Rovaniemen Palloseura in the football league of men has concluded a lasting agreement with Albert Prosa.
We are looking for the top player in our team with power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
With more than ten players agents, we went through a lot of 50 players from all over the world.
A small number of people began to be separated as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen, said in the newsletter.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from the winter Flora where he made a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian country team.
Prosan should be involved in RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki where the Rovaniemeans meet the dominant Finnish master SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when the last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Dangerous Modern Family Star meets again: the Teen Shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who was familiar with Alex Dunphyna as a gentle family comedy series, re-entered by presenting his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minihorses that don’t leave much of a imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also the back of this.
Winter, 18 years old, has recently attracted attention by making his style and behavior more brave.
The star has posed in pictures published in social media in very few clothes and took a number of tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen to wear very small clothes.
Winter has recently published several photos of his own celebration.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
In this case, the founder of PowerwomenTV and CEO Amy Palmer suspected Winter has a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on TV almost all his life and has grown during the era of Kardashians.
He has learned that the more exposes the surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen in countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series only 11 years old.
The actor has been depressed by some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where he is in ten years, when the bottom is already so hard, a woman in Winter’s Instagram says.
Instead, some of the women's fans defend the actress and asks not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what others say.
You are an inspiration for many women, inspiring a young woman.
Japanese want Nordics preferably to Finland - tourists are attracted with a revonul: in the autumn it is possible to see a saturated mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japaneses to start revontulimatkas from the beginning of the autumn, Visit Finland says in the newsletter.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Japanese revonuous tourism.
Revon fires are the articulated cards of our winter travel, and they are strongly combined with the heart winter and snowy landscapes.
In the winter of Lapland, there is a very demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the revonussonk begins from the early autumn and continues far into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the revontules of the vision of the two layers of saturated, says Visit Finland v. marketing manager Anne Lind.
Visit Finland’s main target group is wealthy 25-35 years old, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to the survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers at Turku and Tokyo University, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive land image among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and this revont has a huge potential according to Lind.
Overnight stays for Japanese tourists have increased significantly more than other Nordic countries in Finland.
Last year, they stayed in Finland more than double than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finland’s tourism as a target group, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese used EUR 183 per day in Finland, Lind says.
The United Kingdom had to be satisfied with the rugby-7 race when the Fidz championship won gold.
The UK’s impressive success in the seven players’ rugby race broke down brutally when Fidzi won it on Thursday in the final of Rion Deodoro Stadium in the 43-7.
Fidzi taught the masters in ball processing, transfers, side depositions, support game, running lines and brutal power, and won gold – if the country had the first Olympic medal of all its history.
Death meant silver, which was a little more thin to the UK, for it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They can be proud of their success as the Olympic race for the first time in the rugby-7 tournament in which the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
During the seven to five semifinals of the South African Boks, the team could have been negatively influenced in the finals on the same day.
Despite this, the Fidz team would have won the British, even if the 15-year-old team had full power.
The United Kingdom may be comforted by the fact that at least one British will receive a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: the former coach of the British Rugby-7 team from Wimbledon, the Fidz principal coach Ben Ryan.
The experience has been quite for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in Ryan's training at the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Killing hurts, but progress is incredible.
Fidzi started greatly and presented his tackling skills to the United Kingdom as a result of fun.
It seemed like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had crashed into a crowd of mobile buses, and the world champions got up to 5 to 0 when Osea Kolinisau hit the corner.
When it was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai made another goal on the right line of the goal.
The situation between 12 and 0, and the UK had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's great bucket prevented Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it didn't slow down Fidz for a long time.
When the game was played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made the goal at the right angle, after which the UK had 17-0 losses.
Nakarawa made a second goal of further initiative, where the first half of the game time was still more than a minute left.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou crashed through more invincible fights in the UK team and crashed over the goal line.
After the paint kick, the opening period ended with 29-0.
It seemed like the Fidzians were born to play the rugby of seven players, while the British are still in the role of the student.
Which is much true.
In the middle of the UK, the UK made extensive changes and managed to hold the Fidzians for four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova made the goal thanks to the excellent team of the Fidzians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation 36-7 by making the United Kingdom a goal to the left corner, but the game had long ago been lost to the islands of the South Sea, whose fans sang, shining tickets and dancing.
Fidz’s purely delightful attitude was difficult not to admire.
Mata Viliame made a final seal for the Fidzians cake by making a goal at the last few moments.
Pill rings, fidzians embraced each other and the British fell on the field, perfectly crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fidzi had won Japan’s semifinal in the figures of 20 to 5 and the United Kingdom had passed by South Africa in a strict semifinal where the balance was solved by the UK’s goalpot.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boks to the lead during the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with his glittering footwork and fell under the paint stops in the second half.
Marcus Watson, who is a rugby team player of 15 players in England, is the brother of Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
The Battle of Coach against Cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to make gold
This more emotional could not be gold in these races.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning played 220 winning bets in history and found an additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were two in airs, the third voice of coach Robin Williams, insisting them on another successive Olympic culture in women's twins. This makes them the first women in the history of British sports, which are amazed at a similar achievement.
Their overpower was uncontroversial, the victory was for them the 39th consecutive and once again recording.
What we see is that two fantastic athletes joining on the water level as you go through the ages, are not fully matched with the nature of success.
There are a large number of helpful hands behind each bowl, each of which has contributed to two achievements. However, the most important of the aiders is the coach that diagnosed cancer 30 months ago and who then did not know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
“I had urinary cancer, and the tumor was able to cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It's changing a bit of thought."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The three were fortunately lucky for Williams to start their treatment outside the season of 2014, where the interruption caused as little damage as possible if you could even say this in this kind of circumstances.
“I needed money, so I had to improve quickly.
It was a motivation.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
The war itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger.”
Shortly after the victory, the thoughts of the twin were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and spoken a little more normal when attempting to win his own restlessness.
Captain Stanning, the British Royal Firequarters, who had a trip back to Afghanistan, says, "I have been in ruins this week, which may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
“It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we work together with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen and Robin's cash has been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thank him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better person with whom to train, or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The twins have found an overwhelming rhythm for which their competitors have failed to draw comparisons.
Even in the last 500 metres when New Zealand and Denmark twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover had additional resources.
“We were very busy in the moment.
Helen told me, "Stop with me, stay with me."
It’s very important that you don’t get out of the route.”
“We managed to leave well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything wonderful.
“We didn’t want the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good war and win the race we did.”
The twins will think about a year before deciding on their future.
Glover celebrates next month with Steve Backshall, known as TV Nature Programs
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After nature, it took about six months before I realized I was the Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to realize.
It feels so much better," he says.
Iceland replaces the Panama leaks government
In October, Iceland will arrange premature parliamentary elections, which are already required by demonstrators who have been raged by Panama's data leaks in spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that several Islamic politicians have circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson divorced because of the scandal, but it was not enough for protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold new parliamentary elections in autumn.
The Election Day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last-term rage of the nation affects the autumn election outcome.
In June the presidential elections, the criticism of the empires was clearly shown, and Gudni Johannesson was elected president from outside of politics.
Trump said he was sarcasm when he claimed to be the founder of Obamaa Isis
Donald Trump, presidential candidate of the US Republicans, revoked his last speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that President Barack Obama would be the founder of a terrorist organization in Isis and a democratic candidate in Hillary Clintonk.
The Democrat Party became angry with speeches and demanded a apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone in charge of the army who can fall down around, Clinton's tweet.
In South France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of Muslims' favorite covert burkini swimming pools, including British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is prohibited to go to beaches and swimming for all who do not have a good way and have a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also says that bathing suits, which express greatly religious links, can increase the risk of order disorders in France, which has been subject to terrorist attacks.
In mid July, 85 people died and hundreds of people were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a population celebrated the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremists connected to fathers attacked the church in North France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the waters in the Oulu region passed through the screen - By the Parking Lake, the blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blu
Water samples taken from official swimming pools in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only in the beach of the Parking Lake has been detected with blue-blue stamps.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu region’s environmental action took water samples from nine EU coasts and 30 other general swimming pools in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the coast of Merinieme, the concentrations of all bathing waters in E.coli and intestinal gasococcal bacteria were lowered by the provisions of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and gasococcal water in the sea coast were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacteria were lower than the limit of action.
The blue sauce observed on the beach of the parking lake does not yet make water unswitting, but in favourable circumstances the situation may rapidly change as a blue-blue flower, making the surface of the water form blue-green resting ferries.
The environmental action will follow the situation with more frequent inspections.

MTK Hakkarainen for forest donation: More than 80% of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest gifts is one of the tax changes in the next year's draft budget of the Ministry of Finance.
Income tax laws are proposed a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the exchange of forest generations.
In the presentation of the Ministry of Finance, forest donation has four objectives: promote generation exchanges of forest farms, youngen the age structure of forest owners, increase the size of forest farms and increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the pure capital income of the forest economy.
Overall, the idea of making such a tool that promotes the generation of forest farms is good, commenting on the Director of the Central Association of Agriculture and Forestry Producers (MTK), Juha Hakkarainen.
However, Hadrainen finds criticism about tax change.
Forest gift reductions are presented as a task for the clean capital gains of the forest owner.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
The MTK and Hakkarainen believe that the tax reduction would be more effective if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the tree.
The presentation of the VM will lead to a reduction in the pure capital income of the forest economy by preventing the loss of the capital income of the forest economy, which should be reduced in other taxation.
Such a person would receive tax benefits even if the tree were not sold.
The calculation model is infinitely complex.
The average forest owner is unable to describe it, Haharainen says.
In addition, he believes that only a small part of the forest owners is concerned.
The limit for tax reductions linked to the return value of forests is EUR 40 000 in the presentation.
It's too high in Hakkaraise's opinion.
In such a way, he believes that 82% of Finnish forest owners are removed from the deduction circle.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the goal of growing.
Forest policy has been taken by Hadrainen for decades.
It is based on the age of the forest owner.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and around half of forest owners are pensioners.
The strong bruise surprised the car drivers in Himanga - two cars were sliding in the river and crashed together.
There was a special retreat on the Fish River Himanga on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Service, two consecutive times driven cars were sliding in their streams, after which he came behind, he crashed after the driver.
According to the day-to-day firemaster, Harri Pyydet is suspected of a strong rainbow.
In the back of the car there were two people transported to the hospital.
There is no more information about their injuries.
The driver who drived above did not get hurt.
The accident occurred on the 8th highway from Himanga to Kalajoki a few kilometres.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
The findings made by Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that cancer’s hardness increases cancer’s malignancies.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow in a normal way in such a environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented in laboratory conditions by returning the cancer surrounding tissue to the normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissues in the treatment of cancer cells.

The tree of the family home death continues in the court for both convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for family home death in Muho.
One received 8 years of murder and gross robbery, including a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years imprisonment of murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted was also sentenced to the risk of traffic safety as a young person and the transport of the vehicle as a young person.
The prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who received a more severe sentence were appealed to the court.
The prosecutor demands a lesser punishment to be condemned for the murder committed as a young person for 12 years of imprisonment.
At the time of doing, they were fully understood.
According to the law, 17-year-old young people killed a school home as a head of child protection unit, working for a man in July last year.
According to the justification of the judgment, the 17-year-old, the murderer attacked the director on the couch of the living room.
The director had been able to get rid of the shot and tolerate the young person in his room, and the other young people hit him with a sleeve.
The director was also strangled, hit and kicked in the head.
According to the mental study, both convicted were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from family home at least since the last day.
The ice shark is the longest spine in the world, grows only at the age of 156
The world’s longest living spinal cord has secured ice shark, says the research published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark swim around Greenland, i.e. the holker can live up to 400 years old.
The female is only growing at the age of 156.
The life of the ice shark increases the fact that it only grows in centimeters a year.
Only one species of chimps are known to live for longer ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age of radiocarbon drive.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, researchers were able to evaluate the age of sharks.
For the oldest age, 392 years were estimated, although the throw in the direction or another could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump’s Financial Wisdom - People’s News
Donald Trump America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the state's tax revenues would be lost if Donald Trump's changes to corporate tax were made.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular with the most wealthy tax incentives.
Trump described it as a revolutionary presentation in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax would decrease from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount of $1,000 billion a year without collecting.
The excess income tax rate is now 39,6, after the reduction made by Trump 33.
Heritage tax would be completely surrendered.
Trump accused the state of excessive trade regulation and of bankruptcy of small businesses.
Emergency-definitioned environmental standards must be reintroduced and energy regulation should be dismantled.
The Barack Obama Health Reform needs to be addressed again.
The administration must be appointed "executives instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, the “destructive” trade policy is the major cause of the US problems.
Free trade agreements would be canceled.
For imports from China, 45% and Mexico would be subject to a 35% penalty tax.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our credibility, Trump declared.
Donald Trump America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars are going to drive on the streets, American aircraft to combine cities, American ships to supervise the sea, American steel to lift new clouds all over the country.
Unlike Trump, he faithfully read the speech written by assistants, even though well organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those near Republicans, see Trump's program to drive the United States to deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released his own program on Friday.
Attack of the past - News of the People
The sea is devastating, but the real wave of attack strikes in the middle of Madrid's street hallway - an account with the past can begin.
The story of the Pedro Almodóvar.
Almodovar's previous control work Travel lovers (2013) was a little fun and ronskin-side satiir comedy, the predecessor of the skin where I live the tops of the Spanish career.
Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between these two works.
It is an intercontinental love, human relationship and family drama with a relationship between a mother and a daughter.
The story is a simple game and we see it as a long backpack.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) can be wondered until the end meters of the movie.
In the form of a back and long letter, Julieta repeated his life stages to his adult daughter.
He starts from time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, the time between Ommelta (2013-2014) from the TV series.
Juliet's age has been treated in a way that can be regarded as a stone, but I would say that it's a bit stubbornly and literally in a single swim.
For Almodóvar movies, there is always a fair distance in Julieta.
It is a flatly played, controlled, place in places with good music, and quite sadly a movie that has such elements to the gesture.
Instead, the characteristic visual colorfulness of the Spanish director is stored and in a way that it begins to put a little quietly in the eye more purely shaped than a working dramatic means of efficiency.
The people of the film are suffering from diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains one Korean.
This is especially true of the costume: in the case of a person of name, residents vary from the scene to the other, and the same applies to visible ears.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing is that the inspirations of the scene are not particularly improved.
Mechanically repeatedly, the impression is external and a little spiritless.
Almodóvar has written a script on the basis of three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro in Nobel 2013.
The novels have been published in the paper: reports.
Almodóvar has contributed to dialogue, resulting in a bit of a literary filming.
Ingredients would have been emotionally versatile to drama even more drama, so much of the big things - especially the cliffy guilt - deal with the thematics of the movie.
Direction and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Alice Munron is based on three novels.
Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - the People's News
No new cuts are made, ministers shouting so that the Finnishs do not fall completely.
However, the spring cuts are carried out by a grinding store.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk.) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.) are convincing the budget dispute.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM's presentation because social security cuts were already decided in the spring frame.
Children's supplements, national pensions, basic unemployment and almost all other benefits linked to the population pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of the unemployment security in the victims will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Educational surgery continues.
Continental Haunts
Why do the ministers stress that there are no new cuts on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities will be held in April, and they are the main heat meter of the electoral period, not the gallops.
It has already been seen that the government’s result in the different directions of the government’s political parties will be ruining the government’s atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallup states that the Government Party's basic Finns is expecting a loss, although the outcome of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finnishs received 752 new mandates, most of which will be realised in the first spring of the right government.
The life line of the three or more large parties is due to the need for the Finns to endure.
Now it has not endured, but more than half of the voters in the first year have had enough government policy.
The first signs of the party’s group’s visit have also come to the surface.
The new cuts will not come with rhetoric, first of all, the fact that next year they will be done dramatically and secondly, try to soften the expectant attack of the Finnishs.
Big Surgeons in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different - if the Sipilan government is still standing.
The government has set a target for the loss of debt during this electoral period, but the Petteri Orpo budget proposal will take EUR 5.9 billion next year, or more than this year.
After the municipalities, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government cannot follow its own programme: debt is not tailored or even slowed down.
Another thing is to stick to the program.
This means new, even more severe cuts on former people in the 2017 budget gap.
The budget would be at least close to balance in 2018, and then in spring, the parliamentary elections will be taken against what will happen.
These actions do not match debt
It is absolutely clear that the current activities do not match debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to lie down a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Martti Hetemäe’s budget in the awareness-raising of the state Secretary shall be uncontradictably witnessed by:
World economy growth forecasts have repeatedly proven to be overoptimist, i.e. not a petty aid from the international economy.
Finland’s economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has been extended from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
In the course of the rounds presented by the Seven, the debt of governments, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will rise to 70% in the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt promotion presented by the Left Association was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about EUR 6 billion, which is virtually fully covered by a new debt.
This is the idea of the Centre, the Assembly, and the fundamental Finns about what is responsible.
Question: The Government wants to leave a lot of tasks
Three of the four believes that the organisation of day care for children, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, it is evident from the study of the KKS - the Foundation for Development of the Kunnallis sector.
A clear majority of the people will also bring responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civil education, construction supervision, high school education and waste management.
The province’s responsibilities are more clearly desired for county plan, special care, vocational training, vocational higher education, and instituted care for developing disabilities.
None of the responsibilities of the municipalities is intended to be transferred to the state.
The underage driver ran to the police to run for a ride.
Joensuu’s 16-year-old motorcycler drove a police patrol in Joensuu at Ilomantsinti on Friday night at half a time.
The police department tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man left to drive the police to escape fairly high speed.
The rear drive continued on the Sonkajaranta road, from which it continued on the Sorronahontie and on the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle went out of the road.
After that, the young man left running away, but the faster-footed police ran into the escaper.
The blowing test for the driver showed 0.75 proms.
He also had no driving licence that would have justified driving a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, inter alia, as a serious risk of road safety.

The ingredients of the major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The tents of the Parafest festivals have smashed the drainage flow caused measurable damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafestation, estimates that the festival is economically accessible to its feet, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Parafest Kalle Salonen appeared at the end of Friday night on the market.
On Saturday, the program will continue at the city theatre's premises at the beginning of 13:00.
The Art Center in Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition from 13 to 15.
The programme is scheduled.
The eruption flow occurs in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight starts the decreasing air flow.
Changes in the water state of the umbrella cloud bind the heat, and therefore the falling air mass cools and it accelerates towards the ground.
It is reported by the Air Science Institute that the flows of falls occur in Finland during several summers.
It is difficult to predict the route of congestion flows.
In the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, the Parafest event was hit on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents collapsed, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the event of an accident, four people were mildly offended.
There was one child who was transported mildly injured to further treatment.
Air Pollutants Age Loss in London
According to the study, the skin of the lontoians ages faster than usual.
The reason for ageing skin is air pollution.
The British research says Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retirement-aged London is two and a half years older than the age companion living in the countryside.
Small particles that absorption the skin are very great dust pollution, which is from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, are killed by nearly 9 500 Londons every year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to pass the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk, especially for lontoans walking in close proximity to the congested streets.
People in London can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended to regularly clean the skin.

Anne Jumppanen has played almost all the Salibandy MMs since 2003.
The sixth race in Tampere is now going to take place, only 2013 after Canada was better in North America's cartoons.
I worked in Turku and played with women in the area when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy country team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.

Beach volley skilled Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM Gold is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is ending as a beach volley player, at least after a period of temporary duration.
Beach volley Finnish Championships will be resolved on the weekend at Kouvolan Sports Park.
During three days, the medals are played in both adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvolan Airball Players and the Finnish Airball Association, the SM final tournament will be validated for the six best pairs of each series of rankings.
The local color in the tournament represents Elimäen NMKY’s raised Essi Hasu, which has been part of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of the familiar audience.
I hope as many as possible get to the courtyard this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great stage for the pesistation.
I have not played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals in the home corners, Hasu feels.
The area of Kouvola ignited Hasu’s spark for sport and gave good food for a great hobby.
There are very memories of childhood.
I started the balloon at the age of 9 in the E-girls of Elimäe NMKY.
The top of the mind is too big toys, knee shields rotating in the nipples, as well as high ace lips and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small place, the sports club was a strong community where everyone knew each other.
The group’s common spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved, the father of the teammate trained us, and our mother was long-term president of the club.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already in junior time a natural choice for the inner balloon to counterweight.
In the 1990s, we have played songs.
The activities have always been active in the visitors.
I also went to follow the SM tour of the juniors, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays the weekend together with a brilliant Anniina Parkkis in the SM finals.
Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahde after the tournament the second ranked twin goal is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
The SM Gold is missing from the prize cabinet, the Funny throws it mysteriously.
The weekend in Kouvola may be the last known audience in front of Hasulle.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are expected in civil work.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toes are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli boldly went to a farmer
As an entrepreneurship, agriculture means risk promotions, sweat and charity.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer, because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Almost two years ago, Koli started working with his little brother Valtteri Kol as a continuation of their home space.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises brothers with their own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt and increasing so that bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy at the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a stove, and at first, the bank had not been enthusiastic.
However, I went very bravely into the project, and I’ve been involved in it, Solomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had not believed in producing pure Finnish food and that everything would still turn out good.
The goal of Salomo Kol’s breeding meat cars is to invest even more in its larger sleeves.
The work has resulted, as Solomon Koli has been selected for the ten best groups of the future of the countryside in the young food producer of the newspaper.
At best, he competes with potential winnings.
He will be able to vote on the website of the magazine until 21.8.

Snapchat anime efficiency is criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says that the filter was an anime, but some observers think it is racist.
With the Snapchat lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that converge absurdness.
You can turn yourself into an anonymous, dog or character in the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
The lenses are unprecedented, features distorting tools to create more than 30 million enhanced selfie a day.
All misunderstandings will quickly come to general knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have received a review where it has been accused of popularity of blackface makeup or whitened skin shades as a beauty bean.
So when it offered some of its users this week, a filter that changed their eyes into a twist, distorted teeth and made the cheeks pulled, some of the critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("Yellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated contradictions would refer to a greater problem that the company has with divergence.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday and it was written by e-publications The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat told me that he had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended to honor the anime characters, not the caricature of Asian people.
But to observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some denied the anime comparison.
The Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets were widely distributed from images, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing."
He adds: “It is difficult to deny that a very flavorless Asian caricature is compared to the filter’s efficiency.
It shows that the filter is not just "yellowface", but taken into degrading extremes."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for divergence and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s great audience consists of young people who are more ethnically different than their parents’ responses. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more fine-tuning.
"When one of the Snapchat lenses creates a picture that infringes the user, this type of things will no longer be very easily ignored, as previously," said Katie Zhu, a 25-year-old interview at Thursday.
Zhu, working as a product manager and designer in the Medium publication platform, decided to remove his Snapchat account on Thursday and encouraged others to do the same.
In the median article and telephone interview, he said he believed that the conflicts of ethnicity reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticizes the company’s mostly white and mere leaders and decided on the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that there are no colorful people in their unilateral staff to make such decisions, or they also have colorful employees, but their position is not such as to dare to express their opinions directly and easily,” said Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the argument.
The company does not publish numbers of its staff's ethnic backgrounds, betting its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of his staff, but according to its informant, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on sub-represented groups and to promote inclusion within the company.
In its part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: “I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK.”
According to the Congress Specialist Group, military officials distorted information about the Iss
On Thursday, the Congress Specialist Group published a report that the US Armed Forces, Central Command, had changed intelligence reports so that they would give a more optimistic picture of the war against Ishies in Iraq and Syria than the events on the field provided for understanding the subject.
The Republican Presidents of the Sub-Committee responsible for the intelligence and defence appropriations of the United States Committee of Representatives (House Armed Services Committee) set up a working group, which is an interim report of the "common discomfort of military intelligence analysts". According to analytics, the senior military authorities were decorated on the action of the Americans against the Iss.
Central Command, shortly Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in the state of Florida in Tampa, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results adopted by the senior leaders of the Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of anti-terrorism activities in the United States than the facts shown on the field, and were more positive than in the analysis of other entities in the intelligence community," the press release on the report says.
“Centcom’s events cannot be accepted – our soldiers suffer when the high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analyses,” says California Republican representative Ken Calvert.
"The errors in the Centcom leadership staircase are reaching the highest level of the organization."
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 which the Central Command’s descriptions and analyses of the American activities to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by the Obama administrations have been falsified, it will provide an image of analyticals that will be understood that Centcom’s leaders would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat caused by Isis.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and witnesses given to the Congress were much more positive than the events actually were,” says the report.
"For example, Centcom's official publicly issued a statement that a large military attack could be taken back to Moscow in April or May 2015.
Mosul, which is the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isis.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says Kansas Republican representative Mike Pompeo in the newsletter.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence leaders of the United States Armed Forces manipulated the intelligence results received to minimize the threat of Isis in Iraq.
The Republicans founded a working group after being aware of the doubts expressed by analysts that the information on Ishians had been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will follow more precise results as the studies will continue.
In addition, the Department of Defence has launched a survey on Centcom's intelligence data.
On Thursday, the Democratic Members of the Committee responsible for the Inquiry of the House published their own results, which were partially consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"In the years 2014-2015, Centcom created a too limited process for assessing the intelligence data on the Islamic and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, a high-level democratic representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results, "infringed the morality of analyticals" and "inadequately diverging views".
According to Schiff and Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure the Centcom analysts to adapt their conclusions to the "predetermined or political official line".
Daily Beast reported the initial results of the study conducted by the Congress on Tuesday.
Last August, New York Times told me about the Pentagon superinspector's investigation, which was initiated as a result of the complaints made by Centcom's analysts.
The reporter of Pentagon, Lieutenant Patrick Evans, says when he announces that the Ministry of Defence does not comment on the report of the Congress until the investigation of the supervisor is underway.
However, he says: “The experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcomes a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security.”
The investigation has other consequences, in addition to its efforts to determine whether the bombings led by the United States have been successful in Iraq and Syria (the statement made by more than one defence authority).
However, the arguments presented last year questioned how much President Obama could trust the Central Command and that it would give fair assessments of the military operation of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the data on fathers corresponds to the disputes that occurred over a decade ago, when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that according to the government of President George W. Bush, despite the objections of many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and used only a little time to reflect on what would result from the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebel of the father-in-law intelligence data.
According to the authorities last year, the Hoker Working Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, air strikes in the processing plants controlled by Isis had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group, since it had built temporary refiners and thus able to sell oil on the dark market.
However, the results of the study were not transferred outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
At the time of Centcom’s commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after many legislators had estimated that the Senate’s statements were too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the fourth double-debate in women's landhockey and establishes its position in interim analysis with the UK
After three goals in winning, Katie Bam made two first goals on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had succeeded in the same way before.
"I have no idea," he says.
“I don’t belong to people who like a number of paintings they have made.”
However, he knows that the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournaments and lost zero games and divided their group’s first place with Britain, who continued to win their winning pipes on Thursday, in Japan’s chapters 2-0.
The United States and the United States are playing in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams survived the final match, which determines which one of them is the first of the six teams and which one is the second.
The first is to avoid a longer time encounter with a hard-held Dutch team that won the second block.
Despite how it takes on Saturday, the Americans have already raised their surprising success in these races, four years after the last 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was in London as well.
He grew up in Blue Bell in Pennsylvania and grabbed the landhockey mat for the first time at the age of 3 (the older double sisters played a species in Drexel).
The 2008 Olympicians missed him when he failed to survive the final player list.
Then came the 2012 races, where he and his team had little success.
The following year, Craig Parnham was appointed coach, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," Bam said.
“Our job in London was not the same as it is now.
We have done a full translation.”
On Thursday night, Bam opened a paint account in the first half of the time by hitting the ball close to the raid.
India had come into the game without any tournament win, but it turned out to be a surprising opponent and kept the 1 to 0 situation at the third stage, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball a long way along the left side of the field, climbed the middle field, hit the ball and took the Americans 2 to 0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first tournament in which the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the American goal had been hit by each one.
Briggs now lives for his success.
Just like Bam.
“Our position is good now,” says Parnham, but how good it is, it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Olympiahulina in the middle of the trampoline brings zen
Depending on the place and time, the Olympics are inevitable.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions and struggles seem to be the next intense message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic Fire itself were a flammable message cap, moving from a swimmer to a swimmer, a bather to a powerer and a triathlonist.
You can’t open a TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour’s discussion in the café line without hearing the dispute between Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first time of the Olympics, Dooley, a charming smile, and it might well be the name of all the lips that would appear and belong to the best time of viewing and listening, would be the favourite of sponsors and would appear in good mind TVs if he were just a swimmer, racing or even a sword.
But Dooley, 28 from the California Lake Forest, competes with the Olympic Gold with a trampoline.
The Olympic light does not equally illuminate all competitions.
Far from the center, partly in the shadow there are less known sports, such as air pistol shooting, flex fire, feather balloon and taekwondo.
We will always have a breast-swimming, and keep the championship for a long time.
But if I can write a modest thing about my own special favourite, I would like to pay attention to the charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic race since the 2000 Sydney races, its visibility for the past 16 years has been so small that many people who interviewed didn’t even know it was the Olympic species.
Knowledge can be regional.
Of course, athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic Trampoline, but the country has never reached the medals or progressed in the finals until 2012.
Men’s trampoline medals seem to go to Chinese and Russians, and women’s side of medals are handled by Canadians.
The Chinese Dong Dong and the Canadian Rosie MacLennan defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, Trampoline has the charming power of the subordinate, partly because of the uncivilized replacement it sounds more suitable for the circus school than for the Olympics.
(I feel in this context that I am not an expert, only a ordinary fan.)
In the species, there is a comic potential that has been used in drawing films in the endless continuous poeming scenes of character. But it also has the same value as in gymnastics and swimming pools, i.e. species that are essentially connected to trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "stripping board".
Respectful masters jump with a huge trampoline that sweeps them up to nearly 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers have to make a series of acrobatic movements, such as circulars, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, the jumps are criticized based on performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, the championship of the trampoline forces competes with 32 athletes coming from 17 countries, 16 of them and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
When you aim for gold, you need to get further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the target line, sometimes backwards around the field.
In addition to the painting line or the wall of departure, they also have another goal to be pursued in television reporting weapons, namely the world or the Olympic recording.
This determined pursuit is magnificent, admirable, even fanatic – and enough to get a watcher into tears.
But I also think this is a little exhausting only in watching the races.
This trampoline offers a breathing break.
In Trampoline, the direction is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The forcer squeezes up as an astronaut, falls down and squeezes back up without any trouble.
Of course, there is also a competitive aspect of the species, and it is not easy, but it does not involve an intense attack on the goal or jumping far, only a sleepy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to the zen as only the Olympic competition can be reached.
Women's triumphs and finals are held on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local times and men's matches are held on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC sends finals as part of its afternoon shipment, which begins on either day at 14.00 local time.
In the middle of the Olympics, there is a peaceful and wonderful moment in the middle of the general hulina.
And if consciousness can only be increased by providing attractive male athletes and objecting them – as the US male forcers Wall Street Journal recently suggested – in this case Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans.
A whole generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-term U.S. ally
Violence demonstrations in Ethiopia
The government’s troops have disrupted protests that require political change across Ethiopia.
According to eyewitnesses, several protesters have been shot to death in confrontation with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a reliable Western ally whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government protests that are spreading to increasingly broad areas.
Only in the last week, thousands of people attacked the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to the Human Rights Organizations, the government's reaction was unpleasant.
According to eyewitnesses, the police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
The videos described in the end of the last year or at the beginning of this year are likely to show how security forces are hitting young people who have been forced to stand against the wall.
The UN’s leading human rights official now demands a thorough investigation.
“To keep the country united, it has always been difficult, and to move forward even more difficult,” says Rashid Abdi, Director of the International Crisis Group of the African Sarvi project.
Since Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, the Western countries have promoted stability.
The U.S. Army and intelligence services strongly support ethiopians in fighting terrorism threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if anything, get so much help from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital of Addis Abeba is even a new frequencies train.
The city streets are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, ethiopia is still far from the model country of democracy, and human rights organisations have constantly reported government repression policies, the opposition in the country is very limited, and the contradictors are rapidly stirred.
Many people have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
“If the people are suppressed, and there is no choice but to point out, it will explode out,” says Seyoum Teshome, who works as a writer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
“The whole youth shows its mind.
The whole generation protests."
There are many topics of displeasure, always from land to government coalition of power.
After the criticized elections of last year, the ruler party and its allies received the last position of the opposition, resulting in which they are now dominated by the whole Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are increasing at the Eritrea border, where the exaggerated situation required hundreds of death victims in the June battle.
Analyticals fear that more or less depressed separatist groups, such as the Oromo Breast of Liberation or the Ogaden People's Freedom Front, may try to exploit confusion and rearm.
For the reason why the bitter mood under the surface is dissolved right now, there are many reasons.
The first is apparently innocent: smartphones.
Only for the past few years, ethiopians have been able to communicate in social media when cheaper smartphones became common and the availability of the internet improved.
Even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many will be able to access the Internet through intermediary servers that hide their location.
Many ethiopian youths told me that they called people for demonstrations.
The second reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest populations in Ethiopia, oroms and amphrases.
Oromos and amphrases are not natural allies.
In Ethiopia, mostly from the top of Christendom, the Amhares have long ruled the country’s politics and business and stripped the oroes, most of which are Muslims and live in the Netherlands.
But this is also changing.
"The co-operation is deepening and we're getting under the same umbrella," says Mulatu Gemechu, Oromo Director.
The biggest protests have been in oromo and amhara regions.
Many amharas and oromos experience that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the tigren tribe, representing only about six percent of the population and, however, dominating military, intelligence service, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the restoration is the death of Meles Zenaw.
The former rebel leader, Meles, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died in 2012 for an unprecedented illness.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see behind the corner.
According to analytics, he was particularly skilled to detect the first signs of inconvenience and to use ambassadors that agreed on counterparts.
“The current government lacks this essential instinct,” says conflict researcher Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' boots from almost unknownness.
Unlike Meles, from the northern Ethiopia region, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he has no confidence in the security forces managed by the Tigre family.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
For the past time, there were similar riots in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands showed their minds against the elections that the government first had been twisted and then stolen by analytics.
In post-election restoration, many protesters were killed, although the dead were fewer than in the previous months, and the restorations ended relatively quickly.
Developing experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for remotely-visible infrastructure planning, such as the new spectrum train, and significant progress in combating poverty.
But the inner wrath against the government of Ethiopia has clearly not prevented the intensiveness.
And the grudge is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, the Amhara City in Gondar protesters attacked the companies owned by Tigres, and the hate speech against Tigres is becoming more widespread in social media.
According to analytics, protests put the United States and other Western allies in a bad situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighbouring aircraft in Somalia, but the base has recently been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its allies in the unstable region to fall.
“This requires strict balancing,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obamaa Isis
Donald J. Trump tried to draw his words back on Friday in the recent campaign, claiming that he was not serious in claiming that several times this week President Obama and Hillary Clinton terrorist group Isis "founders".
The clarification raised new questions on the Republican side of the presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of their country.
His supporters, who must try to defend their candidate at these storm moments and explain the comments he may not have meant.
Trump made the statement at the election conference on Wednesday and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he said the president and Hillary Clinton created Isis.
On Friday morning, however, Trump said he was a sarcasm.
Trump bounced his speech in the twit about the last day, when he said he was accused of several interviews.
When the radio broadcaster and the conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obamaha was trying to destroy Isis, the Presidential candidate of the Republicans refused to withdraw their claim.
Trump tried to focus his campaign back to the economy when his support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to go back to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and thought Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump's been defending the sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received a broad criticism when he seemed to urge Russians to hack Hillary Clinton’s e-mail. Later he explained his comments by saying, “I was sarcastic.”
In this way, Trump draws the boundaries of political speech and draws his words back, if necessary.
“I believe that it’s his way of testing certain messages that raise the response to his supporters. He sees how the supporters react to the messages, and “select” then in a way or in a different way, depending on the reactions,” says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
“But I also believe that he understands his claim and knows they are sufficiently circumcised to pass different seiners.”
Instead of softening his statements to the public of the election, Trump has changed his style even more intensely in recent days when his support figures have continued to fall.
The new study of the NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist published on Friday revealed that Trump’s support is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is strictly stable.
While Trump is usually trying to avoid asking for forgiveness to provoke his speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or failing to understand his sense of humor.
But after becoming a more accurate eye on their presidential campaign in the last few months, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in an embarrassing position in which they are publicly forced to defend Trump’s comments, no matter how provocative they are.
One of Trump’s most important supporters, former Mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, strongly defended the presidential candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think his words are justified, politically spoken," Giuliani replied when asked him whether Trump was truthful when he claimed that Obama and Hillary Clinton were founded by Isis.
“It’s true in the sense that before Obamaa Isis was almost unknown, a small organization named Obama as a "lower team" and that’s why he pulled the troops out of Iraq.”
Most of the Republicans representing the mainstream are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Hillary Clinton was Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed Isis to continue his activities when it did not deal with the situation determinedly in the Middle East.
Before Friday's elections in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of wandering his speeches and discriminating attitudes towards him.
He mocked “unworthy and compassionate” TV commanders trying to find out about him, but he said he couldn’t succeed in it.
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s explanation and said it would just show more clearly that he would not apply as president.
Due to an unreasonable increase in rent, the coffee shop will open in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a slightly explosive coffee shop in Williamsburg, where only cash was made and there was no Wi-Fi, but it offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the café was pricing out of its streetside at Bedford Avenue, when the rental went unreasonable.
Verb Cafen was replaced in summer 2014 by Soap Cherie sells soaps in the form of cupcakes.
Locals consider this under the mid-classification to avoid the loss of a coffee shop as a tragic.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York changes, I know, but I still can’t believe that there is no CBGB club anymore, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap store.”
But even though New York is no longer the same, there will be a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new coffee shop in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original place.
The new Verb coffee shop has Wi-Fi and can pay with credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unpleasant.
Coffee is still good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb coffee shop is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing it.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb space you bageled from the same supplier as before and used the same espressokone model.
In addition, it reintroduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new, and
added new products to the list.
There are pekoni-cannamon cheese-sandwiches available and filling capriks and onions.
There are also blackberries on the list.
There is no more beer from coffee, but instead fresh fruit juices.
After nine months of stay, Rodriguez said that old standard customers began to visit Verb as a steady stream.
“But many of our old clients were pricing out of Williamsburg,” he said.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the café on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34 years ago, lived in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
After moving to Greenpoint, he made a walk tours in Williamsburg to Verb.
When Verb was closed, he said he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I knew I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai-teaching instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a listing.
The second long-term customer, Tom Rosanthal, was faithful to Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and ordered the same.
“I went to the cafe every day for more than seven o’clocks as a machine, and there they already prepared my butbagel with all the fillings,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products on his menu.
Nowadays, Rosanthal still orders its standard products, but sometimes she varies from bacon, chicken egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have any adventures for taking the old place in the soap store.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to prepare a special sauce used in the manufacture of Verb’s own cold-crypted coffee.
"We'll get to the offer," says Rodriguez.
The Polish residents who lived in Greenpoint also welcomed the café.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbours feel welcome.
The new place has brought other advantages.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold-crypted coffee in the cafe.
Coffee may also be expanded to the next building.
However, many customers are enough to get their old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a standard client in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the café was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like it was coming home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of the cafe."
Food in the new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, soon after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as Kulinaristi, was pleased with the luxurious dishes of the Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose liver paddle and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, his table was more modest: the deviled eggs in the tomato sauce, potatoes and desserts from the plum pussy.
“It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” Jane Ziegelman said.
His husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat.”
The couple in Brooklyn Heights work as both food historians.
Coe’s latest book called Chop Suey tells of Chinese kitchen in America, while Ziegelman’s latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of the floorhouse in Lower East Side.
Their new joint work is published by Harper and published on Tuesday by A Square Meal, which describes the history of American food as a major devastation in the 1930s.
The couple showed its own culinary solidarity when agreed to a meeting with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and common lunch bar near the Flatiron cloudmakers, and opened in the same year as the big stock market crash, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a creamy cheese and olive-full sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkey, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the journalist ordered meat fragrance, the couple said it was suitable for a debate on the eating of a great period of lama.
"The problems were very popular," Jane Ziegelman said.
People ate peanut mushrooms, liver mushrooms, and beans.
They were made of substances that were cheap and rigid.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they will be enough for the whole meal.”
Andrew Coe's out of here.
"It must have been pressing in the stomach like a lead," he says.
Before the great years of lama, the American dish table, especially in the countryside, worked with the buffet principle, "eat as much as you want."
Women made food for farmers, and breakfast, lunch and dinner were served with renovated pies.
Just the Americans had sent food to starving Europeans during the first World War. A Square Meal is a chronic of ways that the people survived when suddenly they had to give up the magnificentness.
“This was the time when food became the central and annoying subject of Americans,” Coe says and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
A new affordable diet was one of the most disturbing things: according to Ziegelman, mysterious foods such as mowers and potfoods became the main food, and the pasta dishes were said to be a “great way to use the food stars” because the cooks could cover not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which had been the most important part of the American meal for many years, became sustainablely used luxurious.
We tried strange mixtures where the most important thing was the filling of calories and nutrients and not the taste or even a healthy kitchen lake.
When conducting a study for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared baking-time petals filled with peanut butter.
"It didn't get popular at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman added: “It was unrealistic.
Peanut butter and ovens are not compatible at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.”
Home Economy experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the federal household agency from 1923 to 1943, led citizens’ eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
In newspapers and magazines, they published recipes and articles and encouraged women to become accurate budget holders and respond to the challenge of making pork-kermaspaget kinds of tasty foods.
The A Square Meal book is a celebration of historical flavors.
Specially delicious are the explanations of the reaction of the government’s government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “sing me to eat cake” position.
While he publicly praised his child’s simple food on an iow farm, he himself ate, such as a millionaire and a finer who had become him.
"He liked Continental Europe's kitchen, like fish and cucumber sauce," Coe says.
"He ate almost a fire in a golden dining room, on his head with a smoking.
He was completely alienated from reality.”
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example in his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a nurse who was not at all interested in the taste, the foods served in the White House were not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst produced."
Many of the lama-time foods were rejected as soon as the land returned to his feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition remains reflected in how we pay attention to calories and nutrition and how science has been applied to cooking.
The couple tells us when writing the book, he began to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, for example, why he couldn’t throw food away.
“He really feared that food would have to be thrown away,” said Coe.
“The people even began to get sick of their foods,” recalls Ziegelman.
"Estimately, once in the winds."
When the main dishes were emptyed at the Eisenberg lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought out the nuts that they made at home, the same thing that President Roosevelt ate on his lunch.
"It's called plum vacuum," says Ziegelman, and adds that giving a seeming name to modest recipes was a general trick.
There was no cream foam, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and rabbit.
We swept our spoons into a thick brown cow.
Suddenly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe spoiled twice and third.
"German nuts would do better than this," Coe said to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Full reimbursement to Gilead for the legal fees of the C-hepatitis medicine patenttire with Merck
The judge of the United States Regional Court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive full compensation for the legal fees incurred by the C-hepatitis patent legal dispute with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million of damages, which had been imposed on him for violation of two Merck-owned patents in connection with the success medicines called the Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead.
In a complaint recorded on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the United States Regional Court said that Gilead was entitled to an exemption from the legal fees it was charged to defend the case.
Merck tries to reach Gilead, which manages the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can be treated by more than 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case runs until 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other’s justice and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance of the medicines of Gilead.
The U.S. troops have taken over the city of Manbij from Isis
The troops supported by the United States have taken over the city of Manjib, near the border of Turkey, in North Syria, when the last extremists of Isis were removed from the city, the reporter of the troops said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group now depressed the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
The representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharifan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages were released by Isis's fighters.
“The city is now fully in our possession, but we are still carrying out search operations,” Darwish said.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of the federal tax.
On Friday 2015 Hillary Clinton, the presidential candidate for Democrats, announced his tax declaration, which shows that his and his husband’s income was $10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate paid by them was 34.2.
In 2015, Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned almost 5.3 million dollars in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, who previously served as foreign minister, announced that he earned 3 million dollars at Simon & Schuster's book, which dealt with his term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton’s Vice President-President, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and his wife Anne Holton released 10 years of tax statements.
The actual federal tax rate paid by them in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to look like economic transparency," says Clinton’s campaign supporter Jennifer Palmier in their newsletter.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and cancels his promises to publish his tax information.
According to the US presidential candidates, they have always disclosed their tax information, even though the law does not require them.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the audit of the tax administration and said it was the reason Trump has not disclosed his income information.
"Siirto is yours", your twiitta Clinton campaign supporter Ian Sams, referring to the tax information of the Democratic Society.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Law Assistant Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not let Trump publish his tax information before the inspections were completed.
Trump’s critics, including Presidential candidate Mitt Romney of the Republicans of 2012, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump’s own capital, his grants to charity, business relations and many other ties to which relationships are also included in Russia.
Clinton has taken this question and published a video online on Friday in which he highlights the visible Republicans that expose Trump to publish his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and not to publicise his tax statements," Clinton said.
According to the Political Journal, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid just a little for two years in the 1990s, and New York Times’ business colonists quoted several tax agents and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be similar.
The federal tax rates have become the key issue of the presidential elections.
Clinton has been in favour of a rule named according to Warren Buffett, a billionaire investor that would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton Election Conference in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, the main office of the Berkshire Hathaway multinational company, challenged Trump’s meeting where both of them would reveal their tax information.
Buffet says that he has also been subject to the audit of the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax statements until 2007.
Clintons, now living in the city of Chappaqua in New York, paid the actual federal tax by an average of 32% between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton’s 2015 tax statement shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income were wages.
Their main investment was a low cost index investment fund, and Clintons announced the amount of dividends and interest income for $100,000.

Chili powder-filled chili condoms for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Natural Protectors in Tanzania have invented an unusual way to keep elephants away from the neighborhood of human housing – the elephants are thrown away by throwing chili powder filled condoms towards them.
The art has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation invented a few years ago has launched a campaign with the American Nature Conservancy to teach volunteers from Nordic villages how residents can protect their homes and crops without harming elephants.
A while ago, the elephants were used.
Friday is the world’s elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"We have seen the method of changing attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can rely on them to keep elephants away from their fields without harming them," Damian Bell, CEO of the Honeyguide Foundation, said.
First, the intrusive elephant is shaken by showing the flashlight and playing the storm.
If this doesn't work, we'll throw a chili cloud.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed in the condom together with a shiny one, and then the head of the condom is twisted in such a way that only the lighting wire remains outside.
When the electric wire is lighted, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine chili powder cloud to the air.
Usually one spice cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last way is the thrower that shoots the fireworks known as a Roman candle in the air and creates a loud and clear explosion.
The Jewish film director criticizes the Berlin hotel to remove the Israeli direction number from the "building" of the Arabs – RT News
The French, Jewish film director, gave birth to the media trail, as it was revealed that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel does not mention Israel’s headline number in its country list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on holocaust, frustrated the Berlin Kempinski Bristol by writing an open letter to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
In his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find the hotel in the list of directions offered by Israel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
“How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed—as if it does not exist?”
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation for the reception of the hotel.
Lanzmann writes the response of the receiver shocked him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was "a decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the measure was even more shocked by the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, “Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel’s direction number.”
Suddeutsche Zeitung interviewed by the German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman of Israel said the case was “a great shame.”
"The death shocks and shocks us all.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is when we consider that we are in Germany, and it is this hotel chain.
No more explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the Ambassador.
The case caused a fair counter-reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel simply gave up the claims of alleged Arab customers.
"Free" was said in a series of publications where the location of the hotel was presented near the synagogue on the Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes the charges against the hotel quickly, called it a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The order to leave Israel out of the list of directions has never been given," wrote Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski.
It adds that the direction number has been subsequently added to the list.
Police used tears gas and rubber pieces in demonstration of Brazilian students
Students joined the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered together to show their views against government reforms of the public education system.
The police used tears against protesters and rubber stores.
The melaccation began when law enforcement authorities tried to disperse the student’s team, resulting in the police using rubber stores and tears.
There were hundreds of students who wanted to show their atrocities with government plans.
Sao Paulo, Governor Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a saving measure in which nearly 100 public schools are closed and 300 000 students are placed in new schools.
Some protesters made graffites for walls where the presidential office was temporarily opposed to Michel Temer.
The demonstration of students took place only a few days after the streets were filled with dismissals of President Dilma Roussef's supportive protesters when the Senate of the country voted on the official charge.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
The annual trade exchange between Moscow and Teheran has increased by 70.9%, says the Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagarya.
He said the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were abolished.
"Russian companies continue to have existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Promoting trade is, of course, one of the priority objectives in cooperation between countries,” says Dzhagarya.
In the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and increased by $856 million.
Russia’s export to Iran quickly rose by 91.5 per cent, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to 158 million dollars.
The shop accelerated the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
Dzhagarya also expects a record of Iranian styrists to travel to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Delegation in Iran granted about 35,000 visas to Iran’s citizens, most of which were travel visas.
Iran was the first time among the first 20 countries to travel to Russia.
It is not too dare to say that the record of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes to change.
“I can personally recommend traveling to cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he says.
Skotti Callum Skinner would draw the British when winning the gold of bike
Callum Skinner of Scotland controversial team Prince Rio's velodrom last night, when the British three defended the 2012 championship in London.
Glasgow's 23-year-old Skinner was in the role of an anchor, which he inherited from his country man's Scottish Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made the legend proud to thank the goal and capture the victory from the New Zealand team.
The United Kingdom took a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after they were only sixth in the MM races in London, despite the fact that Hoy had later left his race.
The problem between Beijing and London was to replace Jamie Staff, who was specialized in the role of the first leader.
Hindes just came up at the right time.
The Hoy’s decision to terminate a race also left a hole that Kian Emad and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scotland Skinner was a man in which the British coachs believed and saw the potential he now redeemed.
Hindes, Hoy and Kenny won the championship four years ago, and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British triangle won gold in a double battle.
Hindes was steadily behind after his round, but Kenny worked on the team's leadership position, which Skinner maintained.
A large part of the change was changing the strategy in such a way that Hindes drove to slow down the speed with a greater shift, making Kenny and especially Skinner able to keep the speed.
Hoy followed the BBC as a commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes’ eyes when they entered the Prize.
Glasgow's 23-year-old Skinner says, "I'm flattered with breastfeeding.
I'm just trying to do my best and success.
We made an Olympic record at the final and won the world champions.
That was incredible.
There is no better way to win it."
After winning in London 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had fallen on the track due to a bad departure.
He later canceled his word and the British competitors did not have an appeal.
This time, there was no such problem with suverenity.
Hindes says: “It was like in London, all the UK tickets were in the yard.
Our team became united over the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that victory in the Olympics feel great.”
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven of ten ratamestars in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress in the last five months, five days of debtodrom will be successful.
As Kenny has demonstrated, it is impossible to imagine that he repeats Hoy’s achievements and wins three Olympic cultures in one of the Olympics.
This would mean decaying the account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and was born on 23 March (the magical date of British sport, also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farahi and Roger Bannister).
Medal aids would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will compete next in the sprint that begins today and ends in three days.
Bolton’s 28-year-old Kenny says, “I can only enjoy this right now.
The team race is always the best.
You can enjoy winning together with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely.”
Hindes says, “If he wins another two gold medals, he has to gain the value of the knight.”
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four men in the team.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record made in London 2012 and won gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (clock 22.42) are competing today on the second day of competition, and the focus of the attention is certainly Wiggins.
He had a dispute with competition journalists yesterday before the time run, when journalists invited him to measure his length.
In similar women’s competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavie’s Katie Archibald reached the world recording period 4:13.260.
The British team can now rely on its powerful track bike team to take responsibility for the mid-stage of the Olympics and bring a bunch of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional displays in Beijing and London, the expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
The background has had dramas, of which the least is Shane Sutton’s dissolution in April in the midst of sexual and temptation claims, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton’s competitors.
However, the first night of the competition with velodrom shows that the United Kingdom’s legendary reputation to get to the top is once more.
The future of the Portland melting plant at risk due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminum sewerage in Victoria, Portland, and therefore the workplace of thousands of workers is at stake when the electricity-generating power company told that one of the owners of the factory is dismantling the supply contract and is expected to terminate all supply contracts.
This is the result of the decision made by the Victorian Government in the past this year not to continue the support in which the factory is operated.
A fixed 20-year aid will cease in November.
Alcoan Portland’s factory is at risk of losing up to 2000 jobs.
As a result, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to increase, as the melting plant consumes about 10% of the total electricity production of Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting facility, resulting in which the Anglese power plant was closed last year.
Alcoa Portland's melting house loses money and is in danger of closing its doors.
Measures are equivalent to speculators used for years on the future of the factory, which were first caused by the price of the Australian strong dollar and recent factory production.
AGL, which delivers electricity to a large aluminum sewage plant from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says he expects that three other melter owners will also terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the factory is a joint company formed by Alcoa and Alumina. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares.
AGL says it expects Portland’s production facility to remain in operation, which means that physical electricity demand for melting continues.
AGL says the contracts are the so-called safeguard agreements that were to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period is 12 months, so it will expire in 2017.
“This is why AGL expects contracts to generate revenues in the financial year 2017,” says the power plant.
The potential impact on AGL from 2018 to 2018 is currently limited by the strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts with $187 million "preliminary termination of contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to keep the melting plant in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting facility".
The American company said he made a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was to enter into force since November of this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the weak economic situation of Alan, analysts have been careful about their assessments of both the melting plant in Victoria, Portland, and near the Tomago factory in Newcastle.
The AGL Operational Director Stephen Mikkelsen said in his speech to analysts last week that Portland used about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago used about 900 megawatts at the annual level.
“If these factories leave the market, it means a significant decrease in demand on the (electric) market.
As a producer, it would not be good news,” Mikkelsen said.
Kardashians TV star Kendall as a covergirl of September Vogue
The model of Kardashian-Jenner clan and his mother and manager of Kris' fourth daughter Kendall Jenner, 20, poseera in the famous September of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising face and appeared in Milan, Paris and New York's fashion tips, announced the news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking a hand in a room full of my dearest got me tears," Kendall wrote.
The publication of the file was followed by a strange (or perhaps just following the style of the Kardashianit series?), a handwritten video where all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (Bar Hägers Rob and Caitly and everyone's favorite uncle Ryan Seacrest) presented their sister's coverage. The video ends in a classic translation: they were all planning a surprise party for her sister.
The plot is cliched, and it is used in almost all the birthday periods of the session programs (Seacrest says, "Do you think we have forgotten you?" as sincerely as the drawing character of the children's morning TV), but Kris had to get the rest of his daughter in some way in this publicity.
For the presence of Vogue in September is definitely a new period of Kardashians.
Kendall’s sister, Kim, had a chance to get to Vogue’s lawsuit before (when Vogue was in the cover with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September number of the magazine is quite his own class.
The number of September is the most sold publication of Vogue in the year.
With its thickness a large picture book than a fashion magazine-like number attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site of Fashion decreased that last year’s 832-page guide had 615 pages of ads).
The publication of the September number is expected to be so urgent that the pictures of the magazine have leaked into the public already before the official announcement.
Previously on September, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss have been a cover model.
In recent years, the cover has more about the celebrities that work the model than models that are famous.
Oscar’s winner and Dior’s commercial face Jennifer Lawrence was in the cover in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga was honored.
The newspaper describes Jenner as a model of success of his generation, and even if he rather reads among the celebrities that work the model, he is in a fairly good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, true TV stars or modern children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even Jenner is all of them).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry over others.
Last year, Beyonce in the cover is behind one of the strongest years in her career, when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Due to their true TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be stubborn.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "narchs".
These emotions have resurfaced when the news of Jenner's presence on the Vogue deck came out.
Continuing inconsistency, however, feels insignificant.
Kendall Jenner is a cover picture model for Vogue September.
He is a super model, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking in Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
He's the advertising face of Estee Lauder makeup.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid applications.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he photographed on the LOVE magazine.
And at his free time, he will be on the true TV, perhaps just as a way to meet his sister and his children.
Legal Assistance Centres turn away 160,000 people a year
Every year more than 160,000 people in the most vulnerable countries will be reversed from legal aid centres, and the sector will prepare for the impact that additional budget cuts will already have on the centres operating at the borders.
In the Queensland state, free legal assistance and legal service seekers are reversed from five people already — most of them are old, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified suppressions, and similar injustices against people fighting without resources.
Public legal assistance services, whose workload has already been overloaded, prepare for additional cuts of appropriations.
As of June next year, legal assistance centres are at risk of losing 30% more of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Assistance Centre, says that the latest report by the National Organisation of Legal Assistance Centres, says that thousands of people will be reversed annually.
If the federal government fails to make its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s Public Legal Assistance Centres are constantly under-financed, meaning that thousands of people will be turned away when applying for the necessary services they need,” Farrell said.
“People who are indifferent, uncontrolled and depressing debt burdens, divorced families, unjustly dismissed workers – all have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are not able to get the help they need.
The federal government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of Queensland's weakest positions have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and the Senator of Queensland to George Brandis to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal assistance to the national medium level.
It is time to take into account the needs of public judicial assistance centres and their customers, and the government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was filed against the threat of the employee with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was filed after no action was expected to be taken after its leadership was told that the director of the campaign's North Carolina had threatened the employee with a gun while driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in the action brought by Vincent Bordini, the former software trainer of the state campaign on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte.
Bordini said he was waiting months for the situation to be handled internally before he realized that this would not happen.
Bordini says, in his claim, that the campaign director Earl Phillip "received the gun, put his right front finger on the trigger and weighed the pipe on Vincent's knee leg".
After submitting a complaint to the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini heard that at least four other persons had experienced the same with Phillip.
"Although the gun is not triggered, it causes damage," Bordini said.
Only two days after the presidential candidate of the Republicans caused a general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second additional section" – which are considered as a weapon owner and armed officers – can take action if his candidate Hillary Clinton wins the election and chooses judges.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media removed his word in context and Trump said he did not encourage violence.
Bordini demands compensation from the campaign for an indifference and from Phillip for assault, assault and mental suffering caused by them.
Hope Hicks, Trump's reporter, did not immediately respond to a message in which he was asked to comment.
Phillip was not targeted despite the companies.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB told Phillip recently left a campaign.
The call request submitted by Phillip’s consulting company, the Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
Donald Trump, Presidential candidate of the Republicans, has been in a controversial campaign.

UK needs to use the Olympic Spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being – not only in local communities and in London, but in the whole country.
This was the most interesting thing for me in Heathrow. As in London’s Olympics 2012, we made a huge contribution to the benefit of our whole nation and all our regions.
The Olympicians produced huge benefits for Stratford and East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only for local communities, we create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, eliminating youth unemployment in the surrounding areas of the airport.
As in London’s Olympics 2012, there are always people who think Heathrow’s expansion is too big.
As for the Olympics, I heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be in the eyes of the rest of the world in an embarrassing situation.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
But Heathrow always responds to every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than many.
Extending is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and increase the economy at 211 billion pounds, bringing knowledge and employment to the airport environment and to the United Kingdom as a whole.
We have a great team of Heathrow that has implemented and stayed in the budget with a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme, which included a T5 terminal, voted as the best air terminal in two consecutive years of the year, and a T2 terminal, built in the middle of the two world's fastest runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway with a private investment of £16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be a expansion of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for the expansion of Heathrow in order to guarantee the future of our trade and to create knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow's Government and former Commercial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Advertising in Cat Mouse
The attempts of companies earning their money from online advertising to distract advertising software have become a cat-hire game, says a company producing preventive programs.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook had announced on his own page to prevent advertising, Adblock Plus published a blog, where it told the users that they could update their blocking software filters and thus prevent social service advertisements.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that he would change the ad codes for its desktop website so that advertising prevention programs are harder to identify which parts of the page are advertisements.
But now Adblock tells me that he's figured out the new codes.
Adblock's reporter Ben Williams wrote in his blog article that "the kind of balling between the open source advertising community and the misleaders has been running since the ads were invented," and it is possible that Facebook will soon make his own repair movement again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has participated in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern advertisers have formed in the field.
Overall, about 200 million people use advertising prevention programs, says Pagefair and Adobe last year’s research. The figure has almost fourfolded since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users daily on mobile devices, and the share of mobile advertising is already 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to contribute to the misunderstanding of advertisement prevention programs in its desktop app, as the informant suggests that mobile advertising prevention programs do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagrams.
The revenues from Desktop advertisements are still sufficiently high, and therefore Facebook considered the contributions to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also told us that he would update the advertising tool for user settings to allow users to more control how advertisements are targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adblock’s new filters, as it also impedes the appearance of some normal Facebook writings.
“This is not a good experience for users, and we’re going to solve the problem,” said Facebook’s newsletter in your email release.
"Promotion prevention programs are clumsy and ineffective, and therefore we have invested in the development of user settings like advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertisements themselves."
She committed suicide by leaving under the cars on a Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for witnesses to help on the motorway for the first Thursday hours of an accident where the woman deliberately left under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vaud's canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
She did her despair by lying on the dark road, and she was hit by more cars, says Vaud's police when she told me.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and his attempt was to commit suicide.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many car drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter says in the Le Tribune de Geneve newspaper that criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step forward in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether there will be charges against the drivers involved in the accident.
Was it impossible to avoid a crash?
It's gonna be clear by the prosecutor," says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases that do not allow drivers to be considered responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, the person walked in the dark motorway and the court decided that the drivers can’t expect to run into a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police authority was released from the prosecution that had been brought against him after he encountered a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne in one of the nights of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had enjoyed a lot of alcohol and turned out on the road.
The court considered that the police, who was responding to the emergency call, were justified and that the man lying on the road was “experienced and unpredictable”.
On Thursday, some knowing about the accident in Morgese is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to the NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
The NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to explore the past of Venus with the same tools and algorithms as climate researchers use.
The model was designed to determine whether the circumstances in Venus were sometimes similar to that on the planet, although Venus is hot and waterless and its gas area is almost completely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations, the slow rotation speed of Venus is explained by its thick gas circle.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to the Earth, and it has still rotated slowly.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than in Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic variations to maintain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent more delicate.
"In the GISS model, Venus slowly spins and its day-to-day is almost two months at a time", GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio says in the press release.
This heats the surface and creates a rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like an umbrella and protects the surface from a large part of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average temperatures of the climate are even a few degrees lower than the current temperatures of the country.
With the help of the model, Venus’s story was created, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary researchers about its development.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans flushed, and the ultraviolet light burned steamed water.
In the hydrogen karate space, only a thick carbon dioxide-containing gas and a fatal greenhouse effect – i.e. Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus Climate Model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy abandons his place as coach of Avalanchen
Patrick Roy dismissed his duties on Thursday as a coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as Vice-President of the Society's ice hockey activities, appealing to the lack of impact on the team's decision-making.
The Vice President of Colorado/President Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the company would immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have completed my task as the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the vice-president of the company's ice hockey activity," said Roy, a 50-year-old.
“I’ve been thinking about how to improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vice-president of the coach and the company’s ice hockey activities must be fully at the same lines with the organization.
He must also have the power to speak in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic said.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we hope for him all the good for the future.”
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the year of the League for his first season as the head coach of Avalanche 2013-2014.
He led the company to 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost in Minnesota and has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in the period 2015-2016 and stayed five points away from Minnesota Wild when playing from another Wild Card site at the Western Conference.
The Hall of Fame painter Roy won four Stanley Cupia – two in Montreal Canadiens and two in Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and stop strike
The main negotiators tell the Nordic oil workers’ wage strikes to be interrupted when all parties participate in the new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which provides oil field services, has been held in strikes with drilling cars under the management of the Royal Dutch Shell company in the North Sea.
According to the joint statement of the Parties, "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they agreed to re-initiate the process in order to resolve the dispute."
From the beginning of the next week, we will have a number of day-to-day lasting meetings to address the problems of fresh aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activities, which they said was the first for more than 25 years, as a protest for potential 30% wage cuts.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group cuts the tariffs of its contractors operating in the North Sea this year by around 9%.
The company's tariff reduction is based on a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in the countries in 20114.
According to the company, additional cuts provide it with a mobility space necessary for it to cope with the downturn of the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut off thousands of employees and announced their plans to leave oil and gas drilling in up to 10 countries. This is how it aims to enhance its operations after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
The lower prices and the economic situation of crude oil, which results from the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in June, creates pressure on energy companies.
The Scottish Member, Dave Anderson, met the working leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest workouts experienced in the North Sea for the whole generation.
He said the North Sea is vital for the economy of the region.
"In the North Sea and the whole country, we need a economy that has a benefit for many and not just few," Anderson said.
The new North Sea projects are expected to spend less than $1.4 billion in 2016 when they have spent around $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Plejad Star Force
The latest task of Kepler astronomers has been to measure the speed of rotation of the stars, which has helped the astronomers to gather the most comprehensive list of the speeds of rotation of the stars belonging to the Plejad Star Force.
On the basis of the new information, astronomers are able to determine why stars belonging to the same astronomers rotate at different speeds and how circulars relate to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing the results with other Star Forces we learn more about the relationship between weight and age and even its solar history,” says researcher Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the University of Caltech infrared processing and analysis centre in Pasadena.
The Plejad Star Force is 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many stars of the Stars have been born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adulthood.
They are currently running faster than ever.
When the wheel speed is at the top of the adult stars, large amounts of star winds will be dispersed.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars when they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
When the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by tracking the time between identifiable starlights (which corresponds to sunlights).
The latest listed rotation speed data suggest that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers – larger rounds slower than smaller.
"We see from the "tance" of the Plejads that slowly rotating are typically larger, while the fastest rounders are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because the Plejad Star Force is so close, it works as an ideal space laboratory that allows the characteristics of the stars to be compared to the speeds of rotation.
"The Plejad Star Force offers a support pillar for the theoretical models dealing with the rotation of both younger and older stars," Rebull said.
We want a lot more information about how, when and why the stars slow down their spin speed and stop their dance.
Rebull and his colleagues will present their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Plejads in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
