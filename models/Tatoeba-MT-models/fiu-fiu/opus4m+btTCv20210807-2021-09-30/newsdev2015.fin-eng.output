Changes in corporate support policies - Province - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU corporate subsidies, the management of national corporate subsidies will also be concentrated on four living centres from mid-September.
The operation in Eastern Finland is responsible for the South Savo Ely Center in Mikkel.
In accordance with the new Company Support Act in early July, EU Structural Funds should no longer be allocated to large companies unless it is entirely new.
The subsidiaries of more than five thousand residents are also regarded as high respect.
Instead, investment in improving the conditions of the municipality’s business can continue to be granted EU support.
In Eastern Finland, the strength of the EU and national aid management unit will be about 30 people.
At least for now, they all continue to work in their current positions.
For example, the job of Kalevi Pölöse, Head of the Structure Fund Unit of the South Savo Ely Centre is in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is now trying to do in Ukraine
Russia works consistently, even if it doesn’t always look like it.
The Head of the Institute of the National Defence College Strategy, Lieutenant Colonel, dozen Torsti Siren, was not surprised by the contradictory Ukraine news Monday morning.
It's been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
In the second place, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia did not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other side, Ukraine says its parachute forces are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near Luhansk Airport, and that the tank department has received confirmations (see more here).
Lavrov demanded that Minsk’s negotiations make an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Russia denies its involvement and needs to get the outcome of the negotiations immediately so that they can get their established position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole story, Siren says.
This is the big pattern: suddenly we need to start negotiating and expressly so that Russia gets its own extract to the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
Finnair outsourcing cabin services to the Norwegian company, holidays people
Finnair starts to buy cabin services as a subcontracting from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement concerns the routes of Finnair in Hong Kong and Singapore, but it is expected to be extended later.
The outsourcing of two routes leads to a reduction of about a hundred working years in Finland, which is carried out at the first stage of vacations, the company reported in its communication.
In addition, some 80 Asian tenants will end at the time of outsourcing routes.
In June, Finnair told me that it was going to outsourc around 20 routes in the next two years.
Outdoors were ended when there was no agreement with staff on savings.
Externalisations are scheduled to start in the next year's January-March.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also be continued with other partners candidates.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nerve-related back pain, i.e. ischetic pain, for those who work hard.
The study of the health department followed firefighters for 13 years.
The connection of sleep disorders to the Iskiaski tree must be surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and durability of firemen, which is regularly tested, does not seem to protect from pain, says the research director, doctant Sirpa Lusa at the report of the Health Service.
The work of firefighters is irregular shifting work, where the shifts can go up to 24 hours.
According to the Health Service, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the surprising new causes of water damage?
Damaging easily to other apartments
Water vacuum prices Water vacuum is not always caused by leaking pipe or hana, reminds the hosting union specialist.
We have been contacted when the aquarium breach has caused water damage in the house company that is possible to ban the aquariums, says Marina Furuhjelm, the Law Expert of the Hosting Union.
Furuhjelm reminds us that only pipes and sewerages are not common causes of water damage, but today also more and more new machines such as ice fire machines have caused water leaks in the apartments.
Many people do not know that machines such as cleaning or washing machine should not be left on control.
The water shaft should also be kept closed when the machine is not on, as otherwise the pressure in the pipe can lead to water leak.
The resident may be deemed to have been insecured if these obligations have been neglected, where the liability of the damages is inhabited.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance can replace damages, depending on the terms and conditions of insurance.
If it can be shown that the resident has caused harm with carelessness, the liability of the person is at stake.
If the resident has turned off the shower on the floor mine, the negligence can often be proven because in these cases the water has flooded elsewhere and the maintenance man comes to the apartment where the resident is out.
Furuhjelm tells us that due to the generalisation of the floor mines, two floor mines have now been installed in many student apartments.
Water vacuum prices have also been caused by water beds, although not to the extent that they were more popular than before.
Even the dog’s water cup and the fall of home wine can become real water damage.
I also know the case in which there were many cats in the apartment that had pissed on the floors so that there were extensive damages, Furuhjelm says.
The principle of remedial liability always goes in the same way if the company’s corporate order does not provide otherwise.
The shareholder is responsible for repairing the surface material and damage to the structure of the house company and damage to other apartments.
Water vacuum prices easily cause damage to other apartments because the structure of concrete is very easily absorbed by water.
Furrakellm says the apartments’ patter leaks are particularly difficult because the batteries easily bleed into structures.
Water vacuum prices can now cause generalised air heat pumps that produce condensation water.
The water should lead to a fixed sewage or rainwater network, not just to the container.
The shareholder also has the responsibility to remove water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, the lawyer advises.
Furuhjelm advises that even though the rules of the household company do not require a fixed deletion of the washing machine, the insurance may have a condition for which compensation is not received for this reason.
You should be careful with your own home insurance terms.
However, I think that washing machines are irrelevant, for example, water removal pipes derived from the bath as a major risk of many damages.
I recommend that the removal waters are always driven firmly into the drainage pipe.
Snow and water removal on the balcony
Washing machine, dishwasher, etc. machine control, while on.
Closure of water hens (washing machine and dishwasher)
The cleaning of the floor is visible twice in half a year.
The recommendation is to firmly connect the removal water to the sewage.
Check the goats and their possible leak
Regular freezer melting
Do you have any experience in water damage?

FC Honka lost again and enlightened as a serial jumbo
In the sports park of Tapiola, two of the weakest teams were encountered on Sunday evening at the football gymnast of the Veikkausliiga.
In June, FC Honka hosted seven winning tubes of Vaasa Palloseura.
The VPS just won Honka in July.
On Sunday, meeting with the espoolais team became a good seam, as VPS returned to the profit score for a long time, reading 2-1.
The main coach of the Vacants, Olli Huttunen, complained of the inefficiency of his team before the game, but the mixed Honka defence facilitated the painting problems of VPS.
Gamely very nervous performance.
We didn’t get any longer attacks, we didn’t get a hold ball,” Huttunen evaluates their own performance.
During the first half of Honga’s cowboy Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played very uncertainly.
Both of the vase paints were born as a result of the loose gambling of the puppets.
The opening paint was seen only after five minutes of the game, when Steven Morrissey led Sebastian Strandvall's shot by the fooled Honka painter Walter Viitalan.
Displease the first half time.
By the field, the team did the opposite than was agreed before the game," Honga's chief coach Shefki Kuqi manasi.
After the initial explosion, the espoolans got their game together and rolled the ball in the attackhead.
Especially the middle field player Carlos Portela and Roni Porokara were eager to seek places of action, but the last solutions were almost repeatedly miserable.
The closest goal was Honga’s central fieldman Jussi Vasara, whose 20 metres of shots were slightly over the VPS painting.
VPS attacked effectively using their vikkel attackers and Honga’s confusing top pair.
At half an hour, the vasians made a 2-0 position, when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart reached two times.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good head of play at the opening stage and repeatedly created situations on the left side.
Stewart’s speed was too much for the espool defense throughout the game.
“In the middle of the day, if you lose, then you will be lost with honor,” Kuqi said.
In the second episode, the indifferent Honka sought a furious mining painting.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third company succeeded.
Yerai Vilaboa finished the paint in the middle of the punishment area.
After the Vilabo goal, Honga had half an hour to balance the match.
The Espoo team took more risks all the time, giving VPS a chance for dangerous attacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey got the most nuts with the Viila, but the Honka paintings kept the home team in the game.
At the end, Honka was a little tired, and he didn't get any extra paints.
With the loss, Honka swore the last time there were seven more matches left.
Journal: Putin threatens to conquer Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite loud in a telephone discussion with EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, said the Italian La Repubblica magazine.
Putin expressed his irritation about the European Union's plans to tighten sanctions against Russia.
If I want to, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica says Putin said.
According to the newspaper, Putin’s message to Barroso was this: it is not worth irritating Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave the Russian TV channel one an interview about the Ukraine crisis on Sunday night.
Putin said in the interview that he fully holds the conflict within Ukraine and urges the Kiev government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev about the fire of civilian objects in Eastern Ukraine.
Russia "can't watch next door", if people are shot to death from the nearest distance, Putin said.
Esko Roine acknowledges: The work of an actress destroyed the family
The hard work of the Concar actress and theatre was raised to recognize how the actor’s profession destroyed his first marriage.
Actor Esko Roine will meet for 70 years next Friday, but I think it is a true saying that age is just a number.
I don’t see any difference compared to a year ago or two years or ten years ago.
The spiritual puberty seems to continue, Esko Roine says.
Roine has been retired for years, but yet he's pushing the job for many men.
Sometimes it was a joke that there weren’t many plays in this country without Esko Roinetta.
Currently, Roine plays the Helsinki City Theatre How to succeed in business, in the Past of the Theatre of the Tampere Workers, and in the Quartet of the Tampere Committee Theatre.
Roine is also seen in the future Risto Räppääjä film.
KUVA: Reijo Hietanen
The Roine actress career didn't start promisingly.
I didn't fit a tierna boy in school.
40-50 years later, the teacher said the reason I was so bad.
Esko Roine wasn't weakened.
The choice of the career was clear, there was no choice.
It felt close and loved.
I was so busy in the field that I left school and went to the army volunteer only to get to the theatre school as quickly as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theatres and 300 TV shows, depending on how to calculate.
If things are calculated like the angels, that every part of the TV series is their own show, then there are over 600 TV stories.
I was three years in a new day that took three episodes a week.
In the second spring, I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments to autumn 2016
Esko's grandchildren Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are fully attacked and make the Tampere Workers' Theatre Still Essible roles as an anarchist monuments in the exhibition.
The little brother will be on the stage for years.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about this age.
I always have to take a small booking that I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
For years, they have also left their marks on the man.
The age won't be alone.
The knees are operated, the hip whistles and the arthritis is troubled, but when you don't let it get too disturbed, yes, in these heads, Esko Roine says.
Roine was known to the Tv public, including:
From the pirate radio, and a visa where he shared hundreds of marks with Antti Einieo.
It was Antti Einiö who shared the crops.
I tried to thirst that they were hundreds and not crops.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was an insignificant Lieutenant Rautatalio.
She became the favorite of Tampere police officers, at the facility when it happened to be the same in charge.
A policeman stopped the car on the street, took the window open and screamed to me, "This Rautakallio is great!"
Working Group Successful
Theatres of Roineen have remained in mind, for example.
The Helsinki City Theatre Producer and Master's Class, the death of the Tampere Workers' Theatre Trade Traveller and the long-day journey of the Tampere Theatre.
It is all about the fact that the presentations have been popular.
It's not my merit, it's my team.
There's been rimanalisms.
The role of Pekka Woodhead in the movie is one of those.
There are others.
The reason is that I have agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the result is not myself or the viewers satisfied.
You can't choose your own job as a rival actress.
It's just nice to do what's been told.
In addition to the theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the 80s, he held a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
It didn’t become anything when I tried to be a director of the Tampere Theatre, an actress, and then another restaurantist.
If I remember correctly, within a year, it turned out that they could not be matched in any way.
It was typical that when the show was over or over, and I had a chance to think about whether to put the sauna on, the restaurant became a call that there were your friends here who wished to see you after the show.
Memories for the birthday
On his birthday, Esko Roinee appears memories, as ghost writers Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some kind of twist they've created from the face-knowler's memory.
At the time, when I played in Zoom, I was called a face wrestler.
I didn't know the ones I knew.
The book has been made for years.
In time, Roine told me that no news bomb is allowed because he has not done anything so rash, or if it is, he will not tell me.
I made a little first sentence in the book.
I'm saying that if someone is waiting for scandalous statements or good rumors, you should stop reading this.
A lot of professions are involved, so as an actress as a theater leader.
The publisher finds that there is also a turin of the hilarious theatre school.
It was quite a normal student life, but it was a kid who did all kinds of tricks.
It wasn't as bad as Turk's time.
It was very different.
I don't know how much more I got from there than self-confidence that when the school has been gone, you know that it's not close to it if it doesn't improve.
I didn't have to think how good I would be if I had gone to school.
Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.
I was friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Man and Hannes Häyris, and I was able to work with them.
There were legends from my first helper since Karlo Halttus.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palao was already gone, but I had time to meet him during school.
The middle son of the fire, Martti, was in the same course with me.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttu.
As a matter of fact, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in a way that the daughter went to my mother and son.
I didn’t think it was a good solution, and I think children are quite agreeing now as adults.
It is not rare in the theatre circles that the silver is divided.
In my case, there was some part of me that I worked a lot at the time.
I was in the theater almost every case.
Then there was a TV and a radio on it.
I did a long day and family life suffered.
A party day, maybe a free night
Esko Roine celebrates the Theatre of Tampere Workers on September 7.
The party will continue at the Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
The despair of his mind is there too.
I was fifty-year-olds at work and 60-year-olds at work.
When such an easy-to-moved play happened, I thought it would be going to be seventy years old, then we would get them off with one rhythm.
It says there are no holidays on the real birthday.
I think it's free night, but I'm not going to swear.
I might have put a job on that day.
Or it's a strange night I'm going to take off tonight, Roine says.
Aeronautical companies are concerned about the production chain
Some of the UK’s smaller aircraft manufacturers are concerned that the supply chain’s production capacity problems may degrade the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In the UK, thousands of companies belonging to the production chain of aeroplanes are currently enjoying the unexpected number of simultaneous aircraft and engine development plans.
Aviation and defence
While some people enjoy ordering, there are warnings about capacity problems and price pressure in the production chain.
“It is quite true that there is a price pressure, especially now that the production volume is challenging,” says Craig Gallagher, CEO of the main suppliers of aircraft manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, the CEO of the North West Aerospace Alliance, representing the supplier of North West Aerospace Production in northwest England, requires more capacity.
“Do strategies and investment plans respond to these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure about that.
In particular, we need more investment in new production equipment and machinery needed to enable these production volumes to be realised," Gallagher says.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in the building of aircraft is part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchilli, CEO JJ Chrurchilli’s gas turbines wings, the company is behind a "standing time" when several new construction plans were launched at the same time at the beginning of the year.
We went from a very small production to a space where production capacity exceeded.
Many orders were paid only afterwards, and in addition we had to try to move forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £80,000 in new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
Several operators in the sector believe that investing and co-ordination of small suppliers is needed if the United Kingdom wants to maintain its position as the second largest aeronautical operator after the United States.
Ford Aerospace, Chairman of the Ford Aerospace company and engineer for fine mechanical engineering from Tynes, says that the order should increase the confidence of producers and the desire to expand and increase production capacity, as the work will be sufficient.
“If this doesn’t happen, we will lose in competition against other countries,” Ford says.
Some major operators are trying to solve the problem by purchasing capacity.
The FTSE 250 aircraft and engine noise company Senior purchased UPECA 75 million pounds of parts of the aircraft operating in Malaysia.
MB Aerospace purchased companies from North America and Poland last year.
“It is possible to buy new start-up companies, but in reality, the most slowing production is limited to design and the number of engineers,” says Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has moved to them from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of the production chain are exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, CEO of the GKN aircraft production unit, who also operates the UK aeronautical trade company, believes that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
The supply chain has pressure, but I would not describe the situation as critical.
“The more important is the introduction of new technology and advanced processes,” Bryson says.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from errors and are now more cautious in order not to increase the number of buildings too quickly.
When Boeing attempted to increase its production in 1997, it was faced with major difficulties when the company made losses and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, director of Rolls Royce's aircraft production unit, says that the company has not yet encountered problems in the production chain, which delivers most of the 18,000 parts of the engine required for the manufacture of a shower.
“You will certainly be a bully, but we believe that we have worked more thoroughly on the supply chain by choosing the best partners and keeping in touch with journalists when preparing to increase their activity,” Wood says.
According to Boeing’s CEO James McNerney, the company’s production chain has had time to prepare for the increase in supply volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have acted openly for journalists, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of Airbus Airbus Airbus Airbus Airbus Supplier, says that the company will do its best to reduce the risks related to its plans to increase the production of A350 to 10 machines in a month by 2018.
“Even if one of the suppliers fails, and our job is to try to prevent this situation and support suppliers and seek alternatives, but it is to wait for major problems,” Brégier says.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for sins: “The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the main supplier.
“This is my work as well as Airbus’ work.”
Hong Kong's demonstration groups begin the "Central Independence Age" in Beijing, denying open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Democratic activists spread to the Hong Kong streets after China has abandoned their open elections.
The Hong Kong Democracy Groups emphasise that demonstrations can be stamped and sworn to ensure that the city begins the "Central Independence" era to oppose the reforms proposed by the Chinese government.
Thousands of protesters threatened the rainfalling rain against Hong Kong’s glorious horizon, when they were walking towards the democracy-winning Occupy Central group to organize a demonstration in front of the Council premises responsible for the implementation of the laws on Sunday night, where protesters urged people to participate in a large-scale session demonstration to disrupt the city’s financial block.
The opinion took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it would deny the right of voters to propose publicly candidates in the Mayor elections in 2017, despite such a number of months of demonstrations, which would further increase the city's disruption.
At the beginning of the demonstration of the Occupy Central movement in front of the central government buildings in Hong Kong.
“We want fair and decent elections,” says 24-year-old website manager Dion Tse, who attended a Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-yin.
The government does not respect the voice of Hong Kong.
We want the government to listen to us and see the decision-making of Hong Kongers.
The Chinese National Congress of the High Laws adopted plans for changes in elections, allowing only two three candidates to participate in Hong Kong's first direct elections.
However, the candidate is required to approve the 1200-person nomination committee, and opponent politicians consider this to effectively prevent the access of the electoral flags of different political opinions.
The demonstrators participate in the protest of Occupy Central Love and Peace, which was held in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong Government Building.
According to the police, more than 2,600 people were currently involved in the demonstration.
A large number of police officers followed when about 100 protesters led by the Scholarism Student Group were gathered late on Sunday to Grand Hyatt, where Li Fein, a member of the Communist Party, was supposed to stay after he arrived in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, participated in the press conference, including the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
Or not to comply with the law, however, to say the exact date when the blocking of roads is carried out, he urged participants to follow the situation closely over the next few weeks, adding that the city is formally moving to the "Central Independence era".
Benny or answer the press questions.
"Look at the person next to you," he said in the Sunday demonstration, in front of two characters representing disobedience in China.
That man has power in the center with you!
17-year-old conveniences representing Scholarism, Joshua Wong previously said that the preparations for the demonstrations of high school students are underway and are designed to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to show their mind by refusing teaching.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility," Wong says.
In Beijing, Vice-President Li Fei of the Committee of the People's Congress told journalists that the defence of public voting rights "International Requirements" is "time-lossing" and from some Hong Kong politicians who seek to "make society and mislead it".
"The unpractical proposals such as the appointment of a public candidate have wasted a lot of time," Li says, demanding that the method of electoralisation should be created in such a way that it is suitable for the real situation of each society and for the legislative framework.
The general voting law initiative can only be adopted as a law if a large majority, i.e. two-thirds of Hong Kong's 70-century legislative body supports it, which means that 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong might be drawn into a long-term political debate if the proposal for a reform is rejected by veto law.
“It would harm business and city development,” he says.
Approximately 800 000 people voted in an informal survey organised by Occupy Central in June to oppose China's demands, according to the requirements, the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
Up to 172,000 people marched on behalf of democracy on July 1st, while the marshal held on 17 August in favour of Beijing and Occupy Central, attracted around 88,000 participants. The estimates of the figures come from the University of Hong Kong, although the assessments of police and organisers differ significantly from these figures.
Three injured lightning attacks on the New York Beach
In a flash blow, a New York swimming beach led to three people injured.
According to the fire department, men were injured on the Orchard Beach beach at the Pelham Bay in Bronx on Sunday night when the hard storms crossed the area.
The injured men are in hospital.
The extent of injury is unknown.
The lightning hit when the severe thunderstorms were swept over the city.
Storm rains, thickness and lightning interrupted the Labor Day weekend and the U.S. Open tennis in Queens, and forced the music festival to close early on East River Island.
Ten commercial flights to airports in the city were delayed due to poor weather.
The new idea is not to be pleasant
This is the latest guide of network users to employees and supervisors, and it is shared by Harvey Schachter, author of Monday Morning Manager.
According to Seth Godin, a good idea is to identify comments like "I don't like it" or "I don't understand".
Unless so, the idea is likely to be popular and self-evident – i.e. boring and everyday – or the benefits it brings are so small that they should not be pursued.
As a historian researcher, Harvard Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people wouldn’t think that he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as director of the university, he repeats the same thing several times so that the message would go widely.
Advisor Bob Hoffman believes that TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people read news about the network does not mean that the internet would be good between advertising – just like the first phone was a popular communication tool, but a bad alternative to advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson says that there is one word to motivate workers: together.
In a study, participants were told that they would solve the problem as a co-operation, although in fact they worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solve more problems than those who were not told about cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a repeated pattern or relationship between two units, the performing expert Dave Paradi advises to forget Microsoft SmartArt and instead use a Diagrammer.com program that can choose between 14 different relationships.
Mount Stuart's curtain surgery banning due to safety risk
The specialist has been temporarily separated from his office, and the UK National Health System NHS ceased to direct patients to the mining surgery in this private hospital after the hospital problems were raised.
Two people went to Torbay's hospital after their emergency treatment at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The hospital of Torbay in Devon has said he was in contact with the 19 patients who were treated on July 26 and invited them to "smart clinical research".
The Mount Stuart hospital regretted it and said that it was started to study after the doctor was separated.
The case came to the Torbay hospital when two patients treated in Mount Stuart were looking for its emergency for eye problems.
According to Torbay’s hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all studied on the same day did not need a repair surgery.
The Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Hospital have not been directed by patients to treat Mount Stuart after the emergence of problems.
The temporary director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, head of the Torbay Hospital, David Sinclair, said that “we have identified the problem in its early stage and we were able to contact all patients concerned quickly.
Every time we direct patients to treat the service provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its authorisations are in order.
According to Gill Gant, “the patient safety is always in absolute number one, so it is important that these mining cuts are not carried out until we can completely be sure that the treatment is safe.”
The Ramsay Health Care UK company, managing Mount Stuart Hospital, asked for “excusefully for all patients with complications.”
The company was reported that “the week when we got to know about the potential problem, we later called from Torbay’s hospital to all patients concerned.”
This specialist has been licensed by Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been registered as a doctor since 1989.
By this day, he has conducted 4 537 mining cuts in different parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of the cuts he performed have been excellent and the complication rate has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been temporarily separated from his office until the case has been investigated.
What is "4chan"?
A bad anonymous communication site released first celebrity leaked naked images
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the hacker’s first option when he published stolen images?
"4chan" was founded in 2003. It has raised the debate on the communication site, which is searched as much as it is praised.
The site is divided into several parts, such as anonymous users can discuss all possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other online forums, users do not create one, constantly used profile and their publications are not stored.
With the most popular notification tables, comments may disappear in less than a minute when the latest publications remove them from the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprising creativity to 4chan.
Anonymous members of the community have created some of the most famous memories in the network (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of rules on the site has also led to a lot of questioning or direct criminal content on the site.
The website's most popular noticeboard is /b/, intended for mixed discussions and for which NSFW content is regularly published (Not Safe For Work).
This may include summer porn, but also brutal and shocking images. Anonymous hacker published the public stolen images specifically on this posting table on the weekend.
American CytRx invests in anticancer research and development
The aim of the CytRx company is to improve cancer – or at least slow it down.
The company producing biological drugs in Los Angeles, which recently became targeted by the product of the stock sales, is specialized in research and development of cancer medicines.
The most promising medicine is aldoxorubicin, a more advanced form of doxorubicin in general use of chemotherapy.
CytRx conducts clinical studies in the treatment of aldoxorubicin soft tissue arcoma, Aids-related capos sarcoma and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumours.
It is like a controlled missile that passes directly into the tumor and not into the rest of the body, says Steven Kriegsma’s anticancer medicine from aldoxorubics, CEO of the CytRx company.
My aldoxorubicin contains so-called combination technology that works as a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to protein in the blood, which also accumulates into tumors, where the drug passes directly to cancer cells.
I donated the drug only in a acidic environment, i.e. cancer cells, but not in a healthy tissue.
This technology allows patients to receive more and more doses of cancer.
“It is like a missile that passes directly into the tumor and not another body,” says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of the CytRx company.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on the development of drugs, CytRx does not make profits.
This year, the company sold shares and collected 86 million dollars for maintaining and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide for a crucial 3-step clinical study of alternative treatment of soft tissue spam.
The soft tissue cloth is a type of cancer that develops in soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fat tissues.
Alternative treatment is used to treat cancer when the initial treatment does not lead to results.
If the clinical study is successful, CytRx plans to apply for a drug authorisation from the US food and medicine management industry already in 2016, Kriegsman says.
The drug could then be adopted in 2017.
The analysts say that the data published in December in the previous clinical study of CytRx showed that aldoxorubicin is a promising treatment for soft tissue cloth.
“We haven’t seen any clinical information about how much it differs from the drug itself,” says H. C. Wainwright & Co. Investing Analyst Andrew Fein.
The publication of the results confirmed many opinions that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says it is difficult to predict the results and timetable of the current clinical study, as it differs significantly from the previous study that has obtained good results.
"Some things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares the development of medicines to the mining industry.
“At first, there is a lot of money to find that one golden vein, and it continues to be so long as that golden vein can be found,” he says.
Money will be spent in research and development for so long that the drug is able to trade.
Several shareholders have demanded the CytRx company to court because they believe it gave a better picture of their success.
In the complaints, the company is accused of hiring a DreamTeam Group that then hired people to write positive comments about the CytRx company and the other biotechnical company in Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fol and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the complaints, the articles did not reveal that the companies paid fees to the authors.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that he had deleted the articles “which were against practice”.
A number of companies were also deleted from other sites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the accusations.
The company has hired an external lawyer to answer the complaints.
“I don’t have time and energy to focus on this,” Kriegsman says.
He said that the real challenge of CytRx is to find talented workers who tend to work in biotechnology centres like San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
“This is in many ways wilderness from the pharmaceutical industry,” he says.
Views of the Analyst magazine
The price of the shares of the CytRx company rose to $8.08 on January 10, and then fell to less than $3 in April when the charges for advertising of the shares came to the public.
According to the Analyst magazine, claims and negative publicity have lowered the price of shares than their actual value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure if there's any easy way to miss this thing as long as the idea is in force."
In the name of the law, the cameraman of the police series was killed in the middle of the descriptions
The photographer of a series of real events in the name of the Law in Finland died Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of the shooting incident.
The cameraman photographed a shooting between the suspected person who had been hit by the bullets of the police department and the fast-food restaurant.
He died quickly injuries.
According to the TMZ site, the police reported that a person suspected of armed robbery died in the shooting incident in addition to the cameraman.
The first series of real-TV programs in the name of the Law has been presented in the United States since 1989.
The series has been presented in Finland on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The issue of an external factor will become a crucial role in the court proceedings that began the death of Ulvila today.
Anneli Auer is accused of the murder of his husband Jukka S. Lahde in 2006.
The Court of Justice of Vaasa now deals with the case for another time, as the Supreme Court returned it to the Court of Justice with a new evidence.
The court’s purpose is that the judgment is still given on the side of this year.
The Court of Justice of Vaasa released Auer in 2011.
At that time, the court considered the possibility of an external author to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening speech, prosecutor Kalle Kulmala told the prosecutor's view of the murder and of the facts that exclude the possibility of an external author.
In our opinion, the crucial question is whether an external factor has come into the house that has killed Jukka Lahden in the way and in time.
It's about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, the Church began a family dispute during which Auer had announced to leave his home and to apply for divorce.
At some point, they moved to the kitchen where Lahti was stuck with Auer and tried to prevent it from leaving.
One of them took a kitchen knife," Kulmala described the events of the night of death on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, a number of factors prove that there was no external factor.
For example, the emergency call recording does not contain any voices from an external author.
The oldest child of Auer, the daughter, told me in the interrogation, he saw the author when he left the door of the fireplace.
The 2011 release judgment of the Court of Justice of Vaasa was partly based on the story of the daughter.
According to the prosecutor, the finding of the daughter cannot be correct.
“The daughter did not see an external author in the parent’s bedroom, even though she went there twice,” Kulmala said.
The new witness of the prosecutor is just related to the possibility of an external author.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has told me about the events since the night of the murder in the hospital.
She said she only told me in the hospital that she only saw Lahde's body when she went to the fireplace.
Auer's defense is going to introduce to the court investigation lines, which have not been sufficiently determined by the defence of the police.
When Vaasa’s court was released three years ago from Auer’s prosecution, the right to find a foreign man’s DNA as one of the references to an external author.
The sample later turned out to be a researcher in the Central Criminal Police Laboratory.
It was then taken as a mass sample of 700 people with a DNA sample.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were closed,” said Defense Attorney Juha Manner.
One of the new witnesses of the defense tells about an external factor.
The Ulvil woman told the police about a porn man who had confessed the act according to the woman.
The police interviewed the man in the summer.
The prosecutor decided that a civilian had nothing to do with a crime.
The prosecutor filed an investigation request for a woman, as the prosecutor suspects the woman who lied to her report.
One of the new witnesses of the defense is a nurse who worked during the night of the death at the central satakunta hospital.
The tribunal condemned Auer's lifelong prison sentence for murder last December.
According to the Court of Appeal, the possibility of an external author was fought against, among other things, Auer’s children’s reports, the external author missing from the Emergency Center records, and the time required for the operation of the events.
The court came to vote 2-1.
The lesser judge wrote that contradictory evidence in the criminal case must be interpreted as the benefit of the defendant.
Therefore, the daughter’s report must be interpreted in such a way that, despite the contradictions of the report, it had found an external author leaving the door of the fireplace.
Auer's two oldest children have been called court hearing.
The daughter was first personally consulted last year in the Satakunta's court of executives.
In court, he no longer remembered the night of the murder.
Auer's second oldest child named her mother's killer in the video interview in 2011.
The boy told me he heard the incidents of the night of the murder behind the closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to kill for six months.
As a lawyer, the boy has no obligation to say anything in court.
The court proceedings will continue today by consulting Anneli Aure.
The hearing of Auer will continue, if necessary, tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently sitting for more than seven years in prison for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to participate in the G20 meeting?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him the first enemy.
Putin is to take part in the G20 Summit in Brisbane in November, and in Australia, it is tough to discuss whether or not his entry should be allowed.
The Punkrock activist group, Pussy Riot, asked Australia to deny Putin's participation in the summit, with more than 4,000 representatives from the most influential countries in the world.
“This person does not have anything to do with the G20 meeting,” Maria Alyokhina said to the public in the event of the Festival of Dangerous Ideas in Sydney’s full-packed opera house.
Kiova has warned her to be on the "full war" side, and Putin calls parts from Ukraine to "Novorossia" or "new Russia". Is it necessary to welcome her?
Tony Abbott said he's going to make a decision.
According to Mike Callaghan, head of the Lowy Institute Research Center G20, Australians cannot decide who participates in the meeting, even if the meeting is held in the country.
"Austral can decide who it lets down, but it is an international meeting," he says.
Just like when New York hosts UN meetings or Washington hosts meetings of the International Monetary Fund, “the host’s task is not to deny someone invited to come,” Callaghan says.
In the last week, Tony Abbott said that he would "reason a decision" after Russia's disastrous actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
Since Putin is coming to a very significant international meeting, Australia does not have the right to decide alone.
"But this is an important thing I will consider a lot, and I believe that other countries will do so in the coming weeks," he said.
People participate in an anti-war meeting in Mariupolis, Eastern Ukraine.
The event lasts for two days, and has a wide range of representatives from the world's largest and most rapidly developing economies, with around two-thirds of the world's people who represent 85% of the world's GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as a number of non-commercial G20 countries, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia had a questioning role to balance between different interests under high public pressure.
In his view, the best way to handle the matter is to use the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we will take advantage of this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will require President Putin to make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to explain his actions,” Callaghan says.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressure.
I think the world expects them to talk about these things.
The Russian-minded rebels prepare weapons for the attack on Ukraine's bases at Donetsk Airport in Eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether to attend Puti's meeting, and Callaghan says this is not known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He hardly notes that “I have to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November”.
The opponent leader Bill Shorten takes Putin to Australia as a "specially reserved" but understands that it is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other countries and G20 countries whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
It is an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand it.
After the tragic events followed by Malaysia Airlines, as well as in the absence of a proper cooperative capacity for pity, responsibility and air accident, and now that thousands of Russian soldiers are on the border of Ukraine, I believe that most Australians are highly booked to welcome Putin to Australia.
The German business world criticizes "self-dependence" Berlin
Some of the German top business leaders warn that Germany has become "reliable" and "secret" because government policy threatens the competitiveness achieved by the country.
The criticism of the federal counterpart Angela Merkel government happens at the same time as the largest European economy shows signs of slowing down, which causes concern whether it is able to rotate economic growth in the euro area that is on its own.
The criticism of corporate leaders is the result of the strongly opposed political decisions of the German business sector, including the introduction of minimum wages and the calculation of the retirement age of certain long-term workers.
“I think the biggest threat right now is excessive trust in Germany, which inevitably causes the feeling of self-dependence,” says Kurt Bock, the world’s largest chemical manufacturer.
EU Economy
He thinks that, "Growly, we have the feeling that we are doing well, we have money to use and unemployment at a relatively low level.
I think there is a great danger here.
The German government’s policy shows that we are not focusing on growth and are not favourable to environmental companies, but instead we are focusing much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of some.
According to Markus Kerber, the CEO of the German Industrial Organization BDI, "The situation in Germany is good now.
However, every developed economy has to change over the next ten years. ...[in Germany] the reform programme does not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
German unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced. Even once again, the slow consumption is growing.
However, GDP declined in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of export profitable Germany for external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP decreased by 0.2% over the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
The weak performance of Germany threatens to make the ECB’s fight against low inflation more difficult and may make it more likely for quantitative recovery.
Kerber would like the government to "return from public consumption to public investment", for example by focusing on future increases in consumption to infrastructure and not even pensions.
Kerber believes that Merkel’s government will destroy its social democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder’s fruits in the early 2000s with strict politics.
Stiftung Familienunternehmen, CEO Stefan Heidbreder, established for family businesses, said: "The situation in Germany is still good compared to other countries.
It is thanks to companies and not to government policies.
The French example of the neighbouring country has shown that the use of funds for social assistance and the restriction of the freedom of management of the company is the wrong way of action.
The leading German investment banker described the situation more clearly, saying that the government’s recent decisions are “a disaster”.
Germany threatens to lose all that it has done so much work, just to please voters.
This is my main concern right now," says the banker.
According to Bock, the new government coalition energy reforms failed to solve the fundamental weaknesses of policy that have caused the cost of reducing competitiveness to the industry.
Ashton Kutcher with music festivals after preventing access to the fan
Actor Ashton Kutcher participated in Stagecoach Cantrimusic Festivals in Indio, California, where he is reported to have fought with a strict security officer.
Ashton Kutcher is reported to have fought with a security guard at a cantrimusic festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him at the backstage at the Stagecoach Cantrix Festivals in California, after which the situation was robbed from the hands, the TMZ website says.
Kutcher was in VIP, when a young woman approached him to greet and hand her.
When the Star of the Men's Series went to greet the fan, the super-inspired guard intervened and caused the sluggish.
The actress and the security officer went into the armchair, and Kutcher's friends had to intervene in order to arrest Kutcher, TMZ says.
After divorce from his ex-wife Demi Mooresta Kutcher is dating Mila Kunisia, like Kutcher, the stars of the former 70s show.
Nujakka happened shortly after Angus T. Jones was practically removed from a hit series standard actress card after he published a video in which he calls the series "rocket" and urges fans not to watch it.

The Baltic Sea Bacterial Killed a Holidayer
The bacteria that originated from Caribbean in the popular German tourist destination have been ill for six people.
One of the patients is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is met in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but mostly found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria spread most effectively in more than 20 degrees of fracture waters.
"The bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are correct," Dr. Heiko Will, Director of the Health and Safety Agency of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, said to The Local.
The bacteria are found in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGuS, the sick had been on vacation on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
He died in the beginning of August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his leg should be amputated.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoop with a small wound on his leg.
The sick went to the hospital after he noticed on his way home that his leg has become blue.
Doctors found blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus.
“My husband would not have spent time in the Baltic Sea, if he knew about the danger,” said the sick wife Sonja Bruehl to Ostsee Zeitung.
Serious disease and damage caused by blood poisoning to the patient and this family could have been avoided if information had been better available. For example, the form could have been able to draw up a notice.
LAGuS told the dpa news agency that doctors have been advised of the next infection at the beginning of the summer, but no official notification was given.
Cool temperatures have led to a lower risk of bacterial disease.
"The results of the test showed that the strain of the V. vulnificus has decreased significantly," says Dr. Will.
The cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of cholera-inducing bacteria, is particularly dangerous if a person has chronic liver disease and impaired immune responses such as HIV or diabetes and elderly people.
The risk of male disease is greater than women, as the estrogen has been observed to protect against pathogens.
If you get sick of the bacteria, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
The likelihood of a bacterial death in the wound disease is about 25%.
The V. vulnificus can also be ill by eating seafoods that it is contaminated, although Dr. Will says in these cases it is not this infection.
Containing foods from the sea is more common in the southern half of the ball.
In Germany, the V. vulnificus bacteria caused poisonings for the last time in 2010, when two people died there.
Vieno Kekkonen: Breast was removed due to cancer suspicion
The 80-year-old singer Vieno Kekkonen works and fits hard, but has also been afraid of his health.
It is incredible that the radiant Vieno Kekkonen has been filling for 80 years.
He’s amazed at how these ages can suddenly be so much.
I didn't realize I was so old.
80 years sounds so much, Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
Vieno Kekkonen spends his birthday with his family.
At the end of August, a birthday party was held by a folk music and pensioner union in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on the stage of Kekkola, in the same place where my grandfather was born.
I was so obsessed with the celebration, the birthday hero tells about the event where the three hundred-dollar stages were full of congratulations.
A couple of days later, the Mechanism gathered to greet Armi Kuuselaa, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers when he was young.
And now we're both this age!
Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
During its long career there are only few sides that Vieno Kekkos has not been seen in the public.
One thing he has never spoken publicly before: 2006 he was removed from another chest.
My chest was unclear at a point that it was decided to completely remove it.
It wasn’t, of course, cancer from which I was happy.
In the same surgery, a new chest was made, so it was quite a big operation.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought that he lost his own chest in a way in vain, because the knowledge of the unambiguous finding would have been difficult to carry and cannot be left untreated.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen told and pointed out that the loss of your own breast to younger people will certainly be more difficult.

The farmer is made guilty of the sea.
The debate on the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its connection to Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The voice of experts has been demolished in politically intended opinions.
In particular, the Helsingin Sanomat and Yle have been stretching agriculture’s responsibility for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea during the summer.
There is a need for rapid action to control emissions in the same way.
The average farmer affects a few environmental researchers and their help in comparison with relevant suppliers from a superior nutrition expert.
The farmer knows that nutrients cannot come from cultivation if the crop has been sown with the same amount of nutrients as the harvest is repaired.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilizers and requires accurate monitoring and reporting of the nutrient balance.
The authorities shall monitor compliance with the conditions.
Nutrients stored in the pellets have also been rinsed in waters after fertilizer restrictions, but this has also been seen for years.
Farmers have the desire and capacity to continue to work to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that access to the zero level is impossible.
“If we want to have a approximately amount of agricultural production equivalent to consumption, it is only acceptable that this is the case,” says Jyrki Battery Director of the MTT Environmental Research (MT 29.8.).
The last summer came to the Gulf of Finland to measure blue populations.
The researchers were quite unanimous about the fact that the rest received its growth power from the sea’s own phosphorus stocks.
The phosphorus stored on the bottom of the sea is partly a decoupling from the farming of the past decades of the coastal states, but it alone does not explain stocks.
The cleaning of urban wastewaters growing in the Baltic Sea coasts was on the back until the end of the 19th century.
The problem was also related to the waste waters of Great Helsinki and they were not seen as a problem as the pollution of their own beaches.
The pollution of the beaches was prevented by building a waste water pipe on the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of water controlled there has been improved over the years.
Nutrients ended up in the sea will not leave it even if agriculture would be completely discontinued from Finland.
However, every summer blue-blue debate and the accusations presented are always against agriculture today.
The public debate marks the farmer guilty of the Baltic Sea.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it becomes increasingly difficult when it is used to implement political passion.
The Greens will lead their President, Minister of the Environment Ville Niinistel to major changes in the environmental standards of agriculture.
As an explosion board, Niinistö has used the summer rest discussion.
The societies have accused the producers of the MTK of old-fashioned stocks and considered it the most difficult barrier to water protection.
There should also be a political rhetoric.
Most specific projects for water protection are based specifically on cooperation between MTK, farmers and environmental administration.
The aggressive style of societies serves more to fish for urban sounds than to protect waters.
I think that's the point.
With hard speeches, greens prepare to leave the government.
In policy changes, the MTK is responsible for ensuring the performance of its members.
It is difficult to trade expensive changes for farmers unless a substitute is found for their costs.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has made is the cuts from other agricultural funds.
Abolition of mining tax is not going through: Palmer
The latest attempt by the Abbot government to throw a mining tax on the trash basket seems to be destroyed, because Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without any changes.
The Australian Labour Party also fears that the government has included in a new initiative a rule that could limit employers' increases to compulsory pension payments up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in the House's subroom on Monday to accelerate the revocation process in the power of general confusion and the Labour Party's clear depression.
It put the original revocation initiative on which the Senate had previously made significant changes and replaced the new legislative proposal, which it described, above all, relates to taxes, pension payments, social security and family social assistance.
Initially, it was an initiative to revoke the "unsuccessful" mining tax and other decisions, such as low-income pension fees (3.6 billion savings), earnings premium (1.3 billion dollars) and the bonus paid for school-age children (4.7 billion dollars).
Clive Palmer, Director of the Palmer United Party (PUP), did not accept the transfer of the government.
"A well-designed mining tax will not be accepted in the Senate without a low-income pension, a bonus on earnings and a bonus on school-age children," he twittad.
The government needs support for independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Minister of Finance, Chris Bowen, accused the government of attempting to remove Parliament's power to decide on the mandatory amount of pension payments, giving the Minister of Finance all the powers of decision.
"This is unprecedented," he said to journalists in Canberra.
In this way, the government could delay other increases, which would lead to the 12% goal of the pension guarantee for the Labour Party up to 2034.
“It’s unacceptable, and the Labour Party will, of course, oppose it by all means,” Bowen says.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to stop future supplements.
The man's body was found in Brighton's swimming pool
Sussex's police searched for an unidentified man's body before the afternoon, and the police closed the area close to the top of Volk's Electric Railway.
The police and assassin are working to find out what conditions the body was placed on the beach.
The man has not yet been identified.
Researchers will review the list of missing persons to determine whether missing persons are connected to the body.
The police have not yet been able to confirm whether death occurred in suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, an accidental explosion is one victim of death.
According to the police of Piedras Negras, an accidental explosion in the customs building at the borders of Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and the injury of five others.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas serves as an operational head of the local police of the city located at the Texas border.
He told the Associated Press news agency that a woman who died in a Sunday explosion had a skull damage and five others had burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion took place in the morning in the sleeping areas of customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but the authorities believe that the explosion was caused by the accumulation of gases.
The explosion did not affect border surveillance.
Three Atlantic City casinos close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month
Male customer plays at the Showboat casino, which is scheduled to close its doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
In September, it is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table.
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City in New Jersey, which means that this neon-light metropolitan, known from the money machine cliff, can no longer be counted for the game income.
More than 5,000 employees are unemployed at the end of the Showboat and Revel casinos this weekend, the Associated Press news agency said.
There will be more unemployed when Trump Plaza turns off its light.
Three casinos, one of which had only been able to operate for two years, the expected closure of the city is the last disaster of the Atlantic Club after the end of the story of the Atlantic Club only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the city’s casino workers, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, New York Times writes.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, the casinos were advertised as a certain choice for the poor economy in Atlantic City, the AP news agency writes.
However, the local gambling industry has gained a lot more competitors when the casinos of New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania are blocked by a large part of Atlantic City’s so huge casinos once.
Massachusetts, who opposed gambling before, watches his part of the amount of money by welcomeing three casinos to the state.
TVO: The new schedule of Areva is difficult to accept
According to the Industrial Power (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new estimate of the plant supplier Areva that the third reactor of Olkiluodo will only be available for commercial use in 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoise, the Director of the Power Planning Project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that the construction works are already largely ready and the number of intermediate works are known.
The TVO will continue to evaluate the information received from Areva.
Silvennoinen notes that TVO welcomes all initiatives to speed up the project.
Areva today provided TVO with an updated schedule of Olkiotto 3 that the third reactor construction works will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial activities could begin in 2018.
According to the Areva Communication, the recent delays in the project were mainly due to the approval of the reactor automation systems received in April.
Negotiations with the TVO lasted four years.
Olkito 3 was initially required to be completed in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed once afterwards.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about who is responsible for delay.
Denies the dispute in the arbitration court where Areva has demanded compensation of EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
In turn, TVO considers the Areva requirements unfounded and requires approximately EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation in the energy and water sector is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders met today within the 24th International Water Week in Stockholm, and they called on energy and water operators to work together to meet the biggest challenges of our time to ensure adequate water and energy production for the growing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often dependent on each other.
Energy is needed for water pumping, storage, transportation and cleaning, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two resources are also an integral part of sustainable development and should always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the International Water Institute for the Water Week, said at the opening of the Water Week, “the challenges are huge.”
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore urgently there is a need for closer cooperation between energy and water operators in order to find solutions to allow all world peoples to flourish.
This year’s water award professor John Briscoe described the water as a possible basis for growth, which needs both society as a whole and other sectors. Briscoe said that “the developing countries face major challenges.
They need to mobilize these funds.
Briscoe added that there is no permanent solution to the water crisis.
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a circle.
In the course of the week, representatives will discuss the ongoing and future work and cooperation of energy and water operators during more than 100 seminars, workshops and events.
Originally, Professor John Briscoe from South Africa receives the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty in the ceremony held on Thursday 4 September by King Charles XVI of Sweden at the Stockholm Town Hall.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research information and provides decision-makers with information to make reasonable decisions for water and sustainable development.
Flying dead foreign bodies home in Miami: The cost of flying bodies
In October 2012, 23 cuba refugee ships were crashed and 14 people were reported to have died.
The same has happened to hundreds of people before, and this is certainly not the last of their quality.
Every year more than 1,000 Mediterranean migrants die when attempting to unlawfully cross the US border.
The first city is ready to die.
It is ironic, however, that after reaching the first city in the country, few are planning to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, a hard drive upwards or a place of time waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people think they'll die there, and when they approach death, many are planning to return to their homeland.
In the popular cities of the migrants, a relatively large number of foreign-born and temporary residents live, and death and return to the home country continues to work.
It is estimated that 20% of the dead’s bodies in South Florida are flyed elsewhere, which is more than any other in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, a short form of professional slang of words) are flyed to the homeland from Miami International Airport.
Since 1964, according to Pierson, the largest company in the industry, CEO, about 80% of this traffic travels abroad. The company flys bodies to several destinations in Central and South America and to several European countries.
Source: Aer Lingus
The more migrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, the return will have its cost.
Miami is the main airfield of American Airlines for Latin American flights, and the figures of the table describe the human residues of the airline returned to homeland in 2013.
The return of the bodies to the home country is not cheap: prices can vary from five to hundred to thousands of dollars.
Religious, cultural and general health requirements related to flying and delivery of human residues also vary.
Migration communities in the popular cities of migrants sometimes organize funeral communities to help in costs, because the return of bodies is expensive, the government does not help the process and the dead are often young people who have no insurance.
A few credit institutions and non-formal health insurance programs have been born of such communities that were founded by Italian, Jewish and Greek groups living in New York.
The new generations of Mexican, Chinese, Phillipin and Bangladeshian migrants now work the same in many of their favorite cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties because few foreigners are planning to make their last rest in the migrant city.
For example, in Dubai without the will of the deceased foreigners, the Sharia law is applied, even if the laws on the recovery of the dead home country were different.
The entire assets of the dead shall be frozen, after which it shall be distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
A network of the Aer Lingus airline transporting human residues in Dublin (
2013) the scale reflects the multicultural population structure of the city and the Irish.
The airline suspended the service, but started it again in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from the migrants from the country.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person walks through the city popular by migrants or when he lives there.
On the contrary – temporary or permanent migration to the city of migrants is an open declaration of the way of looking at life, not death.
Death abroad, however, means making the immigrant the most powerful and irrevocable decisions – decisions whether they want to belong to a local or global community, the universe or the country, the short term or forever.
The Centre and the Left Association asks for inequality
The opposition parties to the centre and the Left Association are going to ask the Government a mid-term question about the performance of small incomes and the increase of inequality.
The parties want to raise the debate on people’s income problems, which are undermined by poor economic development and deteriorating unemployment.
The growing inequality is also seen between the different parts of the country and within major cities, the parties point out in their communication.
In the next year’s budget, the government’s cuts and tax increases are subject to small incomes, such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family and ordinary work while, among other things, food, medicines and housing continues to fall.
In fact, almost half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say in their communication.
Income problems in the workplace have also been worsened.
The Centre and the Parliamentary Groups of the Left Association will discuss this issue on Thursday.
The third opposition party has already announced to leave an interim question on the resources of police and internal security.
The session of the parliament will begin on Tuesday tomorrow.
The New York City West Indian Day Parade begins soon
Caribbean culture is once again in New York City, where the West Indian Day Parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and there the politicians also see each other and will be seen.
The annual paradise will be held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It is the celebration of the carnivals that precede traditional fasting times, and part of it are dancers that carry complex, often made of suli.
The president of the Brooklyn region, Eric Adams, is a festival champion this year, but there are also many other known faces in politics.
Parade is a great opportunity for politicians who are currently and candidates to welcome the public a week before the election.
Despite the celebrations, the parade weekend has also been involved in violence in the past years.
The police have said they are trying to keep the event safe through additional measures, such as monitoring the activities of the nearby gangs.
Is it worth even asking retoric questions?
Everyone knows retorical questions, right?
That question should not be answered.
This language image, i.e. a question that is not expected to be answered, but which suggests in the direction of a particular answer, tastes both high-fly speeches and a more daily exchange of words.
The initial words of the prosecution of Ciceron's famous Catilina are a chain of retoric questions, the first of which is "How long, O Catilina, are you going to use our patience?"
The same applies to my wife’s latelemical questions: “Why do you think I should not warm children five days old chicken?”
Why are you so tense?
The difference is a better word for the retoric question.
The power of the Retorical question lies in the fact that the issue is open and the public is bended to accept the question.
A mysterious rhetoric question lets you understand that no full-speaking person could agree with it.
In the 18th century, the author of the material writing guide David Williams described the question of the retoric question as “some of the addressed words that are admirably designed to produce a strong feeling of the truth of a subject, while their challenge is impossible to disagree.”
Skills of Falling
Retorical questions can be asked afterwards if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
A number of retoric issues that are designed to express sadness or irritation are called epiplex.
For example, Job uses them to appeal to the Almighty: “What do you benefit from to oppress me?
Do you have the same eyes as us?
Do you see the same way that man sees?
The chains of retorical questions are also found in my wife’s comments: “Why did you cause food poisoning for children?
Are you crazy?
Can't you do anything right?
In addition, there is also a hypophora, which is the case when you ask the question and respond to it immediately.
Isaac Hayes provides an excellent example of this: “Who is the black private egg that is a sex horror for all women?
Parru!
That's right, mooses!
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
More examples from my wife: “What is the only food that the children have eaten and where have they become sick?”
This chicken.
Who did the idiot feed it to them?
You.
It is strange that the rhetoric question usually does not try to bend, although retourism means the ability to bend.
If you're trying to talk about someone around, instead of trying to preach to those who have already been converted, or you'd be shy about someone's independence, you should use retoric questions savingly.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than trying to get another to accept their own opinion.
If the public agrees with the statement “I am not comfortable when it is so sunshine”, the retorical question says that the speaker is sure of his claim, which binds the speaker and the public better.
However, this only happens if the speaker is sure there are no different opinions.
Assuming that unanimity has been achieved instead of consensus, the speaker may seem, well, self-good.
In other situations, the retorical question refers to the weakness of argumentation.
In the headlines of the newspapers, the retorical question is too often the strongest possible argument in very weak cases: "Do space creatures develop pyramids?"
In both cases, the risk is that the question can lead to a response that differs from the suggested answer.
"Do you think the same thing we do?" was part of the UK Conservative Party's risky campaign statement in the general elections in 2005.
The party has disappeared.
Some of the findings of such cases have become a hobby, and the QTWAIN questions (the concept of Questions To Which Answer Is No, known by the British journalist John Rentoul) are popular.
A few years ago, one of my friends arranged a competition in which the best examples were sought.
The song “Do You Wanna Be In My Gang” was clearly won by pop star Gary Glitter before she became a child’s sexual abuser.
The author also wrote the book "You Talkin' to Me?"
Researcher: The time of the federal compromising may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries still thought that the federal government could be some kind of compromise with the conflict, says Saari.
Russian President Vladimir Putin previously said in the Russian channel interview that peace in Eastern Ukraine would require discussions on the state position of the region.
In practice, this would mean some kind of self-government in Eastern Ukraine.
Putin said it would protect the legal rights of those living in the East.
The change of Ukraine into a federal state, according to the island, is a certain priority for the objectives pursued by Russia.
Ukraine will certainly, for a reason, doubt that Russia would thus seek to influence Ukraine’s internal policy, he said.
If the federal solution cannot be resolved, the second alternative could be a frozen conflict from the Russian point of view, where Russia would effectively control Luhansk and Donetsk, the island would assess.
West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has denied allegations, even though, for example, Russian-minded rebels have told themselves that they have fought “loved, voluntary Russian soldiers”.
Head of Up: Kataiselle's influential mission
The brick reminds me that the work image is new and still outlined.
He said that Katainen would coordinate or even lead to the work of the Commission in matters relating to competitiveness and employment.
One of the priorities of the Commission's new programme is, of course, the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
This is how we are at the heart of the power of the Commission, Tiilikainen says.
The Brick believes that Katainen's background, economic skills and role in the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
According to the plan, it should be done without a portfolio, i.e. that Katay would not be under its control by its own DG.
Instead, Katainen would be a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment field, so that he could have other portfolios related to the sector, in addition to the portfolio of the economic Commissioner.
In practice, management of the team could mean planning and guidance, for example.
Military mothers: up to 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers Organization, up to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the past two months, and more than 7,000 Russian soldiers are currently in the country.
According to human rights organisations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organisation, close to the border of Ukraine, the Rostovi City Hospital has been wounded in the Ukraine War.
The mothers of the soldiers collect their information from the soldiers.
NATO has estimated that Ukraine has more than a thousand Russian soldiers.
BB-Andte of his alcoholic use: "A little drink comes up."
Big Brother Jussi and Andte were thinking about the life of the BB house on Monday night.
On the basement side of the basement, Jussi walked on Monday night with a fitness bike belonging to the Kartano residents.
The twins were wondering what their actions look like for the viewers of the program.
Not until he saw the road, Andte said.
Ifsin believes that most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending time.
Possible holidays or assignments form only a part of the BB house's life.
More is expected and wondered and talked and live.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
The people of the map spent Wednesday evening in wet signs, and alcohol was especially on Andte’s phone.
Jussi, the Intelligent Andtel, had the party made a man’s life more pleasant in the house now that he had been able to talk to them in a small hibraca.
I'll have a little drink, and then there'll be a thing, Andte admitted.
Look at the Andte interview from the ISTV video!
Let Abreu reveal his body beads in our women
Anna Abreu tells us in our women magazine that he decided to lose weight two years ago when he stayed at the show.
At that time, the tired Anna thought that weight loss would get more energy.
Fred Montana / Splash News
Let me dream of a guy like Victoria's Secret a few years ago.
My body was the style of Victoria's Secret.
I wanted to look good and I thought I wanted to lose weight, and Anna told the newspaper.
Anna, who presents his body with the plays and music videos, says that there is no celebrator, even though he has been named such.
Viena Kytöjoki
In Timm, let him train at the gym and do boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I can raise a certain amount of weight in the gym, Anna points out.
Sometimes the pop star allows himself to taste.
If I do, I really do.
Sometimes I'm pulling unhealthy blood, and I don't wonder if there's more pounds.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
I'm disgusted if I do something wrong with my body.

Entrepreneurs’ profit distribution will please shareholders, but does not increase growth
Are Australian stock market leaders now simply trying to please a large set of shareholders by proposing a greater profit distribution and buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power in the transition from corporate governments to shareholders that the government serves?
The distribution of profits is most important, it appeared last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of shares in companies that have rewarded investors in the form of repurchase programmes and by dividing more profits have risen clearly.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that the consumption of capital is reduced faster than the analysts have predicted. This fact makes many wonder whether the popularity is overweight for a short period of time and whether it is adequately focused on the growth of the near future and for a long period of time.
Some companies, of course, return money to shareholders and finance business with other means.
For example, more funding will be acquired from cheap stock markets.
From the point of view of the company, this is reasonable because the loan is currently cheap, while the capital is not.
Although the funds acquired from the loan market are not taken into account, it is clear, however, that open access to shareholders is primarily financed by the fact that the company spends less money on investing.
The net result of the wave of these purchase programmes (and the withdrawal of profits investment plans) is the decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period for a "capital deduction period" during which companies have tried to keep the stocks low.
As part of the same plan, companies still have less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the repurchase programmes was 3.7 billion dollars and the value of the expected unfulfilled capital procurement programmes was 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far that it considers capital consumption to be a circus in one of its reports.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, unofficial evidence has existed for months.
Glenn Stevens, director of the Australian central bank, considered it sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies needed a bit more "fighting spirit" to increase their investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the prospects of individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, as slow capital consumption usually leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse said that "the own estimates of reporting companies on the average of their capital consumption have decreased by 4% over the last two years.
The estimates of the amounts of free cash flow have risen by 2% on average.
Improved cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This fast eye seems good from the point of view of current shareholders and shares markets, but it is also some kind of evidence of corporate obedience.
If I could get a coin every time the CEO has said that the short-term price of the share is not important, I would... Well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this argument is not correct.
The CEOs are very closely following the prices of shares and are very concerned about price variations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of the CEOs are determined by the value of the shares and the status of the managers depends on it.
The CEOs want to say that some decisions (whether they are business trades, increased investment in the organization or profit distribution) may not always be immediately popular, but are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, corporate leaders often complain about the fact that there is a very short-sighted review on the investment market.
Therefore, the current conservative stack of conservativeism seems to be favourable to the short-term objectives.
In the opinion of those who evaluate the cheap share market and profitable capital savings, this concern does not exist. However, the final reporting period was too clear that the weight was in reducing the consumption of future capital and the most sustainable companies were welcomed.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held the first in reducing capital consumption, but many other companies also act the same – part of the forcedness and part of the fear that they feared the reaction of shareholders.
Why do investors pressure companies to share profits?
According to the Credit Suisse Strategic Hasa Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more income, since the profits of other traditional fixed-performance investment products have decreased, as the central banks have surprisingly lowered interest rates worldwide to bring more money on the market.
In this way, investors have been forced to seek profits and, on the other hand, pressures companies to share more profits.
The shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies with uncertain profit distribution.
Investors would prefer the money right away when more and more investors approach the pension age.
The statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that the distribution of profits had a lot of impact on corporate cost cuts and not on growth in turnover.
Public naked images leakage cases look like data circulating or email account breaking
According to Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources, the unknown hacker who leaked videos on the internet wonders about the security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of women's publicity people in a chatroom and said that he has more pictures of women, some of the described have reported that their images were fake, while others have said that it was a long time ago removed.
There are a lot of pictures and it is said to include Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actress Mary E Winstead.
After the hacking, the biggest question is what was done through the attack.
Was the images and videos real and where they were downloaded?
The most news source for images – a shameless and thorough attack on Apple’s iCloud service – is unlikely to be the most likely alternative.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in data security teams working within the house, which are responsible for trying to infiltrate the company’s own systems regularly.
"A large scale hacking Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not argue that the claim should be correct,” notes Rik Ferguson, Vice-President of the Trend Micro Information Security Research Unit.
A simpler and more probable explanation for these hackings related to persons of publicity (and for hackings of less famous people every day) is the leakage of the email address and password, either by guessing or by chewing data, i.e. by cheating on the person to sign up with their information on the real-looking site, and then the information is used against them.
Apple will continue to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used in iPhone to store settings and, above all, to backup images when transferred to the cloud server.
The user’s account can be logged in in in the iCloud service by providing this email address and password, and then their images and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has introduced a double-phase identification ("two factor authentication", 2FA), i.e. extra protection against intrusion to the account, where the owner's mobile phone is sent a code before you can log in to the account.
However, it was relatively few to use 2FA properties either because it is not known, or because it is considered difficult.
Apple will continue to investigate whether all the information is from its iCloud service, and if so, how widely the user’s accounts were invaded.
The company has not delivered an opinion on the matter at the time of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the "Forgot Password" link in Apple's iCloud service by first collecting the e-mail addresses of individuals, for example, from the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that the celebrities have used the same password in several services when passwords were captured through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's photos claims the images are real, but they don't tell you when they're taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that it could be a long-term hacking company.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took a terrible effort.
I feel condolences for all other hacking people," he wrote in his tweet.
However, the independent information security expert Graham Cluley pointed out that Winstead may have thought that he had removed pictures of his mobile phone, but the removal of a picture from the modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the picture.
Modern smartphones regularly store photos for cloud service because they often do not have room for a large number of photos taken by the user.
Apple's iPhone standard setting is to save images to iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft's Windows phones store photos for OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, provide automatic image and data storage service.
“The people take and remove photos, but they don’t understand that the images are downloaded from the account,” Cluley says to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "The abandoned does not always mean deleted," he says.
Pictures and videos can be stored for years.
If someone accesses the user's email address and password, he can reload all the images and videos that have been sent by email.
Photos from Apple’s service can be downloaded on Mac, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker released a screenshot that was alleged to present videos and images taken from Windows PC so far.
Two-step identification protects from such hacking because it requires everyone who attempts to copy an already existing account to another device to provide the original user to the device, usually the code sent to the mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account will be prevented.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer a double-phase identification for your account, but it is not yet known whether these public people used the service or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the images in which they are claimed to be are not genuine.
Ariana Grande's representative has said that the pictures in which Grande is claimed to be “full fake.”
Victoria Justice wrote in his tweet: “The naked pictures taken from me are FREE, don’t you understand?
Let me break the roots from the rumors immediately in the beginning.
Cluley brings out another option.
Because the people of publicity were targeted by hacking, they could have broken into their accounts by someone who managed their social media accounts or regularly managed their emails.
“I would like to know if an actor’s agencies or a representative have a part of it,” he thinks.
However, those publicity persons do not use one publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed one or more systems of the security attack or helped to configure it and changed the system so that all the information could be returned.
This was the case in the case of a floridian Christopher Chaney named "Hollywood hacker", where the hacker distributed pictures of Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis’ e-mail accounts in 2011, and he was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment in December 2012.
Chaney was accused of invading more than 50 people in the entertainment industry during the period between November 2010 and October 2011. In some cases, he asked Aguilera to take pictures of the star in the name of this stylist as a low costume, and then published photos online.
Chaney later apologized to say that his actions were one of the worst insults of privacy that you could imagine.
Chaney was also accused of spying two people online for more than ten years.
Cluley said "In the case of Chaney, the stars were broken into the email accounts, and they were changed so that someone sent their information forward after changing their password."
Cluley says that obsessive action of hackers breaking into these accounts "remembers the collection of butterflies".
They just want to collect such information.
In this case, it is possible that someone had encountered a list of data and login data for services such as Dropbox.
Hackers have also been able to try to intrude for a long time
or they had access to information about an email account, such as the address book, and then fished for other persons.
I don't think it would be a simple ICloud security hole.
Australia has provided its intelligence service to help the United Nations track 44 peacekeepers kidnapped in Syria by terrorists in Al-Qaeda.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusran is believed to be imprisoned by 44 Fiji peacekeepers, and this terrorist group captured a crossing place in the Golan hills last week and forced the United Nations to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday, and there is no information about their location.
Ministers participating in the UN Conference of Small Developing Islands, including Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon at the summit and has offered Australia’s help to rescue the peacekeepers in the absence.
“I am convinced that Australia will help the United Nations in everything he can, providing assistance for intelligence,” he said to the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We are very close to all the teams and friends of the intelligence network -- to ensure that we can find them and that they are safe.
Bishop has already convinced Fidži’s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia will use its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Philippines Peacekeeper group was reported to have escaped from the same controversial area.
The United Nations has supervised the Golan hills since the 1974 ceasefire of Syria and Israel.
Cheaters are trying to steal your money through a carbon tax eradication initiative, warns the Australian Competition Authority ACCC
Fakeers use the carbon tax withdrawal initiative to steal money, ACCC warns.
The Competition Authority’s SCAMwatch unit has warned consumers and businesses not to rely on government agencies’ too well-known offers that offer thousands of dollars of credit.
Fakeers may use the figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save goods after the carbon tax has been cancelled, and offering up to $7 000 for it, the warning says.
Fakeers may sound very convincing because they have discovered the personal information they use when trying to get their bank information or trying to get the victim to pay the reward.
They discuss topical topics to fool the victim.
Fakeers use other than carbon tax fraud to access money. Their stories are more advanced, and they take advantage of current things to build a scam around them.
The missing aircraft of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the death of Robin Williams have been inspired by scams.
The ACC advises the company to contact the company, instead of contact information provided by the caller, with the help of the contact information, if there is little doubt about the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or an e-mail from someone who claims to represent the government’s agency or company, such as the energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation for the cancellation of carbon tax, be careful.
If you believe you've been cheated and given personal information or transferred money to a fraudulent account, contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true – for example, the free money shared by the government – it is likely that.
Financial statements: Lipponen blames the EU's Russian sanctions
The former Prime Minister, Paavo Lipponen, criticises the sanctions imposed on Russia by the EU in an interview with economic statements.
Russia’s focus on politics is to drive its own interests.
The sanctions do not necessarily work," Lipponen says in the interview.
Lipponen has started working as a business director in the EC Arctic regions of the Central Economics Union.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank, as well as the EIB, suspended their project funding in Russia as part of the EU's economic sanctions.
"This means, for example, that the environmental projects of the Northern Dimension, with clear visibility, go into ice," Lipponen says in the interview.
The freezing of funding now impairs cooperation that may be difficult to rebuild, according to Lippose, if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Ice Sea region will continue as large as before.
He is currently presenting an explanation to the EC of the Arctic policy and the opportunities of companies in Finland in the north.
This is not affected by the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The study will look far forward, talk about ten years," he says.
It is rare that the elephant comes to low water or close to the facility, says Nature Pedagogi Vesa Heinonen from the lecture centre of the Museum of the Nordic.
The Vaasa Summer Bay saw the elephant swiming near the beach today.
According to Heinos, the elephant is likely to come after the Suvilahte food.
It's not crazy.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinonen.
He said, for example, on the Sundom Bridge, we will see in particular the spring and autumn norp, which will arrive specifically after fish.
Norppa is not a common species in the Vaasa Sea Region.
There is an elephant in the country in the villas, he will continue.
Norppi lives in the Peripheral Sea and the Saaristomer.
According to the South Australian Court, the murdered pizzerian owner Robert Vallelonga acted aggressively and violently outside the nightclub
A murdered South Australian pizzerian owner Robert Vallelonga.
During the trial, Pizzerian owner Robert Vallelonga acted aggressively against both his partner and his guardian only minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
At the lower court of Adelaide, the lawyers who accused Vallelonga for the murder of Vallelonga asked for his client to be released against the warranties because it was “selfly” for self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not serious enough to keep his client, whose identity has not been published, behind the prisons until the trial.
"The evidence suggests that the dead acted so aggressive that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
After that, a squirrel began, which led to that 40-year-old drunk man -- tore a security officer's shirt.
It is important to note that, according to the prosecutor, death caused one hit, which clearly refers to self-defense or defending another.
A 25-year-old man is still accused of killing.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconsciously near the Rundle St and Synagogue Place cruise around 2.25 p.m. on May 4.
He died injuries in the royal hospital of Adelaide the next day. Friends and Pizzeria’s customers remained mourning the "local legend of One Tree Hill".
According to the prosecutors, there was no reason for the murder of the accused, and after the case, he had said to the taxi driver, "he went to bed for a few days."
However, the security camera video now proves something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead acted aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got himself part of the hard and violent behavior," he said.
Our client has both the assumption of innocence and evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors opposed the release of the man because only one of the three security officers who were at the night of the disaster had been missing from Vallelonga.
According to them, the other guards did not consider him to be threatened, because "that was short", and he used the vocabulary of a big man because he wanted to avoid physical confrontation.
They also said that the taxi driver clearly saw the case would prove that Vallelonga was hit "very strongly" and that he had no chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered a man to be arrested until the next week, when he declared his decision.
Disputed delfine hunt began in Japan - justified as a tradition - Foreign news - Ilta-Sanoma
The poor weather was expected to be the beginning of the deteriorating hunting in the deteriorating world.
In the Japanese Taij city, the annual hunting season of delfines started again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
There is a huge resistance to the hunting that has been held around the world, among other things, the British newspaper Guardian.
In the Jahd, hunters drive hundreds of delfines to a remote slope, where mammals are slaughtered after choosing the most suitable individuals to transport to delfinaries and thematic parks around the world.
Delfin meat also ends up in food.
According to local authorities, however, the beginning of hunting was expected due to a delay in poor weather.
Information about the practice spread to the world with the 2009 The Cove documentary film on the subject.
During the previous hunting seasons, the hunters have criticised not only animal protectors, but also diplomats.
According to the opponents, dolphin meat has limited markets due to its high mercury content.
It is a tradition of hunting defenders, which are also read by the Japanese government.
Defenders have also reminded us that dolphins are not endangered.
Delfin yacht was resisted during the weekend in several countries to protest.
In Tokyo, the Protestants said the hunt would harm Japan’s reputation in the world.
There was also a Monday demonstration in Helsinki in front of the Japanese Embassy.
Some of the NATO Member States are uncertain about investing new troops in Eastern Europe
In NATO, the Military Union will share its views on the need to establish NATO bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic as a response to the Ukraine crisis, says Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military alliance to bring permanent troops to their countries, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
“Ukraine has given a new perspective on Russia’s policy and threatens to destroy European security,” said Michael Clarke Financial Times, director of the Royal United Services Institute of London.
The NATO Member States will be together in the beginning of the week, and the military union will have to publish its new preparedness plan.
The key issue of the plan is whether NATO can violate the TAE agreement signed in 1990.
The NATO and Warsaw Association agreed to put armed forces in an area between the Atlantic and the Uralvuors.
In practice, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic.
Russia freeze its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually withdraw from the agreement.
In view of the tightening situation in Ukraine, NATO will consider whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
“We need to have NATO resources in all NATO countries that need resources,” said Mr Malcolm Rifkind Financial Times, President of the British Parliament’s Security Committee.
Matt Guthmiller, the youngest flying around the world
When other teenagers learned to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
The 19-year-old Guthmiller just became the youngest flyer around the world – and yet alone, CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
South Dakota’s young man flew 30,000 miles to stop 23 times in 15 countries in five continents.
On his trip, Guthmiller was treated as a rock star due to his record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"Oh, too risky," and "Something inhabited, rich puppy just wants to see a little world and have fun."
Guthmiller did not have much to say to the rapporteurs of such comments.
Of course, I enjoyed a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that with my record, I will also inspire other people to go to the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's flight enthusiasm started when he was young, and first he asked his parents to eat at the airports.
Later, he demanded to get to flight hours.
My parents released me to a short 20-minute flight, but I think they thought that my enthusiasm would stop.
It didn't stop.
Guthmiller soon afterwards made an agreement with his parents to give him more time in the cabin.
I agreed to share my car with my father for the whole high school instead of having my own car.
In the exchange store, I could fly airplanes.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a flight license, and two years later, he signed a single-machine Beechcraft aircraft for a single flight around the world.
A young man studying at MIT University took care of the aircraft and made fuel calculations.
Many hours in the airs also meant that he himself needed an additional tank—
In practice, a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller said he had eaten a few inventions completely during a long flight.
Flying into the cloud was both fantastic and scary.
In other countries, air traffic controllers had no regulation to help them navigate around the storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just a little above the plane and which of them rose to the height of 45,000 feet and rip the plane into pieces.
Guthmiller's plane was not pressured and there was no oxygen reserve, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The number of fuels would not have been higher.
On the day following the interview, another young pilot, a 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died of his plane falling between the American Samo and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls his journey to the hardest part.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he believes that the rising phase is technically challenging due to the high number of fuels needed for 16 hours of flights.
However, despite the risks and even high locations, Guthmiller succeeded in breaking the record and collecting money for ATK training through Code.org.
He is a coder himself and founded his own company at the age of 12 years.
Guthmiller's goals are in the sky.
It would be great to set up the next Apple, but let's see how it works.
In any case, Guthmiller intends to reach high.
Go to the sky and you can achieve something great.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is harder than you think.
Lori Joyce was thrilled to order fans for his Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores around Canada after the Canadian W TV channel began to show the Cupcake Girls TV program in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one franchise entrepreneur was not suitable for the task.
"My French entrepreneur sat in his car and called me that a hundred potential customers would order out outside the store ready to buy a cupcake, and he wouldn't last the situation," Joyce said.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost chance for us.
After the event, Joyce decided to change the selection process of franchise partners to emphasise the company’s culture-related leadership instead of baking skills.
"Whoever can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he's had about 100 interviews for each 11 franchise movement.
We start with a six-week training, but employees work completely differently in the working environment, so the whole process is quite difficult. Therefore, training emphasises above all the appropriateness of corporate culture.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is vital for any small business development.
A strong and honest leader is able to edit and grow the organization, while a poorly suitable manager can cause expensive damage to the company.
"I thought that looking for a franchise entrepreneur would be like going on a date, but it's not true, during dating, you can do a lot to get to know another before getting married," Joyce said.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a permanent contract is signed, a guarantee is obtained and a new store is built.
Being a partnership with someone before seeing how a person works is a huge step and significant trust test.
The symbiotic relationship between Franchise Parties resembles a strong marriage because they have common objectives, explains Lorraine McLachlan, Chairman of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA) and CEO.
Therefore, McLachlan also believes that the franchise entrepreneur should be careful when complaining about the future franchise donor before entering into such a long-term partnership.
“This is the same idea as relationships: if a date partner is rude already on a date, imagine what he is in marriage?” he says.
Both parties are equally important to choose carefully and evaluate the future contracting partner and to pay attention to the smallest alerts on both sides.
McLachlan adds that fans like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time, those who act as a franchise giver must be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
On the basis of a successful parent company, the new franchise providers must conclude on the basis of which challenges they have faced and what skills the new franchise entrepreneur needs when faced with similar difficulties.
Companies acting as franchises for the first time may also ask for assistance from a franchises consultant to create a profile based on the practice of the industry.
McLachlan also reminds us that for the first time, those operating as franchises and entrepreneurs will be offered a great deal of help on the CFA website at lookforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will be easier later because franchises will learn to evaluate potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first franchises are able to give advice and help in the assessment.
"The first co-operation of the franchise partner helped Brian (Scudamore, founder and CEO of 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) significantly in this creation of a company and a franchise system," says Erik Church, O2E Brands operating manager. O2E Brands include companies 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
The franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he could not have created alone, so the first franchise entrepreneurs should choose this idea in mind.
Church has 216 franchise entrepreneurs who represent all three brands of O2E, and he is also a partner of the You Move Me company in Toronto.
The Chruch method to find the right franchise partner is simple.
“We can use a confidence test to ask ourselves, ‘Would I call this person to me for the weekend?’, he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'en', you probably don't want to spend a large part of your working day looking for solutions to big business challenges with them."
Church also points out that the O2E Brands company is largely thanking its franchise structure for its success.
In the company’s organization, managers often see their position in short term and in relation to lower management levels as very formal, while franchise entrepreneurs are engaged in a partnership with long-term objectives and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
"There are much more good sides in the French partnership than the traditional business structure, but the partnership is also much more intense," he says.
It is a partnership, not a vice-president and a local operational manager.
Such a partnership is harder, but well managed, it produces better results.
Rail delays lower the prices of cereals in North America
The delayed rail transport has led to a significant decrease in cereal prices in the North Middle East of the United States, weeks before the huge harvest is expected to lower the transport network under a new pressure.
In North Dakota, commercial grain siles offer farmers only $2.7 for bushels - about a dollar less than the control prices - as a reason for ensuring the capacity of the train rails, traders and farming organisations say.
IN Raw Materials
The problems are the most acute Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway with the BNSF Railways and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.
The Federal Railway Controller will hold a consultation on service issues on Thursday.
The North Poles have to use railways in the transport of agricultural products because they are far from river networks.
The delay in train transport increased when a very cold winter followed by a large harvest of 2013, which caused the slowing and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transport of crude oil from North Dakota Bakken’s oil flour formation has excluded cereal transport, which is not true according to railway companies.
According to the manager of an international cereal trade company, the costs of cereals storage and transferring sellers to ensure the use of the train have risen from zero to between $2,000 and $3,000 per year from the wagon.
Someone has to pay the costs.
"These costs will be paid either by the farmer or by the customer," says the CEO of the cereals business.
The U.S. Agriculture Agency estimates that North Dakota’s soy beans will increase by more than a third and the spring crop by 16 per cent.
Randy Gordon, President of the National Grain and Feed Association of the National Organisation for Cereals and Feed, says that “we are usually trying to start a new harvest from a clean table, i.e. the harvest has been sufficiently emptyed and the grain has been sold and moved.
But now we start late because of the last year's service problems.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it handles the transportation of this year smoothly.
John Miller, Vice-President of the BNSF farming products transportation company, said that the company has reduced the long-term transportation (trailers ordered by customers for more than four days) from the beginning of April 16 500, to about two thousand.
“We have moved almost everything from the old rain we had to move,” Miller says, referring to the last harvest to the remaining grain.
However, the latest reported speeds of the BNSF cereal trains were nine percent lower than in the second quarter of the last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that the development is "equivalent" but noted that the company is currently investing $5 billion capital this year in order to improve the processing capacity of all transportable products such as cereals.
The speeds of the Canadian Pacific railway company’s trains with problems due to the second summer are 11 per cent lower than last year, but clearly higher than the low speeds of the early year.
The Canadian Pacific railway company has said to the railway controller (Surface Transportation Board) that the changes made to the ordering system of its train wagons should improve its ability to handle traffic by 15-20% in the next harvesting period.
"The action plan for the autumn of the Canadian Pacific railway company focuses on continuous improvements in the speed of trains and efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more and more trains every week," said the railway company's representative.
The Ukrainian crisis can solve the NATO 'identity crisis'
The leaders, diplomats and experts of large countries have often been concerned about the future of NATO and whether the end of NATO’s mission to Afghanistan will also mean the end of NATO’s significance.
However, this concern is very premature, as appears at the NATO Summit held in Wales this week, with 60 leaders, including President Barack Obama.
There is no shortage of the world’s crisis, even to the extent that the departure of Afghanistan’s troops, which was prioritized before, is no longer the most important thing.
Instead, 28 government alliances are needed after Russia is invaded again in Ukraine, which is a shocking reminder that the threat of European independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
The world leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also move troops, promise more money for defence expenditure and re-establish defence cooperation.
In some ways, NATO has to praise Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) was looking for something for its purpose -- and it had a rather significant identity crisis," says Heather Conley, head of the European programme for the Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but has also been strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task on the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to make world leaders to create a common strategy to defeat the Islamic State Militants in Iraq and Syria.
According to the official opinions, the President will face significant challenges when attempting to inspire their bored partners to respond to military response, especially to those that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he leads the world to find a strategy to win the extreme Islamists, firstly ascertaining that "we don't have a strategy".
Western experts have set careful expectations for the summit to achieve breakthroughs from Ukraine or the Islamic State.
Additional economic sanctions are designed as the main means of punishing the event called on Ukraine to attack Russia.
The European Union officials discussed the matter this weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
The US officials pointed out that the countries of which Obama hopes for the main partners in the Islamic problem are not necessarily NATO members.
The collapse of problems could not be expected two years ago when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was conducted by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
A year earlier, Robert M. Gates used his last speech to say that the organization has almost achieved the "common military negligence" point.
The US officials continued to complain that other countries did not reach their financial objectives.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, United Kingdom and the United States – achieved this goal last year.
But now the White House officials say they noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign a contract in Cardiff in which they promise to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time the company has a genuine desire to see the potential threats in their real size.
After Russia's invading Ukraine, the Union's "defense promises are more important and more important than once after the end of the cold war", says Charles Kupcha, President of the National Security Council of the United States.
We are quite hopeful to achieve a consensus between 28 Member States.
Obama uses a large part of its journey to strengthen its commitment to defence cooperation for the benefit of the neighbouring countries of Russia.
The President will start his trip to Tallinn, Estonia, where he meets both Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian leaders.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia after Russia joined the Ukraine Crimean Peninsula this year, and NATO troops will be regularly recycled in Estonia when a new preparedness plan published this week is introduced.
The plan aims to shorten the time needed by NATO to respond to the attacks in the territory of the border states, the officials say.
The plan includes increasing air surveillance and other visible defence co-operation marks.
The changes pose a small risk for NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent bases for Eastern and Central Europe as a demonstration of friendship with Russia.
According to the officials, the new plan does not actually violate the agreement, but it may also be a semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want his name to the public in the context of the discussions before formal information.
NATO’s presence is likely to be described as a long-term, not permanent, the diplomat said.
Does Putin use a powerful "talviase" to Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has one ace in his sleeves with Ukraine.
The Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of the rebels of Eastern Ukraine and sending Russian forces to Ukraine's soil.
This is why the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
When the situation in Ukraine is tightened, western countries are planning more severe sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia has a card: winter is coming, and Ukraine’s main source of energy is Russia.
According to the American authorities, Ukraine’s primary energy sources are natural gas (40%) and carbon (28%), Geysar Gurbanov, acting at the University of Harvard, writes according to Business Insider.
When winter comes to Ukraine within less than four months and the carbon mines are located in the eastern part of the country’s conflict, Ukrainians are freezing to their homes when the gas supply is abandoned from Russia.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goals, Gazprom, the Russian energy waste, will help Putin to win the war in the end, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia interrupted the supply of gas to Ukraine due to unpaid invoices on 16 July.
Earlier this month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine’s debt of gas was already $5.3 billion (approximately EUR 4 billion) by 1 August.
According to the New York Times, Putin commented on the future winter as follows:
I think no one will think about it (in winter) anymore, except Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make this work easier.
First of all, the immediate termination of hostilities and the correction of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to refill the stocks, the necessary repairs must be made and ready for a cold period.
According to Business Insider, Putin’s comment can be interpreted as a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat in front of the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newma, a Japanese holding company Nomura, noted last month that Russian talks about addressing humanitarian issues and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will be strengthened in a few months if Russia can maintain the operation of separatists until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine has to pay for the gas supply that comes in advance unless Kiova has paid the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement that would allow the continued imports of gas temporarily.
Last week, Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseni Jatsenjuk said that Russia is planning to stop gas deliveries in the EU countries in winter.
Later, Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak told me that the speeches were infinite.
He said Russia will do everything possible to get gas delivered to EU countries.
Liberal Saudi Blogger received 10 years of imprisonment and thousands of scratch attacks
The Saudi Arabian court has held a 10-year imprisonment sentence to Raif Badaw, which was founded by the Liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement in May.
As a penalty, the sentence includes thousands of scratch attacks and million (approximately EUR 200 000) fines.
The judgment was founded by the fact that he had established a website degrading Islams.
On Monday, AFP was told by another founder of the organization Suad al-Shamari.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was already sentenced to seven years of imprisonment in July 2013 and to 600 raipies, but was appealed and reintroduced.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its unfairness.
Madventures Riku Rantalan Childhood Experience in Afghanistan: "It was one of the revolutionary human encounters."
Madventures published today a new book World Explanation - an explanation of the Adventure for everything.
We asked Riku Rantala for an explanation of the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
Riku also tells us about the most important human encounter in his life.
The author, journalist, Madventures, the other side of Riku Rantala is a busy man.
Today, a new book has been published, yesterday was a cinema in the Civil History and Wednesday starts the second production season of Docventures.
Since the morning, he has run from place to place.
From Maya's morning TV to take the child to a day home and from there to a week's room.
The most facially agreed interview is to be transferred to a phone interview.
Otherwise, I don't have time.
In the middle of all the rush he and Madventures, Tunna Milonoff has had time to stop and write the World Explanation Book, which, according to the cover text, is the adventur's manual for everything.
Everything?
Oh, pretty much promised.
The book reflects a number of themes, such as what is our future, why another culture is doing worse than another, why we are here and who we are.
We used the interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book includes both professors and artists.
We worked the book actively for about a year, Riku will tell IS on the phone.
You've been hacking a big piece of the book.
What is the main message of the work?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and the big questions is worth considering, because we can do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the idis of the book is to be a good reader of travel, but it is also intended to make people discuss and share ideas at home.
The debate can even lead to action, Riku says.
KUVA: Pete Aarre-Ahtio
One of your books is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We concluded that the human species is optimistic.
Despite the warming of the climate and the current state of the earth, it is necessary to believe that at some point we will make solutions to improve our situation.
The earth is an alcoholic.
First, it should admit that we have a problem, only then can change, Riku philosophy.
Riku says that some research suggests that Western humanity has reached the top of happiness in the 1970s.
After that, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
It can be concluded that when we have enough money and our basic needs are satisfied, we are happy.
Money does not increase happiness.
We want to raise people to discuss what is enough.
Using our natural resources is not enough for long, Riku says.
You also consider the differences of culture in your book.
How does an Indian person differ from a Finnish?
People don’t differ much.
Of course, the starting points, such as education, health care and hygiene, are different.
Culturally, the biggest difference is that the Community’s significance is much bigger in India in both good and evil.
When western countries are prosperous, people live more alone.
Separate others and may lead to loneliness and harassment.
When we find a suitable balance between socialism and loneliness, we would be quite close to happiness, Riku says.
Riku has faced many different people in the world.
What is the best human encounter in his mind?
It will be my childhood when I was with my family on the first major trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan when my father worked in the United Nations.
I was 7 years old, and two of my smaller sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku.
They came home to Finland with a big moving car.
We drove a war in Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the road.
On the road, my age girl walked on her little brother's arms.
I sat on a big bench with a cocktail in my hand.
Our eyes encountered, Riku describes.
The child of the age will understand the situation.
It was one of the transforming human encounters I will always remember.
KUVA: Leena Koskela
Riku and Tunta in 2013 at the book fairs.
At that time, Riku “went to the Challenge” that other people should be respected, even if they were much poorer or would not have the same conditions of life as us.
Riku realized at the time that money could not be a measure of human dignity.
People facing the New Guinea will rise from the memories of the adult.
I couldn’t stop wondering how traditionally people live there.
They use natural materials to benefit from everything, not just using money or metal tools.
They live in extremely challenging living conditions.
Survival is very difficult.
It had to think.
And he wants to think with Tunna to get his new book readers as well.
The idea is that our book will inspire people to read, watch and listen to more.
That it would make people work for a warm love for a conversation or even until a fist fight, Riku throws away.
This is about the Kauhajoki newspaper.
Events went off when the couple arrived at the bus station and ordered a taxi.
When the taxi went on the move, the man on the yard threw a taxi after some object.
The driver got out of the car, and the man who was a passenger.
The man who stabbed him was life-threatening to the head and hand and left the place.
The pusher is a 170-175 centimetre tank, a short-haired man.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, light pone-speaking woman in the vicinity of the event.
He is hoped to contact the police.
The police also asks for tips from all those who may have made observations about events or persons related to the case.
The stabbing occurred on Wednesday at 27.8 p.m. at 19.50 p.m.
"Hello!" said the brain to the brain - the world's first "telepacic" message passed through the net
PLoS ONE has published a article that suggests that the international research group has succeeded as the first to communicate the message directly to mind.
The first messages sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", i.e. Spanish and Italian "moi".
The electric brain curve of the sender tester was monitored in the test arrangement.
The sender was trained by the program to send bits either by thinking about the movement of the hand or foot.
The imagination of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of hands was the first.
This bite-coded information was sent through the Internet to the receiver person.
The receiver was caused by magnetic stimulation by observation of light depletion per single-coded bit.
The receiver was taught to interpret the flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still a field of research in their children’s shoes, but believe that computer-aided telepathic communication is routine in the near future of humanity.
Obligations - Point - The Future of the Landscape
The EU is preparing for new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also strangling their own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia wars in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international policy, action is followed by the reaction, action to counteract.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only be bitten in the long run.
Iran was inclined to talk about its nuclear programme only after years.
The South African Racial Orthodox Government sat in place for decades, although trade was banned by UN decisions.
Sanctions have also been made against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to take high-quality electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has put barriers to trade on the world page.
The last wooden store was frozen.
It is clear that the sanctions do not bring Russia on their knees.
The Russians are used to bad times and the disappearance of Viola from the store causes panic.
When the EU intends to ban the imports of vodka from Russia, the main issue is a joke.
The Russians prefer to drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to export aircraft to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest disadvantage for Russia is not to steal cheese imports or vodka exports.
The most harm comes from restrictions in the financial sector.
It only affects in the future.
The Russian state cannot operate in international loan markets.
It has to shorten the old loans, but it is difficult to take a new one.
Even though Russia has huge currency reserves, they can’t last forever.
The lending of Russian companies shines and money falls.
Your own banks are not able to finance everyone.
You need to weigh more money, or businesses have problems with payment.
The bankruptcies are competitions in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, Russia’s modernisation will stop, as said by Russian expert René Nyberg in Helsinki.
It wouldn't be the first time.
At the same time, Russia would return to Russia once again and go inward.
North Korea was held an exceptional free button event
Approximately 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed international free presses held in Pjongjang on Saturday.
In the event organized by Antonio Inoki, a Japanese member of the Lawyer, took part in painters from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free pressing, there were also taekwondo games of local athletes.
According to Inok, the purpose of the event was to converge the disputed states through sport and promote world peace.
In his speech, politicians wanted to improve between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan erased sanctions that it had imposed on North Korea as a result of the abduction of the Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea promised to reopene the investigation of these cases.
Last time in North Korea, the international free press was seen in 1995.
SOK reduces about 110 people from the trade in goods.
The YT negotiations began in June, where the reduction needs were estimated to be up to 130.
According to the company, overlap functions and responsibilities have now been cleared from its organization.
SOK says that it clearly calls for better cost-effectiveness and synergies between different industries.
In addition to the decline in the economy's recession and consumer demand, there is a structural change in trade which has been shaken especially by trade in goods.
The result of the S-group trade in goods has been lost for some time.
The YT negotiations concern all employees and managers of SOK’s use and day-to-day assets trading, i.e. approximately 530 persons.
Turun Says: Some of the self-medical drugs behind the stick
According to the newspaper, there are more medicines to be taken from the recipe and from the shelf to the medicine itself, which would be obtained without a prescription, but only after the advice of the pharmacist.
According to the Finnish Pharmaceutical Union, for example, eye drops containing antibiotics could be subject to advice.
After an interview with a pharmaceutical or provisor and in compliance with the predefined criteria, the drug should be given to ensure the dish, reflects Kirsi Kvarnström, President of the Pharmaceutical Union.
A few medicines are already available in Finland without a prescription, but a medicine that requires advice.
One of these is a pre-prevention product.
Corruption for more precise causes
Finland pays more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by the OECD and the Council of Europe because the world is confused with the deprivation of bribes and judgments in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice will consider whether the provisions of the Criminal Law would be necessary for trade and abuse of influence.
For example, the differences in legislation emerged in the case of the Patria’s bribe in the case of the Slovenian Harbor in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
In Slovenia, the trading of influence brought two years of imprisonment to the former Prime Minister, but the Finnish law does not know the same name.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has strengthened its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to the recently completed map, corruption is hardly studied in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report from the University of Vaasa and the University of Police in various areas of corruption.
Messi potee nivusvamma - Sports - Karjalainen
Lionel Messi, Captain of the Argentine Football Team, stays out of the mid-week country fight against Germany.
Messin keeps a nivus injuries on the side of the viewer, told his company to Barcelona on Monday.
Barcelona sees us as a precaution on the Mess page.
Messi insulted the nivus in the Sunday League fight against Villareal.
Barcelona won the match 1-0.
Messi also skipped the charity match in Rome.
Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he's going to have the Asian Champions League fight in Korea
Tony Popovich lacks three key players in Korea.
Many Western Sydney Wanderers team players have a game ban in the first match, and coach Tony Popovic is not hesitating to throw other players at the Asian Champions Leaguen witchship in the FC Seoul game.
The Wanderers are in Dubai at a 10-day training camp, including two friendship matches in Abu Dhab, so that the team can prepare for the first semifinal match on September 17.
Due to the excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole skip the Korean journey, but coach Popovic believes in their pioneers.
“Of course this is a loss — they have been three very important players in ACL for us,” Popovic says.
Tomi Juric was banned from this gesture in China.
It is a retreat, no player should be gone, but we didn't have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and so far Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Anyone will be replaced, I'm sure he's done a lot of work, and I trust the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play anyone against the semifinals.
The Wanderers must also be without Spiranovic, which still recovers from ankle surgery.
The Socceroos team defender was injured before the beginning of the season, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he plays in the return match at the Pirtek Stadium on October 1.
"He's back in career and he's going well," Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is a great news for him because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's been working out a couple of times, which is good.
It will take a while until he's completely okay, but he'll be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has the world’s top-century facilities at Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also believes that a trip to Dubai is a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the major changes in the end of the last season.
“We know this will certainly help players to create ties,” Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better on the field and outside.
So we use the camp for many purposes.
Elit hamburger pays three times the monthly salary of a worker
01.09.2014 21:18 in North Korea you can enjoy the luxury of wealthy economies if it hurts to belong to the elite of the country.
Financial Times tells the opposite of the retreated economy.
In North Korea, unofficial markets may flourish more than ever.
They offer wealthy or sustainable ordinary citizens a luxury that has not been used to joining the dictatorship state.
Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: a entertainment center with only a ticket to pay up to ten months of ordinary worker wages.
There's a place to get hamburgers who pay $76.
It is a 3-5 month salary for the country's normal dunar.
At the swimming pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and comfortable.
North Korea’s "western markets" began in the 1990s, when the country suffered famine.
The government allows them to exist, even though the prices of supplies can be the worst.
However, in the capital of Pjongjang, many have a mobile phone with a door with $200.

During his time, the administration has stressed the importance of technology in the flourishment of the country.

Ormiston House: the Council of Stormont's wish for sale
The Stormont Council hopes that it has found a buyer for Ormisto House, a building in Belfast, which cost taxpayers nearly £3,000 per week.
The Council purchased a building from the 18th century in the east of the city 13 years ago and paid nine million pounds.
The Council failed to sell the building further, when the security and maintenance of the building came to the Council to pay about 400 pounds a day.
The building was recently sold at 1.25 million pounds.
The building is likely to be used as a private residential building.
The Council purchased a building classified in the historically valued B class with 9 million pounds in 2001 because it needed more office space.
However, later it was noted that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after purchasing the building, it was resale at a price of 2.5 million pounds this time.
The building was not sold and the price was calculated.
Last year, the Ulster Unionist Party, Mike Nesbitt, suggested that the Ormiston House might fit into the new international trauma centre.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will negotiate the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner as long as the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the property broker remain silent about the identity and sales price of the buyer.
The weekly security and repair costs of Ormiston House are around £3,000.
The Council purchased the building from the police force, which preceded the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
By the beginning of this year, the security costs of the Ormiston House were £885 641 and maintenance costs £371 379.
The price of repair and maintenance professional services was 250 015 pounds and the fees of development and design professionals were 212 466 pounds.
The building was formerly owned by the shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was purchased by Harland’s business partner William Pirrie. Later, Pirrie became president of Harland & Wolff.
Shortly after the death of Lord Pirrie, 1924, the Harland & Wolff company became the owner of the building. The company sold it to Campbell College in 1928, who held it until mid-70s.
"Equivalence is increasing": Helsinki plans to reduce school supporters
There is no savings, says JHL.
In Helsinki, a radical reduction of the number of school assistants is being prepared.
The reduction would not concern the child’s personal assistant.
The Helsinki Education Board ended in spring to present around 2.7 million of the resources of school supporters.
In Helsinki there are about 600 school assistants.
If the contractions occur, they enter into force in the middle of the semester immediately from the beginning of the year.
According to JHL, the decision increases the inequality.
A growing number of children need support for learning.
However, it is unfortunately easy to reduce aiders for savings because the amount of assistance to learn is not clearly defined in the law.
No savings will certainly be born, on the contrary, the work burden of the teaching staff will increase.
In schools, savings lead to a greater risk of dropping the goals of learning and sharing teachers is hard, emphasising the JHL’s CEO Day Niemi-Laine.
The plans of the city of Helsinki differentiate schools because, with future resources, small schools and students need support no longer receive assistant resources.
The goal of the city of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
Profitable prevention work is done by school assistants.
However, the adaptation measures of the Ministry of Education are mostly aimed at this group.
All parties will continue to suffer from this.
The final solution to resources will be made by the Helsinki City Council in autumn, to whom I hope the vision and wisdom to look far into the future and act in accordance with its objectives, says Niemi-Laine.
Israel conquers the country on the West Coast
Israeli women are walking in a Jewish home named Gevaot near Betlehem in Etzion.
On Sunday, Israel conquered nearly 400 hectares of land on the west coast in the Jewish settlement area near Bethlehem, which may be a sign of Israel’s future significant construction in the region, while at the same time damaging the Palestinians’ request not to build more apartments and threaten the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli “Peace Now” group, who opposed the expansion of the Western coastal authorities, felt that Sunday events could be the largest single invasion of the country in the Western coast for decades and could “ dramatically alter the situation of the region”.
The Palestinians aim to establish their own state for the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, the political frustration of assessing the situation in the lands came after three Israeli young people were kidnapped and killed in June after lifting the area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian accused him of kidnapping and killings.
The timetable of the landing is to understand that it was meant to be a kind of reimbursement for the population of the settlement and punishment for the Palestinians.
Near the Jewish Gevaot facility in the southern Jerusalem Etzion region, the country has now been formally declared a "state" when it was prior to being privately owned by the Palestinians. This was a necessary step in order to allow Israel to start designing buildings.
However, Ahmad Lafi, Mayor of the nearby Palestinian City, said that the country belongs to the Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news agency WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff published early Sunday orders in which Israel announced to take over the lands of the olive and other trees of Surif and the nearby villages of Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Possible objections must be filed within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people caused the Israeli army to carry out a retreat on the west coast against the Islamic group of Gaza, Hamas, which Israel said was behind the kidnappings.
The tensions along the borders of Israel and Gaza bleached into a 50-day war that ended last week to Egypt’s fire break.
The power of the land has quickly paid attention to the Western coast of Israel and revealed the conflicting goals of the Israeli government that make the development of the Israeli and Palestinian peace process more difficult.
Lapland’s crisis is usually a lot of problems.
The growing majority of the municipalities of Lapland are in problems, reflects the well-being research conducted by Lapland University and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to crisis problems.
According to the professor, the reduction of municipalities’ duties by a billion euros is not enough.
The common features of the crisis include weak municipal economy, poor employment and loss of migration.
According to Asko Suikkasen, Emeritusprofessor of the University of Lapland, the new crises are coming from the West and Eastern Lapland.
In the survey, residents evaluate the situation of their municipalities quite realisticly.
In the study, the people of the well-fledged municipalities viewed the prospects even pessimisticly.
Fast expectations affect consumption.
People hope that the present everyday and well-being will be preserved, perhaps even a little better.
During this time, you are not dared to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a apartment, says Suikkanen.
The research team surprised the major differences between the municipalities.
For example, the cost of income support per capita varies far from a few ten to more than 100 euros.
The tax revenue received by the municipality per capita vary from two thousand euros to 4400 euros.
According to the shower, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How money is used, how much state contributions are received and what is the degree of debt, is much different in the same situations, he says.

United Kingdom may close borders from Islamistists returning to the country
The UK may temporarily prevent Islamist fighters from returning to Iraq and Syria.
This is the case with reference to BBC's government sources.
According to BBC, however, the British citizens suspected of terrorism would be allowed to keep their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of many proposals to be considered.
The proposal is currently being finalised, and Prime Minister David Cameron is to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way could be to increase the powers of the authorities so that they could temporarily confiscate passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, the United Kingdom raised the possibility of terrorism to the second highest level.
Bob Carr welcomes the immediate release of the Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from the libyan prison
The Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from liby prison today.
The federal government welcomed the news that the Libyan authorities are expected to release an Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that "all will go well" and the lawyer of the International Criminal Court will be released in the care of the Australian authorities this evening, after which he will rise to a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
“We are happy about the news that he is likely to be released today,” the representative commented on the AAP News Office in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the broader international community for the assistance and support, said the representative.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before he continues to go home to Haagi.
Taylor and three of his lawyers were arrested in Zintan’s Libylan city on 7 June when they represented Seif al-Islam, the son of the former dictator Muammar Gaddaf of Libya.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor brought to Seif papers that they believe threatened national security.
Senator Carr has seen a lot of effort to release Taylor, including traveling to the capital of Libya last month to Tripoli to drive this thing.
Taylor had not been able to talk to his husband or daughter before the last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to call his home soon after his visit to Australian Ambassador David Ritchi.
Carr also spoke with Taylor’s parents in Brisbane, John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor’s parents had bet on Libya to release their daughter before the third birthday of this little child in July.
The three other criminal court lawyers are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that, as a result of the discussion between the lawyer released in Hague and the Libyan authorities, “the lawyer of the criminal court was sorry and apologized for a possible misunderstanding.”
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of errors, but has promised to examine the actions of its team thoroughly after its members return home.
"After its investigation by the International Criminal Court, it will ensure that all those who have acted wrong will be judged properly," the Court announced in the Notice last month.
The International Criminal Tribunal calls for a trial to Seif al-Islam for crimes against humanity during his father's administration, which suddenly ended last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and made an initiative on 1 May, in which it declared that it would not accept the decision of a criminal court attorney to hold a trial in Haagi.

The collections to the Ferguson police ended mysteriously after $433,000 overrun
Surveillars closed two online collection sites without explanation this weekend after collecting sites for over $400,000 for a police officer who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri.
On the open GoFundMe benefit website, two separate pages that brought similar names – "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" – collected $235 750 and $197 620 for a fergusonic police officer who shot Michael Brown.
The similar site operated by Brown's family lawyer had collected $314 099 after Sunday afternoon.
The shooting followed a number of weeks of restoration and demonstration mostly against the nearly white police forces of the blacks. This forced Wilson to hide while the local and federal investigations were attempted to decide if he shot Brown for no reason.
The network collection campaigns have caused some increases in the defence of Wilson, especially since some visitors had written a comment on racist comments that have been later deleted.
Both pages apparently ceased to receive donations mostly at the same time on Saturday, and the administrators did not give a reason for this.
When he visits the site, he sees a message in which he says, "The money will no longer be received!
The organiser has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, GoFundMe's representative gave the Los Angeles Times a notice that the site has not prevented the donation.
"Every GoFundMe campaign organiser decides when he wants to stop receiving donations," said Kelsea Little, GoFundMe website representative.
Organisers may also continue to receive donations later if they wish.
The support Officer Wilson, whose yield was $197 620, maintains a charity group of St. Louis's police, Shield of Hope, who is the recipient of donations approved by the GoFundMe website.
The three official representatives of the Shield of Hope group, Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, were not immediately responsible for e-mails on Sunday, asking for more information about the collection campaign.
Zoll is the official informant of the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the City Council of Florissant and a member of the Roorda Missour's representative room.
The Times magazine also did not immediately contact the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page with an anonymous founder who uses the name "Stand Up" and has collected $235 750. He has not been confirmed as the receiver of donations approved by the site.
However, GoFundMe’s representative assured in his communication to The Times that an anonymous good factor exists.
The nominal charity of the collection campaign has only been provided to donors with little information, in contrast to other providers of Wilson’s website or Brown’s donation site.
The unnamed Wilson charitable wrote a message to visitors two weeks ago that the page collaborates with the Shield of Hope group to become an officially accepted donor.
Approval has not yet been granted.
The charitable gave more information to the visitors who wanted to have a password-based Gmail e-mail address, but did not reply to the request immediately on Sunday.
In its communication to The Times, the GoFundMe representative said that an anonymous collection page has been removed from the search results of the main site and added that “the campaign will no longer meet the requirements notified by the GoFundMe website, according to which the Facebook account must be used.”
In the GoFundMe website’s information security practices, users are invited to “speak only for GoFundMe users who they personally know and trust in.”
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection website published on the GoFundMe website is accurate and fair.
According to Mr Little, however, GoFundMe has been in contact with the campaign organiser and has no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to arrest all the funds collected if research is needed in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered appropriate to reserve the funds collected by that campaign.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organised Wilson support campaigns, told the followers of the page at the weekend that lawyers are trying to find a "explain" why the donors of the GoFundMe website have been prevented from donating, but the page did not provide any further information.
The Facebook page also has anonymous operator, and the independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
