Wales’s representatives are afraid to look stupid.
Some members of the delegation have been confused by the proposal that their title should be replaced by the MWP, namely the member of the Wales Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Kohu began with a plan to change the name of the delegation to the Wales Parliament.
Regardless of the party’s position, the members of the representative board are concerned that the change can make them ridicule.
According to a representative of the Workers Party, the group is concerned that the name is "critical with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means cake.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group is "not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to the representative of the Conservative Party, his group is going to think of the word "open", but he points out that the word "WP" is a short-speaking trap of a stupid word.
In Wales, the w letter is expressed in this context in the same way as the U-word of Yorkshire.
The Commission, which currently draws up the legislative amendment necessary for the change in the name, said: "The final decision on the headings of the members of the delegation is, of course, to the members themselves."
The Wales Administration Act for 2017 empowers the Representatives to change their name.
In June, the Commission published a question of opinion on proposals that the appointment of a representative body as the Wales Parliament would benefit from broad support.
The Commission favours the title of the members of the delegation as members of the Wales Parliament or the shortening of the WMP, but the MWP was most supported in the public opinion survey.
Members of the representative board are apparently proposing alternative headings, but the lack of consensus may lead to a major consensus to President Elin Jones, from which the legislative proposal is expected to change within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also includes other changes in the activities of the delegations, such as the rules on the loss of the representative action and the form of the committee system.
When dealing with legislation, the members of the Board of Representatives may give their final vote on the title they should be called.
Macedonians are going to the election course in the referendum on the change of the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether the name of the country will be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum aims at solving the dispute with Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia, over the decades.
Athens has long repeated that the name of the North Neighbour is in practice a regional requirement for its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that the change in name is simply the price of EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins' watches slow down when Harlem's churches live in difficult times
"The old people I've discussed with say that before every corner of the street there was a bar or a church," Adams said.
“Now there are neither.”
He said that losing the bars is understandable.
He said, "Working with people has changed."
“Bars are no longer the common living rooms of the neighbourhood, where people regularly meet.”
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of the property does not carry as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the source box."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments that are not the ones who support the remaining saints of the neighborhood.
"The most people who buy apartments from these buildings will be white," he says, "and so they will have to close their doors permanently because it is unlikely that most of these people who change these rooms would become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black-skind residential area - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
In the 1930s, the original methodical congregation of whites moved away.
The nearby church of black people acquired the building.
St. Martins took over the church of black skins by pastor John Howard Johnson, leading the boicot against the 125th Street traders of Harlem’s main commercial street, who were against these opponent black skin hiring or elevating these black skins.
The fire in 1939 damaged the building badly. When Father Johnson’s congregation members planned rebuilding, they introduced a tower watch game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martins, proudly called the tower cell game "clocks of the poor list".
In July, the expert called the Tornikello game called it "cultural island" and "unreplaced historical instrument".
The Michigan University expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that it was the world’s first black music tower play. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a bigger tower cell game in Riverside church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
St. Martins has recently developed a complex sky that is involved with architects and contractors hired by the church’s world leaders and the episcopal hijacking on the other hand.
Sakasti - the administrative body of the church’s leaders - wrote to the hippo in July free concerns about the fact that the hippo would “will take the costs” to the sacat, even though the saggage had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the hippo.
Some congregations complained of lack of transparency regarding sludge.
Hai damaged a 13-year-old humiliator in California
The authorities tell me the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and damaged him when the boy dived the humors on the opening day of the humor season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told the San Diego KSWB that he dived with his friends on Saturday morning about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and the group were melting with the boy to help him out of water.
Hammel said he thought that the boy was just excited after he caught a hummer, but then he realized this screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!'
After getting to the boy, Hammel says he noticed that this whole solo had been torn open.
"I told everyone to get out of the water: there's shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flyed to the Rady Child Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The type of shark attacked is not known.
In the media event, Captain Larry Giles said that the area had been detected a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be an unsafe species.
Giles added the victim's serious injury to his upper arm.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casabladin Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for the United Kingdom's Beauty Care
I gotsbury's challenged Boots, Superdrugin and Debenhams' commodity departments of beauty in which expert advisers serve.
This is an important movement for the UK's 2,8 billion-dollar beauty care facility, which continues to grow, even though the sale of fashion and home reserves is weakening. Larger beauty care departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country, and they will be expanded to other stores next year.
Beauty care products are placed because supermarkets are trying to fill the shelf space previously reserved for television, microwave and households.
Sainsbury's says its beauty care range will double to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
The Supermarket will also regain its Boutique makeup range. The majority of products will continue to be vegan-friendly because young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop odourwater chain attempts rental shops in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon in South London, and the second was opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet purchases and the transfer of food purchases to small purchases in nearby shops forces supermarkets to invent new attractions for customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that shops will look more like stores when the supermarket chain fights against cheap shops like Ald and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores and also Habitat stores. The company says this has promoted food sales and made purchases profitable.
Supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew its beauty care and pharmaceutical departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended with the debate on how the revenues of supermarket pharmaceuticals should be distributed.
The new strategy follows a business store where Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmaceutical business to the Lloyds Pharmacy chain with 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company told Lloyds to be part of the plan that extends the range of luxurious skin care products to four stores with signs like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s commercial leader Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty care departments to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in specialized staff who are willing to advise customers.
Our brand range meets all the needs and attractive environments and convenient locations make us a convincing shopping site for beauty care, which challenges the traditional way to buy."
Peter Jones "in the rage" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million pounds agreement
The Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in "rave" when the TV director Holly Willoughby retired from the 11 million pounds of his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and home brand Truly.
The twin company has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old director of this Morning program announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered the Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing their profitable lifestyle business in the last few moments. He now intends to focus on his new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say Jones was "raved" in the last Tuesday's tight-sounded meeting, held at the head office of Jones' business in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV's astronomer had admitted that his new 1,5 million pounds were not left enough time for their home and installation brand Truly.
The company has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand, and it was estimated to double Willoughby's assets of 11 million £.
37-year-old Willoughby reported leaving Truly in Instagram, Jones flew one of his holiday homes from Britain.
According to one source: “Truly was clearly Holly’s main project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his success for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left all the astonishment in power.
No one had faith in Tuesday events so close to the publication.
Marlow’s head office has a stock full of products that are expected to sell.”
This Morning driver is one of the UK's most secure brands, and his departure may, according to experts, cause millions of losses to the company due to the investment in products that include all pillows and clothing for home supplies, not to mention delay in publication.
It can mean the end of long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his spouse Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones for ten years and this wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby held Cappin Trulyy in 2016 and Jones, who was 52 years old, became president in March.
Couples holiday together and Jones owns 40% of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby will be baked from M&S’s new brand ambassador, and he will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm A Celebrity programme manager.
The source near Jones said last night, "We didn't comment on his business."
A hard speech and then we fell in love
He was joking about the criticism in the media about his comments that some would consider to be unsuitable to the president and their positiveness to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be a "Newsanker."
"I didn't give up any."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had inspired the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea's nuclear warfare.
However, the nuclear negotiations have been contaminated.
After more than three months of the Singapore Summit in July, the North Korea Summit Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North Americans do not see a "responsive reaction" to the early military operations in North Korea.
Instead, he said that the United States would continue to pursue their sanctions, whose purpose is to maintain pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"The North Korea is doing great," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such a great relationship.”
According to him, efforts to improve relationships with Kim have produced positive results. Software tests have been completed, hostages have been helped to liberty and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get out of here with 10,000 more people, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing directly to the audience in front of them.
Indonesian tsunami and invasion destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
As an example of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told that they were not needed.
The state of emergency required for international assistance was not declared, although about 10% of Lombok’s inhabitants had remained homeless.
“In some cases, unfortunately, they have made very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a bit challenging,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is a returning group, it is not sure whether foreign staff can work on the field.
Sutopo said the Indonesian authorities will assess the situation in order to see whether international organisations are allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Indonesia is still unfortunately unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account repeated earthquakes regularly.
Although Acehi has been built with tsunamiproofs, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The salary probably lost human lives due to the lack of tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was valid.
Travelling between the numerous islands in Indonesia is challenging even in the best circumstances.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship assigned to help victims of the earthquake in Lombok is on its way to return, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new accident area.
Even President Widodo made the development of the infrastructure in Indonesia a centre of its election campaign, and he has made money to improve roads and railways.
However, the number of governments have been undermined by the lack of funding while the new elections are approaching next year.
Some’s pressure is also increased by tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslims majority of the country has adopted an older form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street fights with jungle knifes, arrows and other original weapons. This has led to more than 1,000 people's death and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool embedded a late balancing against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat on Saturday after painting 89 minutes on Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an input from Xherdan Shaqir 27 away from Chelsea's paint when his team was at the goal of defeat.
He moved the ball to the left before he frightened the shot towards the back.
The shot slided above the punishment area towards the right corner.
Finally, the ball dropped to throw over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the network.
“I was just trying to play myself to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as much upwards as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, took one touch and fired without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the game in the mid-term of 1 to 0 Belgian Eden Hazard painted in 25 minutes.
In the situation, the Blues arm gave the mateo Kovacic a heel feed before he roamed near the center of the field and spurted Liverpool to the field.
Kovacic played a fast wall feed on the middle field.
Then he released Hazard to the punishment area with a great passover.
Hazard escaped from the defense and passed Liverpool to the back of Alisson Becker's left leg.
Liverpool meets the Masters League in the block phase of Naples on Wednesday at 15 a.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meets at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of tsunami death victims in Indonesia rises to 832 deaths
The Indonesian disaster agency reported early Sunday the number of earthquake and tsunami death victims rose to 832 victims.
At the press conference, the agency’s reporter Sutopo Purwo reported that many were trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, when the 7.5 magnified earthquake hit on Friday and raised up to six metres of waves.
The piles of buildings spread widely to 380,000 residents, please.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man as suspected of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death
A woman's body found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 at Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect.
The police are asking the people in the area to sign up if they have seen or heard something.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in its element, but I appeal to everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard something.
I also call on all, in particular, taxi drivers who may have recorded something on the instrument board video, to contact the police. They may have vital information for research."
The police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
Today afternoon, the crime scene has become known to a woman who has asked about her where she was found.
In the course of the investigation, the police said they were trying to inform the victim about the events.
The taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told me that no one was allowed to get in or out of the building.
He was unspeaking when he found out what had happened.
The people have just learned that they can go for hours before they get back in.
One officer was heard to tell the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
There was a crying woman at the scene.
He repeated that "it's terrible."
There were two insulations in the two afternoons, and the third outside.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who supervised the building.
Everyone who knows something is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call anonymous Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111 using the recognition of 247 on 30 September.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament was part of the rewriting charter of history
The extinguishing of the statue would be a poetry right, given that his own fanatic puritan bearers destroyed the cultural and religious monuments of England as the best talibanas.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "typeryde" and "rewriting history".
The Cromell President, John Goldsmith, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statue would make a goalboard of Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of the palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not command or execute the iconic of the British Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell might have to suffer from his ancestor Thomas’s actions in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s great description of Cromwell reveals the opinions of the 18th century, and it is a historical evidence of the character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Monet, although perhaps more in the 18th century than today, thinks Cromwell as a defender of Parliament’s external pressure, which, of course, was caused by monarchy in this case.
This is a precise description of the subject of a continuous historical debate.
At least, it is certain that the mid-19th century dispute has shaped our nation’s later development, and Cromwell, on the other hand, must be identified as a character representing the second half of that division.
In addition, his achievement as a state manager deserves to be thankful and remembered.”
Killing pigs muddled a Chinese farmer's lives
Local media tell the pig attacked the farmer and killed it on the southern China market.
Only the body of a man identified by the name "Yuan" was found near the pigala near Liupanshui on the market in Guizhou County. The man's arterial was broken and he was in blood, the South China Morning Post news on Sunday.
The pigs are prepared to vaccinate pigs in Xining in Qinghai Province of China on 30 May 2005.
He and his cousin were told about the nearby Yunna province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
His cousin found him the next morning, and he also noticed the door of a close pig.
In the pig, he said he saw a big scream whose mouth was in the blood.
According to the news, a criminal investigation confirmed a 250-pound glove from the lives of the farmer.
Guiyang Evening News says a cousin named Wu said "My cousin's legs were bloody and ruined."
The surveillance camera looks like the cousin arrives on the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig killed by the man was not belonging to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the leaders of the tower told the Evening News that the pig was locked behind locks so that it would not harm other police in collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reported to negotiate compensation for the death case.
The pigs are known to attack people before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, nearly 300 kilos of pig shines against this tractor of the Wales farmer until the wife managed to remove the animal’s path.
The Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the event, the farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News channel that, although the pigs are usually not aggressive, the taste of the blood can function as a "slave."
"They're just toys.
They are like little children, very curious, and their purpose is not to hurt.
You just have to respect them properly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants bring large hard drives to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to deteriorate when moving to the cooler waters of the Northern Coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods to South Mexico and the United States.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 metres per second, i.e. the hurricane of the first class, on Sunday morning five from the east coast, and was 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific Sea is forming a low pressure that heads east towards the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives on the California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it begins to sweep deep tropical humidity northwards towards the southern United States.
On Monday, Rosa brings up to 250 millimetres of rain to some parts of Mexico.
After that, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching low pressure will form large rain areas to the southwest in the next days.
Locally, between 25 and 100 millimetres of rainfalls cause dangerous heavy density and potential land vultures in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes 50-75 millimetres of rain in certain landing areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
For some areas in southwest, and in particular Arizona, up to 50-100 millimetres of rain is expected.
Strong rainfalls are possible and conditions can rapidly weaken due to the fragmentation of the tropical rain.
The threat of tropical rain is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the wilderness.
The rainfalls can turn the canyons into underflowing rivers, and thunderstorms create local windfalls and flying dusts.
The approaching low pressure area brings local hard drives to the southern California coastal areas.
Over 10 millimetres of rainfalls are possible, causing small waste flows and sliding roads.
This would be the first rain in the region.
The scattered tropical raincubes begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday until the rain spreads on Monday and Tuesday.
The rainfall spreads to Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts throughout the Wednesday.
In October, in the United States, there can be a lot of strong fluctuations in the temperatures of the Arctic region in the cooling, but while the tropic remains quite warm.
This sometimes causes high temperature suppressions in short distances.
In the middle of the United States, there is an excellent example of large temperature differences on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omahan and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowan Des Moines is almost 20 degrees of temperature.
The summer’s delaying heat continues to grow and expand in the next few days.
From the beginning of October, warmth is expected widely in the middle and east of the United States, while the temperature is +26 degrees, which feels like southern flats in parts of the northeast.
In New York, the temperature can be painted on Tuesday to +26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than the average.
According to our long-term forecast, the east of the United States has good opportunities for higher average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million looked at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million watched six television channels on Tuesday, in which the Supreme Court’s Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual crime in the 1980s, gave their fascinating witness statement.
At the same time, the political patch situation continued when television companies suspended their broadcasting with the last minute reverse that the FBI conducted a week-long investigation on the basis of an agreement organised by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona.
Ford told the Senate’s Justice Committee that he was 100% confident that Kavanaugh lost him and tried to take his clothes off in high school.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave a sentimental witness statement that said he was 100% confident that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company decreased the average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels of viewers.
Other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers in offices.
Some of the proportions suggest that the reading corresponds to the number of watchers in the American football game or Oscar gallion.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers in all television companies was on Fox News Channel, whose opinion directors strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment. On average, the channel had 5.69 million viewers throughout the day during the consultation.
ABC was the second with 3,26 million viewers.
Nielsen said that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
After hearing, your interest was still high.
In the middle of the Friday drama, there was Flake.
The CNN and CBS cameras described how the protesters cried him on the way to the elevator to the hearing of the Judicial Committee on Friday. The moderate republican background forces had previously announced that he was voting for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed up straight, how he stood at a minute shop, watching down the rings fly.
"Seison right in front of you," one woman said.
“Do you believe he will tell the truth to the people?
“You have power when so many women are incapable,” he was told.”
Flake said that his office had issued an opinion and added before the closure of the elevators that he would have more information after consulting the Committee.
Hours later, cable and broadcasting networks were sent directly when the Committee on Justice began to vote for Kavanaugh's appointment to vote for the Senate Assembly.
However, Flake said it only works in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate in the next week, as the democrats in the minority have demanded.
Flake was convinced in part by his friend, democrat Chris Coons, on the basis of his discussions.
Flake made his decision after discussing Coons and several other senators.
The choice of Flake had power because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched a FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit's political effort
The Prime Minister Theresa May blames on the interview of the Sunday Times magazine for criticizing his EU-department plans for politicians, which threatens the future and national interests of the UK.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In addition to May's interview, on the first page of the newspaper, another interview was published, where his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued to attack May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls on the UK and the EU to charge each other's import duties, "to be completely insane".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as suspected of the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a person as a suspect in LSU for the shooting of a 20-year-old Wayde Sims.
A 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison. According to Baton Rouge's police department, he is accused of murder of another degree.
The authorities published a video of Sims and Simpson's interim investigation, where the police told Sims to lose their glasses.
The police found glasses at the scene and told me they found Simpson's DNA, says WAFB.
The police said Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde in interrogation.
According to the Advocate magazine, his warranty amount was set at $35,000 in the US.
East Baton Rouge's municipal examiner released a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a shooting wound in the neck.
The Agency thanks Louisiana State Police Branch Group, State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and the residents of the region for assisting the investigation leading to arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's head of exercise, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "extinction and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne's father played basketball LSU:ss.
He recorded on average 5.6 points and 2.6 record balls in the last season.
LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning he was "ashamed" and "ashamed" from the death of Wayde.
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wayde said.
The volcano spits over Mexico City
Ash detonated from the Popocatepetl mountain has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Prevention Centre urged citizens to stay away from the volcano when the crater’s activity accelerated and during the day was registered in 183 gas and ash explosions.
The center registers grains and vibrates several times.
In the social media, pictures were published where the windscreens of cars in residential areas like Mexico City Xochimilco covered a thin ash layer.
Geophysicists have seen 72 kilometres from the capital to the southern volcano since Mexico was shaken by 7.1 magnified earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan Separatists take together before the anniversary of the Independence Vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested at the convening of protesters and riot police. Thousands participated in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the dismissal vote.
The police arrested the group of masked independents who throwed the police with eggs and powder paint that formed dark dust clouds on the streets normally filled by tourists.
During the day, more champagnes broke out when the police used their bats to cure the nuts.
The coincidence between the supporters of independence and the groups of Unionists continued for several hours, when the previous screamed “no forgetment, no forgiveness,” and the latter “love Spain.”
The local press says that fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries in demonstrations.
The excitement is still on the surface of the independent area after a year after the 1st October referendum, which Madrid declares to be illegal but celebrated by the cathanese separatists.
The voters chose independence by a clear majority, although the participation was a vote in the boicotide against low differences.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured in the violent gatherings of the last year when the police tried to prevent voting at voting places across the region.
Independence groups stayed outside Friday to prevent national police support from demonstration.
However, it was held, but it had to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the demonstration of separatists with his wife, said that there is no longer hope for the independence of the Catalan.
Last year, we experienced one of the best moments of our life.”
I saw my parents cry for joy when they could vote, but now we're stuck in place," he says.
Despite its vital victory in the last December regional elections, the rate of the Catalonian independent parties has declined this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are in volunteer exile or are arrested waiting for a trial on their participation in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who photographed a police demonstration on his phone, says on both sides of the politicians, is controversial.
"Your business gets tightened all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the catalonian leaders in the last nine years in prison, announced to participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"It is the best way to condemn the grieving and oppression of democratic values we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.

Somewhere near the car, they may have fired with a sleeve.
Livingston won Rangers 1-0 at Menga
Dolly Menga’s first goal in Livingston ensured victory
Livingston’s serial shooter shocked Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second defeat in the 18th match as the manager of the Ibrox Society.
Dolly Menga’s goal was ultimately enough to win Gary Holt’s team when he got up to another place with Hibernian.
Gerrardi's crew was missing the first guest win in Premiership, next Sunday, the Serial Director Hearts, which is eight points ahead.
Rangers will meet again in the European Union of Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his lossless pipe in the series for six matches, and the main coach Holt has not lost once after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places to a visitor who suffered a lack of steel
The Holt team should have led a long time before its goal, after causing Rangers the evil difficulties in their performance.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and then Alan Lithgow was able to slip into Craig Halkett's bucket, but he passed the ball.
The hosts gave advantage to Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate from special situations.
The important goal just came in this way.
Rangers caused Livingston a free kick from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played to Menga a place he could move the ball to the center of the punishment area and finish.
By then, Rangers had kept the ball, but he said the home team was defending, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not able to just try it.
The same pattern continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor prevented Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow steering the ball from another special situation in Livingston.
The concentrations of Livingston’s punishment area were continuously cleaned. In addition, two situations were required to be in vain - Halkett’s deferred exchanger Glenn Middleton and the ball hit in hand.
"Great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotlann Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni
Beautiful performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent for every player, continuing through the rising leads.
However, the team’s game mode and crew have not changed much to get back to the highest serial level.Holt must be acknowledged of the way in which he has strengthened the team after reaching.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was incredibly led by the organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toes of the whole match.
But Rangers lacked ideas.
The team has sometimes appeared very well under Gerrardi’s authority, but has now remained far from his demand level.
The last feed was exhausted, and they managed to open the defense of the home team only once. This should act as a awakening for Rangers, which is the middle box of the series table.
Erdogan received a different reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and sky on the blue Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the contested German visit by President Erdogan, the purpose of the journey is to improve the relations of NATO allies.
There have been differences between human rights and freedom of the press and the EU's efforts in Turkey.
Erdogan continued to travel to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population is outside Turkey.
The police prevented 25 000-dollar forces from gathering in front of the mosque, based on security reasons, but still a lot of supporters were gathered close to the president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's protesters, many of whom were Kurds, also brought their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Contesting protests reflect the distribution of opinions, some of the German Turkish people greet him as a hero when they wake him up to be self-righteous.
Inconsistency in Deptford: A bike driver dies in a crash with a car
A bike driver died when he crashed into a car in London.
The accident took place at about ten local times at Deptford’s southwest department near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, with a high traffic.
The car driver stopped and the care staff came to help the victim, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another bicycler died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from the Saturday accident.
The city police say they're trying to identify a man and inform his friends.
There are road shuttles and bus traffic has been redirected elsewhere. Car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in troubleshooting
Prison officials report the high security rating of six injured men in prison in the restoration of the prison.
The restoration began at HMP Long Lart in Worcestershire on Sunday 09:30 and continues.
The place has been brought to the Tornado Special Police to calm down the restorations behind eight prisoners in one prison wing.
The low-face injuries of the police were dealt with at the scene.
One of the inmates said: "HMP Long Lartin prison has been sent to a specially trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and it is clear that responsible people are taken from police care and they may need to spend longer behind the barrels.”
HMP Long Lartin prison has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison manager was reported to have received hospital treatment after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In October, the police were alerted to prison due to serious restorations in which staff were attacked with biljardi balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drying areas can benefit)
There are rarely tropical low pressures in Arizona, but that’s exactly what happens at the beginning of the next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remains move over the southwestern desert, bringing with the risk of severe degenerations.
The national weather service has already provided warnings to the cities of the southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast Caifornia and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrives on Monday in the form of rains.
Phoenix’s National Weather Service pointed out in its twitches that only “the ten tropical storms have preserved the tropical storm or low pressure space 300 km from Phoenix after 1950!
Katrina (1967) was still a hurricane within 65 kilometers from the border of Arizona.”
The latest models of the national hurricane centre predict 50-100 millimetres of rains. The Mogollin harjantee in Arizona can rain up to 150 millimetres.
In other southern desert areas, including central rocks and Great Basin, it will certainly be 25-50 millilitres.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing in the area of drought, if there is no danger of hardening.
Although the floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains can be useful because the southwest has suffered severe drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers of at least extreme drought, which is the second highest class, says Weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa makes its route first landing in the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa's location is 620 kilometres south of Mexico Punta Eugenia, which is still a hurricane's strong wind speed at 135 kilometres per hour. It moves north at 20 kilometres per hour.
The storm loses its power when facing cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico as a powerful tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In some parts of Mexico’s rains can be severe and cause significant flood risk.
"The California Peninsula is expected to be 75-150 millimetres, and up to 250 millimetres is possible," says Weather.com.
Rosa then continues to travel through Mexico as a tropical storm before it arrives at the Arizona border at a tropical low pressure in Tuesday morning hours. From there it continues to travel through Arizona to South Utah by Tuesday.
"The biggest risks of Rosa or its residues are related to very severe rains in the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora and the southwest desert of the United States," says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening severe degradations and waste flows in deserts, as well as land vultures in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton's attack: Four murder attempts
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for a murder attempt after the 16-year-old boy was stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning 4 of Britain.
He was taken to a hospital where he was reported to be in a "stable" state.
The police say that during the night they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man in Radstock in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking for contacts for anyone who may have video material stored on the mobile phone for events.
Trump says Kavanaugh's experienced democratic party's "nasty and anger"
"The voice on behalf of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the disgusting and shameful methods of the democratic party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been suffering from the democratic party’s “religiousness and anger” throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied the accusation of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford, which would have happened decades ago in their teen years.
Ford also proved his accusation in hearing.
On Saturday, the President said "Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, nature and courage" that day.
"The voice on behalf of the confirmation of the name of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote on one of the most earned legal courses of our time with excellent marines for public service," he told his supporters of West Virginia.
Indirectly, the President referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when talking about the importance of the Republican voting activity in the interim elections.
“We are five weeks away from the main elections during our lifetime.
Not just camping, but camping full," he said.
“This is why I recycle everywhere to fight for excellent candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats took over the task of "resisting and preventing".
The senior assistant of the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to be held in the Senate no later than Friday.
In Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, hundreds of dead are expected to rise.
On Saturday, the authorities reported at least 384 dead earthquake and tsunami in the island of Sulawes in Indonesia.
On Friday, there were hundreds of people gathered at the city’s beach, while up to six metres of waves hit the beach in the evening spider. Many of them drowned their deaths when the waves were destroyed in their way.
Tsunam caused 7.5 major earthquakes.
When the threat of tsunami emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately when they were victims of tsunami,” says the Indonesian major accident mitigation agency BNPB reporter Purwo Nugroho Jakarta.
“Tsunami didn’t come alone, but it took cars, trees, houses, and hit all over the country,” says Nugroho. He added that the tsunami reached 800 km of an hour on the open sea before he hit the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing into the trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
The air pictures published by the disaster agency appear to be a number of destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The afterquakes were still shaking the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes appeared in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency BPPT issued an opinion that the energy released in the great earthquake of Friday corresponded to about 200 atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima’s Second World War.
It says that the town’s landscape at the end of the long and narrow Bay could swollen tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had fallen.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims were found in the ruins of repressed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims of death and that the damage could be higher than the Palm 300 kilometres north of the constant coast of Donggala, which is closer to the center of shock.
The communication connections “are completely broken and no information has been obtained from Donggala” says Nugroho.
According to the statement given by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticized for not telling the tsunami hit the return, but the authorities said that the waves arrived during the warning.
In a social media amateur video, a man in the upper floor of the building shouts strongly warnings of the coming tsunami for people on the street.
Just minutes later, the beach is hit by a water wall that takes buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn’t immediately prove the authenticity of the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large electrical breakdown that cut off communications from around, please, which made it difficult to coordinate the rescue measures by the authorities.
The authorities say that the army has started to send help from Jakarta and other cities with transportation machines, but the evacuated ones still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been reopened only for aid operations and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The victims of Indonesian tsunami exceed 800.
The situation is really bad.
The Donggala staff of World Vision have access to safety, please, the city where they are accommodationd in the tent roofs in the interior of the office. On their way they passed the scene of the destruction, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is really bad.
When the assistance groups started their unsatisfactory task, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from traveling to the Return.
According to Indonesia’s regulations, foreign funding, equipment and staff can only begin to flow when the area of accident has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
“It still has a regional disaster,” says Aulia Arriani, an informant of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says "OK, this is a national disaster," we can begin to receive international assistance, but the declaration has not yet been made."
When the second night landed Please after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family members of the lost hoped that their loved ones’ miracles would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was lifted from the bathroom.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indoneesian Societies team, had trained two caterpillars for the Asian races that ended earlier this month.
The Roa Roa hotel also trapped her students, says Mandagi.
"I have my own emotional burden as an older member of the line," he says.
Gendon says he tried desperately to reach the beach festival participants Please competitors on WhatsApp messages after the news of Roa Roa's repression spread among the dependent community.
However, only one grey sign appeared after the messages he sent instead of two blues.
“This means that I understand that messages are not received,” he says.

Kanye West: The Flyer Changes Ye
The bomber Kanye West changes his name Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "a character known as Kanye West."
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album published in June.
The change precedes his future performance in the Saturday Night Live program, where he is expected to publish his new album called Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who, according to the creator, canceled his participation for "sensitive reasons".
West has previously told him that the word also has religious significance to him, in addition to the fact that it is a shortening of his professional name.
Talking about the name of the album earlier this year with the radio broadcaster Big Boy, West said, "he believes that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you".
“I am you, we, and we are all.
It started from Kanya, which means the only ones, and ended up in a shorter form of Ye - which only manifests the goodness, evil, confusion in us, everything.
The album is mainly about who we are.”
He is one of many well-known wrestlers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known differently as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his favourite names for Love and Brother Love.
West’s former partner JAY-Z has also removed and restored the link and large letters.
AMLO promised not to use military against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, promised that he would never use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, promised not to use an army to oppress the people of Mexico.
The armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people during the time when left student movements were rooting in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young people in Mexico by providing monthly study support and opening more free public universities.
He said that lack of unemployment and training opportunities lead young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence research
The United States should double the funding they use to investigate artificial intelligence when China enhances its activity in the field. This is what says the sponsor and artist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The opinion was preceded by notifications of the various parts of the US administration, although the US lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be the leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The duplication of the budget of the intelligence study would be a good start when it was noted that the other countries were so much behind the United States, and that we were looking for the next breakthrough of artificial intelligence," says Lee.
Duplication of funding could double the likelihood that the following significant artificial intelligence would be carried out in the United States, Lee said in this week’s CNBC interview.
Leen’s book “The Great Powers of Arts: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO at Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of the most important China’s artificial intelligence companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system in the Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the U.S. highest ranked Othello player. He later worked in Microsoft Research’s management tasks as well as Google’s leading Chinese operations.
Lee acknowledged the previous technology competitions of the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next would be organized to identify future visionaires.
Lee says U.S. researchers worked hard to get public assistance.
"Academic influencers are not taking China, but large companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited universities in recent years to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up their intellectual efforts.
"I think that doctoral graduates of artificial intelligence should automatically grant green cards," he said.
The Chinese Government Council of the next generation of artificial intelligence development plans in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation grants funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Scientific Foundation and other State Organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
The United States Department of Defence was founded earlier this year by the Defense Department of Artificial Intelligence Center, which was designed to bring together industrial and academic partners. The White House has also announced the formation of a special committee of artificial intelligence.
DARPA was also announced this month about $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
In turn, NSF invests in artificial intelligence over $100 million per year.
At the same time, the legislative initiative on the establishment of the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not advanced for months.
Macedonian referendum amending the name of the country
In the Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country as "the Republic of North Macedonia". The change of name would solve the dispute with Greece that lasted for decades, which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The name of the North Neighbourhood is in practice a regional requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its access to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments concluded a new nominal proposal, but nationalists believe that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and that the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether voting activity reaches the required 50% limit in order to make the result legal.
The question in the voting flag was: “Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev suggest that the price should be paid so that Macedonia, which has risen from the collapse of Yugoslavia, could strive to be a member of both the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, on behalf of the young people of Macedonia, in order to live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” Olivera Georgijevska Skopje said.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive impact.
This will require a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Board at 13 no irregularities were reported.
However, the voting activity was only 16, compared to 34% of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, and 66% of the voters finally voted.
“I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum on the change of name in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54-year-old, prepared a small stage and put a referendum on the front of the tents set by boikotoivates in front of the Skopje Parliament.
"We're going to take NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads upright, and not through the kitchen door, said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to another one, such as China and Russia as part of the integration of the euro area.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership is bringing missing investments in Macedonia with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe a large majority will vote for a change in name because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said, "Yes," the voice is "failing our future."
The opinion survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research on Monday referred to 30-43% voting activity in the referendum, i.e. less than the required activity.
In the second survey by the Terma TV, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for the yes option.
In order to succeed in the referendum, voting activity must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious retreat to the Western government after it came into power in May of last year.
See: Manchester City Sergio Aguero defeated the entire Brighton defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made clear evidence of Brighton's defence at Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At 65 minutes, Aguero made the goal to look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the picture, the Argentine top player received an input from the middle field.
He found an empty space on the field by attacking three Brighton defenders through.
Then Aguero noticed that she was surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed out of one defender and then left behind several others on the edge of the Brighton punishment area.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the punishment area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton watch Mathew Ryan's goal on the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists that "Aguero has problems with his legs."
“We said he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he made a goal in that time.”
However, Sterling had already given the skyspeakers an advantage in the election struggle.
The paint came with 29 game minutes.
Aguero got the ball in a deep Brighton area.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful penetration on the left side.
Sane took a few touches before he sent the ball to the back of Sterling.
The Heaven Blue Attack kicked the ball on the net just before the end limit.

Scherzer wants to be a cheerful fight against Rockies.
The Nationals are out of a drop-off fight, so why are you forced to try to start a meeting?
However, Scherzer always hopes to take over the feed gum in the Sunday match against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a drop game. They have a single win difference in the Los Angeles Dodgers Western series.
Rockies picked up at least a wild card with 5-2 wins from Nationals on Friday night, but they still aim at their first division win.
“Whether we don’t have a stake, we can at least get up to the feedkum, knowing that the atmosphere of the public and the second team’s holiday here in Denver creates the most demanding competitive arrangements I’ve faced this year.
Why would I not want to meet the challenge?”
Nationals have not yet published their beginner for Sunday, but they are inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity in these circumstances.
Scherzer throws a session on Thursday. He would play 34 at the start of his game and feed on Sunday at his normal rest shift.

Trump Campaign in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the Republican voting activity in the interim elections.
“All our achievements are in the game in November.
We are five weeks away from the main elections during our lifetime.
This is one of the really big ones -- not just campaigning, but campaigning full, and so I'm going all over the world to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They have decided to return to the power of whatever means you can see their evils and evil desires.
They do not choose who will harm, or who will have to browse, so that they may gain power. That is what they want, power and power, but we will not give it to them.”
He said that the Democrats took up the task of "resisting and preventing".
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "to be angry and evil and false."
When he referred to his name as the longest dictator of the Senate Judicial Committee, Dianne Feinstein, the public responded with a loud buoyant.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Eh, uh, what?
Well, no, I'll wait a bit - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Work is no longer a tolerance congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions
I’m not really surprised when the Momentum activists supported the distrust statement against me.
I am, at least, only the last last representative of the workforce, who is told that I am not welcome - just because we say our opinions.
My parliamentary collega Joan Ryan was treated in the same way only because he was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the distrust statement was a criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Subjects related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference said on Friday that “we want our meetings to be participatory and productive.”
Most of the eight years I have been a representative of the local Labour, the Fridays of the Party Council have been just that.
Now, many meetings do not follow that sound, and “friendly and more gentle” policy has been forgotten a long time ago if it even started.
It is clearer that the Labour Party no longer tolerates divergent opinions, and that each opinion is evaluated on the basis of whether it is suitable for the party or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, with colleagues with whom I thought I had shared the same political view, began to expect me from a full turn and statements that I would never have agreed to, whether it was national security or the internal market of the EU.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I'm saying - the result of an offensive belt in social media that requires my choice to be canceled, the rejection of central policy, and I can hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I really know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments made to me are of a political nature.
I greatly respect the professionality and determination of my colleagues who face sexistic and racist insults every day, and never deteriorate.
The normalization of Kalto treatment is one of the most disturbing features of the policy of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corby demanded that the Labour Party adopt the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party accepting different opinions, and with each statement of confidence or change of choice, the party becomes only more limited.
For two years, I have been urged to keep a low profile and stay away from expressing my thoughts so that everything is going well.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of non-compliance with the Single School of the Government of Thatcher, I am both a city authority and in the minister’s duties to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I have never covered my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East election district could be surprised by my views or disagreements with my current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the state moves towards the brexit that hampers households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my trust in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with honor, and the threat of separation or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible Ayr block arm
The last two goals were slightly distorted by the outcome of the match, but without contradicting, Ayr earned a win in a fun Tennent's Premiership game.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten who have not lost any match.
Excellent defense and more successful risk-taking was ultimately what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie could be happy for a reason.
“We have been challenged in our matches and we are still unbeatable, so I can be happy.”
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All honors to Ayri, they took risks better than us."
At 14 minutes, Ayr took the lead at Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful converzió shot, but the Scottish Captain Roy Hughes, who gave the Warriors to the match, was able to increase Melrose's yellow card, and Jason Baggot made a goal.
Climo raised the leadership of Ayri in the penal painting, and just before the half time he made the goal and succeeded in the conversion shot, raising the Ayri leadership to the 17-5.
But Melrose started a second round well with Patrick Anderson’s goal, which in the converse kick Baggot managed to reduce the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and picked out of the field. As Ayr continued, Ayr raised his lead on the goal of Stafford McDowall, whose conversion hit Climo succeeded.
Ayri's Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine made a hard-pressure goal that the converse kick failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for slotless Climo, and Macpherson made a goal behind Ayri's painting.
Climo succeeded in the converse kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's kick and forced Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal of the home team.

The bases of the fleet from Titicaca to Amazon have been stacked by the attack sentence: “The sea is rightly ours.
Recovery is our duty.”
Inside the Bolivia, the memory of Chile’s bloody war in the 18th century is still strong – as well as the trailing of the Pacific Ocean once again.
The hope is highest for decades when Bolivia expects the International Court to decide on October 1, after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has a strong progress, co-hension and insistence, and of course a positive attitude in waiting for a final solution," said Bolivia diplomat Roberto Calzad.
Several Bolivians around the country follow the International Court's decision on large screens, hoping that in the end of the decades of the debate, the Bolivia has a duty to grant the Bolivia independent access to the sea.
The Bolivian charismatic president, Evo Morales, who faces the reelection of the contested struggle next year, has a lot to play in the next Monday line.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is likely not to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it is decided, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch institution does not have the power to dispose of Chile’s administrative areas, and ICJ has also announced that it does not prescribe the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that only six months after the final statements of the ICJ decision refers to the fact that the case is not complex, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivian goals.
“The current Bolivian government has abducted the question of maritime connection,” said Zárate.
The retourism that challenged Morales has suppressed the rest of the charity of the Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue discussions at some point, but it is very difficult to organise negotiations afterwards.
Neither country has been a second embassy since 1962.
The former President and representatives of Bolivia in Haagi, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the opinion that the Court’s decision would have been exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era in relationships with Chile" and the opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzad also argues that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the maritime issue as political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to contact with the Pacific Ocean,” she added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea announced that the nuclear assault will not happen unless it can trust the United States
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first, unless they can trust Washington, said North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the US to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin's position came just before the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo was re-starting with the nuclear weapons of the deadly diplomacy, only three months after the United States met Kim Jong Unin in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "distort dream" to believe that the continued sanctions and the U.S. opposition to the Korean War End Declaration would bring North Korea on their knees.
Before Pjongjang has first taken significant measures on weapons to promote withdrawal, Washington will be guarded in the adoption of the declaration.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, the view that Pjongjang would intend to give up the arsenal, which the state is likely to see as the only real means to guarantee its own security, has gained a broad range of doubts.
Pompeo is going to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris's fashion shows present the most recent model's big-sized headlines, which will soon be on your next street.
If you want to increase your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not need to continue searching.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 model display a range of special super-sized heads that would ruin the style circles of Paris's fashion Mondays.
This summer, the very unpractical heads conquered Instagram, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to the fashion screens.
Valentino’s most spectacular creation was a beige hat with a wide feather, covering the heads of the models almost completely.
Other over-sized accessories were, among other things, water melons decorated with jewelry, wizard hats and even ananas – but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of isolated masks – just right before Halloween.
In several colorful masks, the lips were occupied, and they reminded Hannibal Lecter more than the top fashion.
One of the creations with a snorcle and mask reminded me of a more submarine, and the other reminded me of the sealed ice cream.
And if you want to take a position for a large-sized fashion, you were lucky.
Fashion followers predict that huge scarves will appear in the street picture.
Excessive sizes of hats are strictly followed by "La Bombaa", a strawberry hat with half a metre of lingerie, which has been seen from Rihana to Emily Ratajkowski.
In the social media, the cult of an unpractical hat that appeared abundantly, also embedded another sized creativity into the fashion displays – a beach bag made from the shoulder, which is almost as large as the model bearing it.
A raffle bar with a burned orange decoration was the most spectacular creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 model in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I suppose I see large sizes of hats and beach traps in the street picture next summer – designers have made such a great impression that it would be difficult to ignore demand for large-sized clothing.”
John Edward: language skills are the key skills of the world citizen
The study results of Scottish private schools have been traditionally good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good results. Success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of more than 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools SCIS, seek to provide a high level of service for their students and the parents of students.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for their chosen careers, postgraduate and higher education, as well as for the world citizenship.
As a training operator that can design and implement customized content, we have noticed the status of languages as a popular and hoped learning material in the educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in the language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you talk to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to create relationships with people in other countries.
The latest results of this year note that languages are at the top of the lists for the percentage of access between private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest rating A.
The material was collected from 74 schools belonging to SCIS. Based on the material it was found that students who received the best grade A, 72% of students in mandarin Chinese, 72% of students in German, 69% of students in French and 63% of students in Spanish.
This shows that Scottish private schools support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages are currently free-selling substances, but they are regarded as the same value as natural sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private schools study program and elsewhere.
On the basis of the survey conducted by the UK Employment Office in 2014, 17% of the situations in which the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee’s job were explained with a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary to promote career development for young people in the future.
The more possible work tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills are formed in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he will have an advantage in the future from this lifelong skill, despite what career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically put a language-skilled person in front of the competition.
According to the survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, over 4,000 adults in Isobritannia are unable to talk in a foreign language, and France was the only language that was part of a two-digit figure of 15%.
This is why it is important to contribute to teaching languages for current children.
In particular, knowing the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance to find a meaningful career.
In Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are supposed to be important to the big British in 2020, such as mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, private schools always have a number of language options taught by specialist teachers.
The Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and prepares them with skills necessary for success, whatever the future brings.
In this time, it cannot be denied that international business languages are still very important for the future of the country, so this must reflect on education.
Today’s languages should be seen as “international communication skills”.
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high-level Scotland youths.
Il faut bien is faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Private Schools SCIS
LeBron makes a debyyt on Sunday in San Diego
LeBron James's first visit to Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Coach Luke Walton of Lakers has announced that James plays against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the beginning of the season.
But how many minutes he really plays, stay to see.
“It will be more than one, and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers’ official website.
Mike Trudell, Lakers' journalist, twittered that James is probably playing indefinite minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six matches to be played through Lakers.
“In this stage, my career doesn’t need any more pre-treatment to prepare,” he said.
Time for the Trump Western Virginia campaign, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will launch a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling in West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first five next week electoral events, including condolences such as Tennesse and Mississippi.
When the vote awaits his choice to fill the free position of the Supreme Court judge, Trump is seeking to increase support for future interim elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing the majority of the Congress in November elections.
What time is Trump’s Western Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
The event of Trump West Virginia Wheeling begins at 19 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September8.
You can watch Trump’s Western Virginia campaign event online as a livestock trip through YouTube by clicking below.
Trump will have to refer to the hearing of Judge Brett Kavanaugh of this week's Supreme Court, who became accused of intense sexual harassment, which has delayed the Senate's confirmation vote at the time of a week in the investigation of the FBI.
But the primary objective for the campaign series is to support the success of the Republican candidates in tight November elections.
Therefore, the campaign of President Trump was commented on the purpose of the five events of the next week to "wake volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
“Government of the Congress is so essential for his purpose that the President is ready to travel to as many states as possible during the busy campaign season,” Trump’s unnamed representative told Reuters.
Today’s event is located in Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and there can be arriving by West Virginia Metro News, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent units in 2016.
Trump supports the Republican Senator election candidate Patrick Morrisey of the Republicans in Western Virginia, who has remained after the opinion measurements.
"For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president is trying to raise his support for opinion measurements," said State scientist Simon Haeder from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows battle to keep hope up before Sunday's single games
After the three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon four games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-reinforcing power of success is a fully invented phenomenon in sport, players believe it, and even more in tournaments like this.
Where is this success power now?
"They had a six-point leadership position, which fell to four, so we take this success power as a hip," Jordan Spieth said when he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage: four points above and 12 to be played.
The Americans, as Spieth said, experience that they have a little wind in the sailings and a lot of encouragement, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas, which helped them play together all day and got three points out of four.
Spieth has been overwhelming from the road to the green, and leads to an example.
The thick cucumbers of the winning party became stronger when his round progressed when he succeeded in a critical tube to balance the match to four, when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
Putt, in which they won the 15th match, followed a similar scream that gave us the idea that he believed that the U.S. team has not yet lost.
“You need to focus very well and take care of your own match,” Spieth said.
This is the only thing that these players have left now.
18 holes to make an effect.
The only players who have gained more points when Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cupin's uncontroversial legends of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special, but the sweet twin has won four of four inevitably.
"Moliwood" was the only twin that didn't make any bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this rude audience, confirms that they are the prior recommendations of Sunday. And when the sun drops in Le Golf National, the second most popular player in Europe to ensure the potential victory could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I prefer both at the same time with different holes.
However, speeches on European success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly flourished with Alex Noren, the Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the four-star game in the morning.
One bogi and two double bogia in the first nine holes were so deep that the Spanish and Swedish were not close to survival.
On Sunday, no one will help you out of the hole.
Four balls and four games are fascinating to follow closely from the point of view of collaboration with couples: what kind of advice they give or miss it and how the strategy can change in the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant leadership position before the last day, but this quadruple showed that the US team has a battle desire, even though it has been suspected in the United States.
Europe takes 10-6 lead before Ryder Cup's last day
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup after they took 10-6 leadership positions from the United States in Saturday's four-balls and four-games.
The great double Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led a win in two wins from Tiger Woods, and scored four points today in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side, who worked hard to keep the win in Hazeltine two years ago, controlled a weakly played U.S. team in the morning’s four-ball game at 3-1.
The United States was a harder opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow down the leadership position.
Jim Furyk's half needed eight points from Sunday 12 to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner that has won four points in success. He and Molinari, also called "Malliwood", were the second double in Ryder Cup's history after the sensational weekend, which has won four points in the first four games.
After the four balls of Woods and Patrick Reed, they finished overwhelmingly Woods and the U.S. beginner Bryson Dechambeau even more than 5-4.
Woods, who barely survived through two matches on Saturday, was sometimes very great, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four games, and up to 7 consecutives.
Justin Rose rested the four balls in the morning, but returned with Henrik Stenson to a four-game game, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are the first and third in the ranking.
Europe did not get everything in the way he wanted this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to Southwest.
Triple prize winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the United States at two points on Saturday.
They acquire 2-1 wins from the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls, and later 4-3 wins from Poulter and Rory McIlroy in four games, however, lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, the team has risen from four points of drive to levels when double games begin, even though on Fury's side of the line is enough to preserve winning.
However, two days after the second, the best may be that the Sunday attack has been too much requested.
North Korea “Not in any name” takes off its own weapons without trust
On Saturday, the North Korea Foreign Minister told the United Nations that constant sanctions only increased the uncertainty of the United States, and in these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken “significant good-will measures” over the last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promised that North Korea would not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technologies.
“We haven’t seen the same gesture from the United States,” he said.
"We cannot be sure of the US's trust in national security, so in such circumstances, it is not possible to take ourselves out of weapons unilaterally."
Although Ri reiterated the familiar appeal stream of Washington's rejection of phased nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for every intermediate topic, his statement is, however, significant in the sense that unilateral weapons were not completely excluded, as Pjongjang has previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first US summit of the President and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, Kim convinced him that "the Korean Peninsula was taking off nuclear weapons" and Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought to officially decide the Korean War between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pjongjang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States demand "the nuclear stripping first", and have raised pressures through sanctions to achieve their goals in force – even opposing the "resolution"," Ri said.
"The explicit that the sanctions will bring us to our knees is an uninterested wish.
But the problem is that constant sanctions only deepen our uncertainty."
Ri did not mention the plans for the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings with the South Korean Director Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the party who wants to take weapons would be South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed in such a deadlock."
However, the voice of Ri was significantly different from last year when he said at the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles in the United States towards continental regions was inevitable after the "evil President" Trump called Kim as a "kim" missile.
In the last year, Trump threatened the "destroy completely" of North Korea. This year, however, Trump insisted on Kim’s boldness to approach the resignation of weapons, but pointed out that there is still a lot left to work and sanctions should remain for as long as North Korea resigns from nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he has no time limit: “If it lasts two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should be rewarded for the progress already made by Pjongjang.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the strengthening of the sanctions of the Security Council should continue to be strong and failing until we prove the complete, final and reinforced release of nuclear weapons.”
The Security Council has unanimously enhanced sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of breaking down the financing channels for the production of Pjongjang ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Pompeo met at the UN General Assembly of the North Korean Rin, and also announced to visit Pjongjang next month for preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pjongjang, he described the progress. However, North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsterical requirements" just a few hours later.
North Korea committed to the closure of the missile base and nuclear facility in the meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month in the case of the United States taking "conforming measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "requiring measures" security guarantees to which Trump committed to meeting Singapore and moving towards the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students perform an adequate course of rest guidance
All graduate students at the University of Harvard will participate in this year’s course aimed at increasing student rest. The course is a counterattack to the university’s flourishing machoculture, where students will weigh a long night with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students of the world’s best university are often quite ignorant of their own well-being issues.
The course was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler of the University of Harvard Medical Faculty of Medicine, working on a sleeping study in Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first of his species in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for the course after he lectured on the effect of sleeping shortages on learning.
“After the lecture, a young woman came to me, who said, “Why do I hear it only now, as my last year of study?”
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising,” he said in the interview with Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course guides students how the right uniformities support academic and sports performances and improve overall well-being.
Professor of the University of Harvard Medical Faculty and Vice-President of the University of Health Services Paul Barreira says the university has ended up organising a course after they had heard how students suffer serious sleep shortages during the study week.
The hourly course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented a picture of the apartment room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus obtain information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deficiency on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
“We know that this has no immediate effect on students’ behavior.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these things in the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," Professor Czeisler added.
Throughout the night-long studyumaratons are still the subject of pride, according to professor Czeisler, and modern technology and students’ ever growing pressures made a growing problem of sleep shortage.
"Acquiring enough and high-quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" against students' stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against weight gain, because sleep shortage causes a famine in the brain, which is why a person is constantly hungry," the professor notes.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical psychology student, helped professor Czeisler to plan a course after he had attended one of his teaching courses in Harvard last year.
He says the course opened his eyes and made an incision for all campus students to organize a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all graduates could complete a similar study set before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set a awakening clock to remind you of sleeping time in addition to morning awakening, and urges them to keep in mind the side effects caused by electronic display equipment and LED lighting "blue light" to day-to-day rhythms, which can make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga shot took a win from Gerrardi players
Steven Gerrard and Rangers had another defeated day again when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston 1 to 0 wins.
The players of Ibrox were seeking their first win after February 4-1 of the game that was held against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt’s team took the victory this time, and Gerrard only experienced his second defeat during his career of 18 game managers. Rangers remained eight points away from the current head of the valioliiga.
Menga shot the ball to the goal of seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers failed to fight afterwards no longer balanced the situation.
Rangers fell to the sixth place as a result of the game. Livingston has climbed to the third place, and the goal difference is only above Hibernia.
Rangers may have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game by hitting the object thrown in the head, and the wound had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight shifts to the assembly, where the team had hit Ayri and progressed to the Scottian League semificials.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 collection, where the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again produced results when the well-built composition managed to dismantle the opponent in almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better to use the situations for its own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to get the goal at two minutes, when the first feeding of Menga gave Scott Pittman a free way to the goal of Allan McGregor. However, Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free shot to Craig Halkett, but another defendant Alan Lithgow managed to shoot him widely in the back.
On the other hand, Rangers took control of the game, but the last third of the game was no longer self-confidence.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when at 15 minutes he and Steven Lawless had encountered each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored Colombia's requests.
Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox's goalkeeper Liam Kelly rejected the unsuccessful shot of Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejarian.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the hard work of the team.
Rangers still couldn’t do anything about Jacobs’ long feed tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher emitted Scott Robinson, who was coldly able to get the ball to Menga for easy paint.
At the change time, Gerrard decided to change Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The change affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable hole for Morelos. However, the attack broke Kelly’s impact on rapid defence.
Livingston made visitors play their own game again when Lithgow and Halkett continued long feeds for each other.
The Holt team had the opportunity to increase its leadership at the last moments of the game. However, McGregor’s fine defense prevented Jacobs’ intentions before Lithgow got to his positions in the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who was exchanged by Rangers, also demanded a retreat after having taken together with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanakka: Geigermeter inventor
Next page of our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882. John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physicist, was born today in Germany 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The engineering later led to the development of a known device as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the support pillars of science, and also the main concept of pop culture. For example, the film "Coronado watches" published in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are performing scientists who seem to be quite a shepherd:
"What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter. It's used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals."
Evans: “Look, it really is!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
An invention that bears his name still lives.
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
In the method, resistance cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory
After processing, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ for several cancers with typical proteins
The dog test has shown promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, the cancer cells of the patients with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” typical HER2 proteins for several cancers. In the end, converted cells are injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, the National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, describes the method: "On the basis of our results, this vaccine is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "Controls the growth of multiple types of cancer", Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer and eggs, lungs and thick bowels eating."
A similar approach – taking resistance cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also resulted in a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West got into critics' teeth after praised by Trumpia Saturday Night Live, a campaign hat in his head.
The show didn't go according to the plans
Kanye West received a bouquet in the Saturday Night Live entertainment program, praised by the brutal style of President Donald Trump and announced to be president in the 2020 elections.
After his third song "Ghost Town", Trump's Make America's Great Again Championship, West attacked the Democrats and repeated his support to President Trump.
“After discussing a white man, they ask me how I can support Trump because he’s a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
The broadcast of the evening began with a sketches in which Matt Damon dismissed Brett Kavanaugh's consultation in the Senate Justice Committee. The consultation is related to the claims made by Christine Blasey Ford by Kavanaugh.
West's fasting was not presented in a direct shipment, but the comic Chris Rock downloaded it to the social media.
It is unclear whether Rock's aiming to mock West by posting.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been treated in the sculptures because of the hat he had kept in his head.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat in my head.
I've been tempted!
Then they say I'm in the margin," West says in the Washington Examiner interview.
West continues, "Do you want to see what being in the margin means?" and says you're dressing up for a Superman's reference, because "Sometimes you can't order my actions. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
According to Variet, West's comments shouted the buffets from the public at least twice, and the performers of the show seemed embarrassed. One of the presents described the situation for the newspaper as follows: "All the studio went completely quiet."
West was selected to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by showing the song "I love it" as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from the head of the Conservative TPUSA Organization, Candace Turner, who praised this courage on Twitter: "WITH HOW TO FREE THE CHILDREN".
But Karen Hunter, the director of the discussion program, said that West was “only self, which is all of a wonderful one.”
"I can, however, decide to be a person (buying this music or wardrobe or supporting this "art" which I believe supports and spreads harmful ideology for my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us," he added.
Prior to his presentation on Twitter, the sniper announced that he changed his name as "a person who was previously known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician is following Diddy here, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The second rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the former music legend Prince, who changed his name into a symbol and later known as a artist, known as Prince.
Belfast's restaurant pussy gets accused of a murder attempt
A 45-year-old man is accused of a murder attempt after he was stabbed on Friday at the restaurant in Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in the area of Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to be charged before the Belgian court on Monday.
The accusation will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Actor star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for a sword from his sparkling hero role in the violent fantasy series of Jon Snow'na HBO.
However, Harrington has attacked machosankar’s stereotype: according to the 31-year-old actress, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect should be earned with durableness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Harrington suspects that “something has gone wrong” and questiones the means in place to address toxic maskulicity in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Harrington, who has recently been married to the Star Guard of the throne game, also with Rose Leslie, who is 31, admits that he has a strong desire to intervene.
“The question of where we have been wrong with masculinity is now arousing strong emotions in me,” he says.
What has been taught to men in years of their growth, which has led to problems that can now be seen?
Harrington believes that TV and its very maskuline characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic maskulicity.
He continues: “What is the inner birth and what is it that has been learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel that they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the major issues of our time – how can we change this?
“Young men have something really wrong.”
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the Championships or postparts after the series ends next summer, because he has said that he has made enough of battlefields and horses.
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard’s Play True West, who tells about the film producer and his robbery brother.
Recently, the actor revealed that dating his future wife Rose was the best thing that the throne game has offered him.
“I met my wife in this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on,” she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, Harrington's show of Jon Snow's love in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 with the holdings of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: The number of new infections has increased by 14% in China
China has reported an increase in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens by 14%.
According to health authorities, the virus affects more than 820 000 lives in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has rapidly spread through blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities in the Yunnan County conference, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
However, a year later, the number of HIV-infected and AIDS-infected people in China has increased by 100,000 cases.
HIV infections through sex are an acute question in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBTs has been reported to be general.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are married to women due to the conservative values of the country.
Many diseases are caused by insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to ensure the overall availability of HIV medicines as part of the action to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the information of the employee who leaked on the Republicanist and accuses the dissemination of "dangerous lies" and "salarial theories"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. representative room, Maxine Waters objected to claims that his employees had published personal information about three republicans on Wikipedia’s websites.
Democratic representative from Los Angeles confirmed that the objections were distributed by "extremists" commentators and websites.
"Walths, lies and more deceptive lies," says Waters in a statement published on Twitter.
It is reported that the Senator Lindsey Graham and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, who represent the state of Utah, represents South Carolina.
The unknown person published information on Thursday from the US Congress in the course of the consultation of the Senate Committee, concerning the accusations of sexual abuse against the candidate Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred a little after three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, report that the messages were published by the IP address connected to Waters office and by the person belonging to Waters staff.
"This unjustified accusation is completely wrong and it's absolute lies," Water continued.
"My employee whose identity, personal data and security have compromised due to these sincere and false accusations is not in any form responsible for leaking these data.
This unjustified accusation is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters’ opinion quickly received criticism on the Internet, and the critics also included the former secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denys this is very hostile," Fleischer wrote.
“It seems that his nature is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostile.
There's no reason for destructiveness.
There is no reason to question the motives of the prosecutor.
Behaviour should be modest and calm in the situation."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's consultation.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes from Waters in the Congress interim elections, has also expressed its views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true," he said.
Waters announced in his opinion that he was contacting "the relevant authorities and law enforcement bodies for these sincere accusations.
“We make sure that the authors will be revealed,” he continued, “and that they will be legally held accountable for all the disastrous and dangerous activities against some or all of my staff members.”
Johnny English hits again – a low-powered Rowan Atkinson agent parod
The tradition has already been established to search for brexit references to any of the British movies, but this does not seem to be suitable for Johnny English agent industry, and the series of action, which started in 2003 on the Johnny English rain and revived back to the “Johnny English – Newborn”.
Can the language of the nation's satires in cheek become a new UK national export success?
Thus or so, a stubborn-eyed, rubbery and incompetent Johnny English has earned his permission to repeat it. Jo his name says, above all, that it is a comic creation that is aimed at the outside of the English-language film market.
Of course, it's the stubborn secret agent who desperately tries to live around a melting glamour, but appears as a mix of inspector Clouseau, Mr. Beani, and the unhappy single musician in the London 2012 opening concert.
As the basis of the character, the cosmopolit and mystical world man, who was originally presented by Atkinson in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads.
The latest show has its moments.
I particularly liked the scene where Johnny English arrives on the helicopter as a medieval armor, and the stages of the roottor smash his helmet.
Atkinson’s physical comedy gifts come out, but the humor itself seems to be under-efficient and strange, especially because “standing” film brands, such as 007 and Dangerous task, now offer humor as part of the main content of the film.
The humor seems to be directed to children, and Johnny English's crazy treatment doesn't seem to me as inventive and sharp-looking as a comedy of Atkinson's Mr. Bean's mysterious roles.
Every year, the starting point is that the United Kingdom is a worse time in trouble.
The cyber hacker is infiltrated into the UK’s top secret spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents on the field as an atrocities of an agent serving – which is presented as Kevin Eldon’s unfortunately small role.
This is the last drop to the prime minister of importance and stack, who is already ready for his ears, in the vein of political discomfort: Emma Thompson does everything in the skin of Teresa May, but the manuscript does not only provide him enough space.
When the intelligence advisers inform him that all the spy on the field has been revealed, someone who has already moved away from the active service must be called into a hurry.
It is, of course, a tunare Johnny English in his own personality. He spends his retirement days as a teacher at a fine school, but at the same time gives unofficial lessons in the noble skills of spying. The subject excites some smart jokes; English keeps the School of Rock-type lessons in the field of intelligence.
English will be congratulated to the emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he meets his endless patient partner, Bough, who is still acting by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine who plays the role of Vicki Pepperdine doesn’t seem to have access to his rights.
Thus, the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service to face the fate super-criminal Ophelia Bhuletova, acting by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is becoming manipulated by the charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, acting by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve the UK's computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough is transformed to the farss of the way: the twin that is masked as waiters will light a fine French restaurant and causes chaos in the search for the luxury yachts of Volta. The company to explore Volta’s house with virtual glasses will end up in a pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last obstacles of the authors will go to the final scene, but despite all powerlessness and charming, the film still feels a little bit made to the child’s public.
The movie can be considered moderate.
When I watched Johnny English movies, I’ve decided to think about the same thing before: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week with five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn's work is considering a radical plan that British people would work for four days a week, but they would pay for five days.
The Party is told to require business leaders to transfer the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers in the form of extra leisure days.
The plan suggests that employees could enjoy three-day weekends at the same wage.
According to the sources, the idea of “sop” the party’s economic programme and its plans to cost politics for the benefit of the workers.
The Central Organisation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day work week as a means to help workers benefit from a changing economic situation.
The source of the High Level Workers Party tells the Sunday Times: "Acts of reviewing the distribution were announced before the change of the year.
The change will not take place in the moment, but the four-day work week is the objective of the party’s approach to economic balancing for workers and the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the British Green Party committed to supporting the transition to a four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective must not be undistributed in the labour line.
The reporter of the Labour Party notes: "The four-day working week is not the party's line, and the party is not considering such a shift."
Mr John McDonnell, Minister of Finance of the Shadow Government, used the work conference held last week to present his vision on the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from "growing dictators" and "trainers of general interest" companies.
According to the plans of the Minister of Finance of the Shadow Government, the current shareholders of the water companies should not return their share as a whole because the government led by the Labour could implement "reducations" on the basis of the abuses observed.
He also confirmed the plans to set employees into corporate management units and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of private sector equity capital to employees’ management, according to the plan, to pay up to 500 pounds per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss in the 60-minute program whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh's investigation on the accusation of charges has delayed at least a week's final vote on Kavanaugh's appointment as judge of the Supreme Court.
In the 60-minute period to be sent on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked the Republican Party for Senates John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could be possible for the FBI to find out the things they could change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said by the time I heard you... I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the accusations came out, and I asked him, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Instead, Graham's voice appears to be a stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's a bomb safe," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett denied it dramatically," Graham added Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one of the people he named could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see what could change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival held in New York is a music event with a display card as impressive as its mission: the elimination of poverty from the world.
The Global Citizen Festival is now hosting tens of thousands of people in New York Central Park lawns to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make the real goal of the event known: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 is a follow-up to the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aimed at removing poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to eliminate poverty.
To get a free ticket to an event (if it is not willing to pay the VIP ticket), the public must perform a variety of tasks or "works" such as volunteer work, send an e-mail to the political decision-makers or make a call, or perform another act that spreads awareness of the objectives of the project.
But how has the Global Citizen succeeded now that there are 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of a free concert ticket a real way of persuading people to take action, or is it only one ‘clictivism’ among others — an idea that the world can be changed by signing a web address or sending a TV?
The Global Citizen announces his book on behalf of more than 19 million different objectives since 2011.
According to it, these actions have encouraged policy makers to report commitments and principles equivalent to more than $37 billion, which have been used in a way that affects more than 2.25 billion people’s lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements on the basis of which more than $10 billion has already been used or collected.
The group estimates that the funds achieved have already had an impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, the Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in the United Kingdom, committed to “to help children develop their potential.” The group committed to delivering $35 million to Rwanda to end the undernutrition in the country. This happened after activists had sent them 4,700 TV as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, the governments of different countries, and just the world citizens like you, we can transfer social injustice and undernutrition to the history of the history of the history of the history of society," Tracey Ulman, ambassador of Power of Nutrition, said to the public at the concert held in London in 2018.
According to the group, the UK government was also invited to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by more than 5 000 actions. The government has published the Power focusing on the fight against undernutrition, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions often asked on the website of the movement is: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global citizen’s answer: “It becomes long and difficult and many combustion stones are ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as major civil rights struggles and movements against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger.”
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman run the New York concert this year, and its star map includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Interior, the country can make energy exports difficult by using the Navy as a "prevention"
According to Washington Examiner, American Minister Ryan Zinke of Interior, Washington can “if necessary” rely on its fleet to help prevent Russian energy from spreading on the world market, including the nearest ones.
Zinke argues that Russia’s activities in Syria – a call from the legal government – are an excuse for the recognition of the new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the reason for the presence of [Russia] in the Middle East is energy transmission, just like in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," Zinken said.
According to the authority, there are ways and means to prevent this.
"The United States have the ability to keep the shipping routes open by using their fleet and, if necessary, by harboring to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up on the world market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the public of the event organised by the Energy Consumers Association. It is a non-profit group that is profiled as a "energy-consumer audio tower" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that it is one and the same thing.
"Iran and Russia's economic alternative is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with one another," he says, and describes Russia as a "one trick circus number", which is based on fossil fuels.
The opinions will be timed for a situation where Trump’s administration has sought to enhance the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and to replace significantly the cheaper Russian liquidated natural gas.
In order to enhance this, Trump’s administration, including President Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, binds Berlin to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project to double the capacity of 110 billion cubic meters of the pipe in use is a purely economic project.
Kreml claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington's opposition, and considers it an example of unhealthy competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier,” says Russian Minister of Energy, Mr Novak, after meeting the US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has caused a response in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industrial roof organization, the German Industry Central Union, has called on the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel very problematic about the involvement of the third state in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Director of the German Industry Central Union, recently after meeting the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, intends to carefully consider the candidate for presidential elections in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that he “was carefully considering the presidential candidate after the interim elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidate in the open survey in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to move to Washington and correct our faulty administration, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom,” he said.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider becoming presidential candidate."
Warren evaluates President Donald Trump during the opportunity to say, "It's going to take the country in the wrong direction."
“I am concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy,” he says.
Warren has appeared as a direct criticism of Trump and the candidate of this Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote, "I guess we need FBI investigation before we vote."
However, according to the opinion survey published on Thursday, the majority of the voters of Warren do not support this condition in 2020.
According to the study conducted by the University of Suffolk Political Research Institute and Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts do not support the position of the Senator.
32% support candidateship.
More of the respondents to the survey supported Deval Patrick’s position on the condition of 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
In other discussions, nominal candidates for democratic elections in 2020 are, for example, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden said he would formally decide on his candidate by January.
Sarah Palin refers to his son's war trails at Donald Trump's Election Event
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and he was charged with family violence.
"What my son will have to go through after I return home, I can well identify with other families that will face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our soldiers return to the home," he told the audience meeting at the election conference in Oklahoma Donald Trump.
Palin called the arrest "flow horse in the living room" and said his son, like the other war veterans, "return home a little slightly, they return to hardened, they return to wondering whether he and his companions in the army and air forces have done this for the benefit of the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Dan Bennett, the police informant of Wasilla, he was charged with the abuse of family violence and women, and the abuse of family violence and the treatment of the gun.
18 states and the Colombian Federation support the action against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian Federation are seeking a change to the new policy in force in the United States, according to which asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or family violence.
18 representatives of the state and the federal community have left a letter of justice for friends in Washington on Friday. The letter supports asylum seekers who violate the line says NBC News.
The entire name of the lawyer has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union raised against the federal rule in August.
He says his partner, "and his sons of his violent gang," assaulted him.
He was arrested in Texas.
The general prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which most of the U.S. asylum seekers are home to countries where gang and family violence have spread to all levels of society.
The new asylum policy of the United States repealed the decision taken by the Board of Appeal for Asylum in 2014 that unpaid migrants could apply for asylum on the basis of family violence.
In his opinion, the General Prosecutor Karl Racine of the Colombian Federation commented on Friday that the new line " ignores the state, federal and international law for decades".
"The law of the Federal State requires all asylum applications to be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle infringes this principle," the letter says the friends of the right.
The prosecutors also argue in a letter that the access of asylum seekers is preventing practical damage to the US economy, as the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and “import the necessary additional workforce”.
In June, the General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges on immigration matters to suspend the granting of asylum from victims of family violence and gang violence.
"Security is intended for persons fleeing from their country due to persecution or fear caused by belonging to the race, religion, nationality or a particular class of society," Sessions announced in its opinion of 11.6.
The asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even serious problems – that people face every day in the world.
The unwanted survivors’ rescues continue in Pala – the number of victims found has already doubled.
The situation for the survivors becomes more serious.
"Your business is very tense," said Mother Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old, when she calms her hot baby, please at the evacuation centre in the ruined city.
Ambulances bring new bodies from a minute.
There's little clean water."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes, pick up watered goods and try to save what can be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and 7.5 hospitals injured in the radiation of the magnitude are full.
Some of the injured people, such as Dwi Haris, who suffer from fractures of the spinal cord and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital, where patients are being treated for persistent, powerful retardations.
His eyes are filled with tears when he repeated how rage earthquake shaken the fifth floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I missed the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris tells Associated Press, and tells me he was in his family as a wedding guest in the city.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The American Ambassador blames China for "provocation" with "propaganda statements"
The U.S. Ambassador blames Beijing for using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool. This is a week after the Chinese newspaper had published a four-page ad in the US newspaper, which praises the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
The United States President Donald Trump referred to the annex to the China Daily magazine last Wednesday in the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China for interference with the Congressials held on 6.11.
Trump’s accusations of Beijing’s attempts to intervene in the US elections mean a new step in Washington’s expanding campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal that a foreign government spreads notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in the escalating trade war, where both parties inter alia impose customs duties on counterparty export products.
According to Chinese and American experts, China’s revenge tariffs were targeted in the beginning of the trade war, such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador of China and the long-term governor of Iowa states that Beijing has committed damage to the American working population, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a large exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating provocations further by publishing propaganda statements in our own free press," Branstad wrote in his opinion paper published in the Sunday Des Moines Register.
"The Chinese government will benefit from the free word and press traditions of the United States by placing the paid notification on the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In contrast, the different opinions of the Peking Streets appear only limited, and the real, divergent opinions that Chinese citizens may not see in the alarming development of their economy. This is because the media is strictly in the retreat of the Communist Party of China," he writes.
Branstad continues to say that “one of the largest newspapers in China refused to publish the offer” by the article he wrote, but not precisely what magazine it is about.
Kavanaugh Fiasko expelled female speakers from Republicans, analytics warn
The fact that many of the tops of the Republicans are standing behind and defending Brett Kavanaugh the Supreme Court can cause a response, according to analytics, especially in future interim elections with female voters.
The emotions around the case have been on major rounds, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to proceed in the vote.
"These things can't be canceled," says State Professor Grant Reeher Syracuse at the Maxwell Institute of The Hill, published on Saturday.
Reeher does not believe that senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona)'s last minute offer to investigate the FBI will be disappointed by angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday and will not be forgotten tomorrow or November,” says Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior adviser and the reporter of the National Reform Group MoveOn on Friday, according to the newspaper in the capital.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "coming to November" when demonstrating their minds in the Senate corridor of the ruled Republicans of Justice when deciding to proceed to Kavanaugh's appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic reports.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluated," says Stu Rothenberg, an unanimous political analyst in interviewing the news site.
People say that inspiration has already been high, and that is true.
But it could be even greater, especially with women's unsure voters and younger voters aged 18-29, who often do not vote because they don't like the president."
Analyticians anticipate a possible response if the Republicans progress with confirmation before the Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court's candidate, in which he claimed sexual harassment.
“This is going to be a confusion for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former President of the National Committee of the Republicans on the NBC News at the beginning of the week.
“This is not just about the vote or the final vote of the Committee, or whether Kavanaugh is being questioned; it is about how the Republicans have acted on the matter and how they have treated Fordia,” Guy Cecil, head of the United States of America’s Priorities Group for Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided in whether they should believe in the statement of witnesses of Ford or Kavanaugh when a few majority tend to tend to the latter.
According to the new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents will be sure or likely to believe in Ford’s witness statement, while 35% say they are definitely or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say that Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied in his statement of witnesses, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake moves forward, the FBI investigates Ford and at least one of the other charges filed by Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
In front of the judiciary, Ford proved that Kavanaugh was enraged in drinking in Ford when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court has revealed to him at the student festival in the 1980s when they study at Yale University.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet attack against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source code of Berners-Lee on the Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their information is stored and who has access to any information.
In an interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes about Inrupt's goal is to "govern the world".
“It has to be done now,” he said, referring to his startup.
"It's a historical moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data stock", i.e. POD.
It may include lists of contact information, memory lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available at the same time.
In the personal data stock, it is unique that you are fully tied to the user who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "for personal entry into force through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to give resources, processes, and required skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some hired developers working with the project and a community consisting of volunteers.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on Inrupt’s website. This is all available from this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team do not discuss with "Facebook and Google whether people should offer a complete change where all their business models will be translated to their heads in one night."
“We don’t ask their consent to the matter.”
In an article published in the Medium Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote in Inrupt, “the task is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new network built by Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee arranged the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been influential in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee maintains its position as the founder and manager of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute after launching Inrupt.
"I am an extremely optimistic network for the next period, watching" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the city remembers the hero priest of the First World War
The city celebrates the only Victoria Cross-midal awarded, soldiered priest of the Church of England after the events have passed for 100 years.
The bravery medal was awarded to Colonel Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 due to the attacks of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt villages.
However, four days later, the Vann was created without ever being aware of the highest honour of the British army.
Two of his grandchildren were revealing a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "interesting symbolic"; the memorial was revealed just 100 years after his rewarded grandfather's urine.
According to London Gazette, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quent “in a very dense fog and under heavy field guns and machine rifles.”
Later, he fell on his front line and "the greatest braveness" led to the progress of the troops before his stretching alone to the field girls. In the following battle, Vann folded on his own hand three gun patter soldiers.
Colonel Vann died of a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "something I never achieved, something that arouses respect."
Michael Vann He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were throwing a chapel after the parade of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band orchestra.
Michael Vann says it’s “a great honor to be part of the parade” and added: “A great humanity is remembering the glory of the true hero.”
Friends of the Free Battle were waiting for the Bellator 206 tournament all night – the TV channel showed Pipsa Possua
Imagine the situation in which you've been watching the expected Bellator 206 tournament all night, and not the whole event.
The San Jose event program had 13 matches, of which six main series matches, and the show was intended to be a direct broadcast in the UK channel Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a round program, Pipsa Possuun viewers turned into a huge shock.
Some viewers were not really happy to watch over the whole night due to the match.
One of the friends in the free fight opened up on Twitter, describing the replacement of the match with children’s drawings as a “some sick joke”.
"This content was not appropriate to be presented at 6:00 in the morning, so they had to change it to the children's program," Dave Schwartz, the senior CEO of Bellator's marketing and communication program exchanged."
"Pig Possu, yes."
Bellator’s CEO Scott Coker said that schedules will be being worked to enable British viewers to follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking about the reproduction, which we'll probably get the program to work," Coker said.
"But it's 6:00 in the morning, and we won't get the program presented before Sunday, which is on Monday at their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed their heads, the messages began to go in the direction and to the other, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case, but it was a legislative matter.
I can promise this will not happen next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and tried too much.
This is a sad situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley felt unworthy because of his sexuality
Swimming jumpers and Olympic athletes Tom Daley tells us that he felt lower than anyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete says he only noticed when he came to high school that "all are not the same as me."
Lauren Laverne, who spoke in the Desert Island Discs, said he spoke about gay rights in order to give others “will”.
He also tells us how after having a child, the winning of the Olympics was no longer so important.
The long-term radio program's permanent director, Kristy Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
In Laverne’s first program, Daley told me that he felt “small” than everyone else, because “he was not socially acceptable to like boys and jobs.”
He says, "To this day, these emotions, to feel less and different have been reality, and they have given me strength and energy that I have needed to succeed."
He said he wanted to show himself “something” so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when his sexuality eventually appeared.
The two-fold Olympiamitalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he is present in this year's National Community competitions to encourage homosexuality to be criminalized in other countries.
He said he came out because he feels lucky to live openly without sanctions and wanted to give “will” to other people.
The Triple World Champion tells his love for a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – is a “surprising surprise.”
Daley married this Oscar winner 20 years older last year, but says that the age difference has never been a problem.
“If you experience so many things as you are young,” he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find another age that would have experienced similar contradictions and contradictions,” Daley says.
The couple received a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of the change of Daley’s “size perspective”.
“If you had asked me last year, my life would have rotated around winning the gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than a golden Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic Cultatalin."
His son was named according to Daley's father, who died in 2011 at only 40 years of age to brain cancer.
Daley said his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the most recent things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic tickets. He wanted to sit in the front.
“I couldn’t tell him he would no longer be there to be in front,” Daley said.
“I kept her hand when her breath stopped. Only after she had really stopped breathing and she was dead, I finally realized that she was not vulnerable,” she said.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I knew this was something I dreamed of all my life — jumping in front of the public at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” Daley says.
This was also an enthusiasm in his first song selection – Heather Small's song "Proud" – that raised emotions when she was preparing for the Olympics, and who still gets her skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson Mickelson's exchange seat on Saturday Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing the 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to be disappointed considerably to avoid the replay from his history as an unhappy presentation.
Mickelson, who plays a record of 12 times every two years, moved to the exchange seat by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourball and foursome game on Saturday.
Generally, the five-fold major tournament winner at the center of the attention was now spending half a day as a cheerleader and on the other side of the field trying to take over their beats.
Mickelson, a 48-year-old, who was not even held at the top of his career, is not the ideal choice for a strict Le Golf National field where a long-growing bear punishes inaccurate beats.
If the field itself does not have enough opposition to Mickelson, in the 9th game of Sunday, there is a well-known British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who plays together with the new Tommy Fleetwood, which aims to reach all four wins this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the 12 double game, get a flying flight, Michelson’s game can prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but anything else could be said in the situation.
“He fully understands the role he played today. He knocked me on his back, rutically, and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is definitely one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he would play two matches.
I imagined something else, but this is how we ended up in such a solution.
He wants to be in that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldon's record of several Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can also indicate the end of the Ryder Cup career, which was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half, but Furyk said his presence to the team brings something undefined.
"He's funny, sarcasm, smart, keeps people at the expense of a joke, and he's a funny guy with whom everyone likes," he explains.
“Younger players probably had fun with him this week, and it must be fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his bet in the game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows how long leadership can be lost quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows about the experience that Ryder Cup’s immeasurable leadership before the last day’s double games can become a rude journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros led five points of leadership towards the Americans, but who survived as a winner with the lime tips just and just the size of his nose and won with the narrowest margin141⁄2–131⁄2.
“It reminds us of how we led in Valderrama, we led sharply in Brookline, where we lost, but we won Valderrama, although scarcely,” said Bjorn, after watching the team 5-3 wins in 2018 both on Friday and yesterday on the 10-6rd team at the Le Golf National field.
History will show both me and all other team members that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game isn't over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and we aim only for it.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who play on our side, but we are aware of what is opposite: the best players in the world."
I am pleased about how his team players have come out of a difficult field, Bjorn adds: “I will never lick until I drop in such a thing.
Tomorrow is completely different.
Tomorrow there are individual performances, and then we talk about different things.
It is great to be on the field with the partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player’s capacity will be tested on the grounds.
This is a message that needs to be sent to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to achieve the best performance.
Now we have to give up a partner who can go to the field alone and do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, the counterparty's captain Jim Furyk will demand a better performance of his players as individuals than they could as partners. Exceptions from this are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the full translations of the last day in both directions. He was involved in a winning team in Brookline before he ended up a loser when the European team won "Medinah with a miracle".
"I remember every word of evil," he answered the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw of the team of 1999 handed the lines of his team to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medinah.
When it moves in one direction, it poses a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have set up our composition according to it and put the boys on the field in the way we want to, as you know, we are going to do miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead a defense fight and he meets Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are in the next position to meet their European counterparts.
"I put the group's friends in this order because I think it's carrying the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on his choices of double games.
Germany’s new warship will be delayed again
The latest fregat of the German fleet should have been introduced in 2014, the ship’s aim is to replace the outdated cold war equipment, but it will be introduced in the past next year due to faulty systems and explosive costs, according to local media.
According to the reporter Die Zeit, “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the first ferret class of Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the fleet in 2014, but the problem of worrying post-transport has been persecuted by an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the ship in 2007 are intended to replace the old Bremen class fregates.
According to the information available, they are equipped with effective tyres, missile systems for the fight against aircraft and surface vessels, and with deformation technology, such as radar reflectivity, and technology to reduce the detection of infrared and acoustic signals.
The main features of the ship also include its longer service range – new fregats should be able to operate on the sea for up to two years without visiting the harbor.
However, continuous delays mean that warships representing the top of technology – which are said to improve the influence of Germany in the overseas regions – are already obsolete at the time of their entry into service, Die Zeit notes.
The bad luck F125 fregat ended in the titles last year when the German navy officially refused to launch the ship and restored it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet will return the ship after it is shipped.
For the reasons of return, little is known, but the German media has spoken about the essential "software and equipment errors" that make the warship unworthy to battle tasks.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the size of the Baden-Württemberg crew is around 120, which is only half of the senior Bremen class fregats crew.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is considerably overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet’s potential to subsequent updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice heavyer than the equivalent class ships used by Germany in the Second World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the entire project price is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to rise to EUR 3.1 billion when the original price was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the use of new fregats have emerged when the German marine power has recently been warned to shrink.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Director of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's available ships are “falling out”.
According to the authorities, the problem has increased over time because old ships have been removed, but no new ships have been submitted.
He complained that no Baden-Württemberg-class fregats could be introduced.
The Environmental Organization Listens to the Secret Life of Flags
A new study in the area in the upper countries of Scotland aims to find out how bats utilize the landscape when hunting food.
The new study is hoped to bring new light to the behavior of these unique flying mammals and guide future protection measures.
The National Trust for Scotland research conducted by scientists monitors the troubles and dwarf packs, as well as the earrings and water wings in the inverewe Garden area of the vegetarian garden located in Wester Ross.
The study sets specific storage equipment into the main points of the region to monitor the operation of the bats during the period.
The organization’s employees and volunteers also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequencies of voting, as well as the kinds of species that are concerned, shall be ensured by the analysis of experts.
On the basis of the results, an environmental map and a report will be drawn up in which the behaviour of the bats can be presented in the area’s dimensional image.
Rob Dewar, the organisation’s Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the rest, and how different species use them.
Knowledge is helpful in the design of habitat areas such as the creation of grasslands and forest areas, so that bats and related species are taken into account.
Scotland and the United Kingdom’s rest populations have decreased significantly over the last hundred years.
Construction and construction work threatens restplaces and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also constitute a risk, such as fly papers and certain chemicals used in construction materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of the hunting methods, their ears are more useful in catching the catch than in the eyes.
Pets use advanced echoing techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is an organization focusing on the protection of the rural environment, which maintains more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares from different sides of the country – and they take the bats seriously.
It has ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of rest places and in some cases also carry out rescue measures for animals.
The organization has even established the first and only sole protection area of the landscape of Threave in the Dumfries and Galloway. Eight of the ten lepaque oils in Scotland are met in the area.
As a farmer, David Thompson says the area is ideal for the rest.
"Threave is very well suited for bats," he says.
“We have old buildings and trees and a good living environment.
Our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us to understand better what bats need to succeed.”
He stresses how important it is to check the buildings in case of restocks before taking rehabilitation, because the destruction of one resting place of rest can involuntally cause up to 400 female leagues and son death and destroy the entire local population.
Pets are protected animals and their killing, disruption or destruction of their rest places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official of the Defence Organization of the Leagues, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, “We still have a lot to learn about our babes, and we still don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo denies rape accusations while lawyers prepare a case against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has stamped rape accusations against him as "valeuutious" and says people want to "remember themselves" by using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action in order to challenge the German Der Spiegel magazine.
The assault of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping a American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in the Lasvegas hotel in 2009.
He said he paid the victim $375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared in the Instagram broadcast to 142 million followers only hours after the statements were made. The 33-year-old footballer dramatically opposed the accusations and described them as "valeuutious".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, false news," the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
“They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it belongs to this profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player continued to smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers prepare to challenge Der Spiegel for claims that they have called the Reuters News Office “unacceptable reporting of the doubts under the privacy protection”.
According to Lawyer Christian Schertz, the player demands reimbursement of “spiritual sufferings in accordance with the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged case was reported in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldon and Mayorgan were reported to have met at the nightclub and moved to the player's room where he is alleged to have been assaulted, according to the papers submitted to the District Court of Nevada Clark County.
Mayorga claims Ronaldon landed on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was 99% good, but whose "one percent" disappointed.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed a couple of sex, but it was a mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photos of his injuries in the hospital, but later ended up in a mediation solution because he was “a terrified of the possibility of revenge” and was concerned about “being subject to public humiliation”.
34-year-olds are now applying for a revocation of the reconciliation procedure because they are still traumatic about the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault from Manchester United and moved to the Italian mighty team Juvent with a $100 million agreement.
Brexit: The UK would “repent forever” of the end of the car production
The UK would “return forever” if it would lose its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, he said.
He added that he considered it "carrying" the notification of the United Kingdom Department of Toyota to temporarily suspend production in a factory near Derby in Burnaston, if the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese automotive manufacturer says the impact of border delays will be seen as loss of jobs if the brexine ends without agreement.
A factory in Burnaston, which manufactured Toyotan Auris and Avensis, manufactured nearly 150 000 cars last year. 90% of them were taken to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory will be interrupted," Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Toyotan Burnaston unit said.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed the fears of withdrawing from the European Union in terms of how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced to close its factory to Mini for a month when brexit is completed.
The main concern is to address the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of an uncontracted brexit.
The Toyota production line is operated by a timely JOT principle where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from Britain and the EU region, and cars are manufactured from the order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it may cause disturbances at the border, which sector may lead to delays and disruptions from parts.
Maintaining more than a 24-hour storage at Derbyshire Factory is impossible, according to Toyota, and production would be interrupted.
Clark says Theresa May’s EU relations plan is “accidentally calibrated to avoid these checks at the border”.
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that does not only mean success in the current situation, but the opportunity that we need to take advantage of," he said in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"Not just Toyota, but also other manufacturers' statements show that we must be able to continue the series of very well-functioned supply chains so far."
Toyota is unable to tell us how long production would be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and operates as a CEO at the factory, says concern among the growing members: "The jobs lost in my experience will never come back.
The reporter of the government says: “We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump’s challenging meeting with Deputy Minister Rod Rosenstein can be "to be moved another week" around the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh due to a debtful duty, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, which, in turn, investigates Russian interference with elections, Trump’s assistants’ relations with Russia and the possible activities of the President to prevent justice.
There have been rumors in Washington for months about Trump’s intention to separate the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardise the neutrality of Mueller’s investigation.
Earlier this month, New York Times reports Rosenstein’s discussions on the possibility of recording secret discussions with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President on the basis of Amendment 25 of the United States Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was to resign Rosenstein from his office.
However, President Trump was at that time visiting the United Nations in New York, so the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would not “specially” separate Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because the time of the Senate Justice Committee was held together, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI a week of lasting investigation against Kavanaugh, which continued to postpone the vote of the Senate Assembly.
Trump's head of press Sarah Sanders was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, Sanders said, “The number of days for this is not set. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed even a week because of everything else that is happening in the Supreme Court.
I always want to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists might disagree with this argument: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Newsanker Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the reason for the scarcity of press conferences is due to other reasons than to disgust the "humidity" of TV journalists, but said, "I do not deny the fact that they are looking for attention."
However, Sanders told me to understand that the direct contacts between Trump and the press are going to increase.
"The President holds more questions than any president before him," he says, and adds more evidence without saying, "We've checked those numbers."
"The press conferences will continue to be organised," Sanders said, but "it's absolutely much better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We are often trying to do this, and you have seen that we have done so many times in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly responds to questions when leaving the White House or participating in open events or press conferences with valuers visiting.
The presence alone at the press conference is rare.
This week, the President in New York, may have shown the reason for this when it appears to be unstoppable and sometimes strange to journalists.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to workers from EU countries from the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) in relation to the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the workers of the Scottish Health System from EU countries to express their gratitude and wish to stay in the country after Brexit.
Mr Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member of Parliament, sent a letter when the United Kingdom’s resignation of the EU is less than six months.
The Scottish government has already prepared to cover the costs of applications for "installed status" of EU citizens working with specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer the negotiation between the United Kingdom and the EU has continued towards the expected decisions in autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also enhanced the preparations for a non-contractual difference.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat now how much we appreciate the contribution of each of our employees to citizenship without looking at it.
colleagues from and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Emergency Surgery Due to Main Injuries
Tennessee State Tigers team supporter Christion Abercrombie has been in an emergency surgery since the team was destroyed from 31 to 27 Vanderbilt Commodors on Saturday, reports Tennessea reporter Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's chief coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred just before the halftime.
“He came to the sideline and simply shrinked into it,” Reed said.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the side limit before they put him on the couples and took him to the side for a more accurate assessment.
Tennessee State's CEO told WSMV channel supplier Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was released from the surgery in Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "There is no information on the type/speed of injuries at this stage" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second year student at Tennessee State University and plays the first time in the team after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five bucks on Saturday before he left the game, making a total of 18 bucks this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher batch tax when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people according to new plans of the Conservative Party.
The aim of this amendment is to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase of the batch tax applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to 120 million pounds per year – to help homeless people
Theresa May will inform foreign buyers today of the higher charge rates to be charged when buying property in the UK. The extra money is used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper apartments and has paid attention to taxing good-benefit people.
The increase in the batch tax is directed to people and businesses who do not pay taxes to the UK. The extra money that comes from this will be directed to the government to facilitate the disabilities of the homeless.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp tax two years ago, may be up to three per cent in addition to the increases in the second housing and investment housing.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to £120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s renovations are purchased by residents who are permanently resident in the United Kingdom, which will increase prices and make it difficult for primary housing buyers to be able to acquire their property on the market.
Many wealthy regions in Britain, especially in its capital, have become ‘await cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line will only come weeks after Boris Johnson presented a reduction in the batch tax as a means of facilitating the purchase of young people’s first homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the prices of real estate high by buying the country and leaving it unbuilt, and urged Prime Minister May to reject the quotas of affordable apartments in order to correct the "sacrifice of living".
Corby has published a series of proposals to reform the housing market, including the restrictions on rentals and the termination of "inconscious decisions".
He would also like to give more power to the delegations in matters related to the construction of new apartments.
Prime Minister May says: “I said last year I was going to own my Prime Minister’s dream — that every generation of life should be better than the return of his predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, can buy apartments as easily as hard as those living in the UK.
Too many people have become too far-reaching dreams, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality.”
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to lead the Scottish National Team"
Jack Ross, director of Sunderland, says his "primary goal" is to be the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotland has been inspired to raise the country's northern corner back to its feet. The team is currently in the third place in the United Kingdom's second division.
Ross moved to the "Stadium of Lights" this summer after he had directed St Mirren back to the Scottish elections in the last season.
As a player, I wanted to play in my country team.
I got to the second team and that was it," Ross says at the BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
“I often looked at my father and my Scottish games at Hampden, and that’s something that has always pulled me back.
This opportunity will only come up if I succeed as a manager of the club.”
The leaders of Ross are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about entering the boots of his nominal predecessors with his name. He has previously rejected Barnsley and Iptswich Town's offers.
“That’s the moment I’m going to see my success, whether I can return this company to the selection.
Based on the structure and ability of the Society, it is undoubtedly part of the electoral industry,” he says.
“It’s not easy to access, but I probably think I’m successful only if I can trust the team back to the election.”
Ross has only been a manager for three years: first as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats Coach Group.
After that, he helped Alloa rise from the third series of dropping games and lifted St Mirren from the fall of champions during the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his career in the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably in a real road cross with my career," he remembers the time when he moved to Alloa's leadership.
“I believed I was better suited as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, earned moderately well, and got to enjoy some relatively big successes.
Playing can be hard.
The player has to deal with a lot of things every week.
I’m still going through the same things, such as stress and pressure caused by work, but running the team feels the right task.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I do it to work, and I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life.”
The whole interview is listening to the Sportsound broadcast on Sunday 30.9, at Radio Scotland's frequency at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy a torch is on Saturday at 17.30, research shows
The summer heat wave has fired the UK’s hardcore pubs, but at the same time increased pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pubs and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The figures of Peter Martin’s CGA business consultant says: “Continuous solar weather and the expected longer participation of England in the World Championships meant that in July the sale of pubs was 2.8% higher, while the month was worse for restaurants.
The June 1.8% reduction in the sale of restaurants only worsened in July.
The bubbles and bars focused on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the drop in the sales of restaurants.
The bubbles focused on the diet are also suffering from hell, but less dramaticly than the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get out of their minds.
The sales of roasted pubs and bars increased by 6.6% in the month, and the sales of foods decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a RSM company providing services for recreational and hotel restaurants, says: “The results continue the trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sport events are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of non-home food market.
It is no surprise that the struggle for restaurant chains continues, although the decrease in sales of 4.8% per year is shrinking, especially now that the sector is currently struggling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have become a worse seam for food-focused operators, and only time will show if the cinematographic warmer temperatures in the sector are incredibly needed.
The total increase in the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slowdown in the creation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer next to the sale of the UK pub, bar and restaurant, which collects and analyzes results data in 47 fields of competence from a group of competitors with total turnover of over £9 billion. It is considered to be a reliable measure in the sector.
A fifth of the children secret social media accounts from their parents
A fifth of the children – some of them 11 years old – secrets social media accounts from their parents and teachers, research reports
20,000 students in higher education revealed the existence of an increasing phenomenon of "Instagram Feik Tiles"
The news raised concern that accounts can share sexual content
20% of students said they were holding a head account that was shown to parents
A fifth of the children – some of them up to 11 years old – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
The study of 20,000 upper school students quickly revealed the existence of ‘Instagram feik accounts’, which refers to the Instagram website for the sharing of images.
The news has raised fears that accounts can publish sexually susceptible content.
20 percent of students said they kept cleaning the ‘head account’ for parents while using other private accounts.
One mother found messages written by a teenager in which he hoped that he would be raped, after colliding with his 13-year-old daughter on a secret site.
The study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Advisory Board (HMC) found that 40 per cent of the 11-18-year-olds had two separate profiles, and half of the respondents agreed to hold secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, says, “It’s alarming that so many teenagers feel the attraction of setting up an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle's "Athletes' voice" to the Scottish Athletes Government
Eilidh Doyle has been elected a member of the government of Scotland athletes. He participates in the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most prized general athlete in Scotland. President Ian Beattie describes the title as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the extensive, international experience gathered by the athlete during the last decade.
“Eilidh is highly respected with athletes in Scotland, United Kingdom and internationally. I am sure that Scotland athletes would benefit greatly from his appointment to government,” Beattie said.
Doyle says, “I am eager to wait for my role as an athletes’ voice storm, and I hope that I can be useful and help guide Scotland sport in the right direction.”
Four Olympic cultures won the American athlete, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Atlantic, and now acting as a permanent commentator of the BBC, lost his walking ability due to a transient brain blood circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time to show up, fit and fit.
This has been a exhausting job, but I've recovered completely, learned to walk again and now I'm already working on the agitation!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Moms Similar to cows ads share opinions online
Breast pumps produced by mothers who are breast-feeding with milk cows have shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, who manufactures consumer technology, has brought on the market a product called "the first silent and wearable breast pump of the world". Its marketing is accelerated by the language of cheeks and the style of music videos, which describes the release of the new pump to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in the hein-fulled bearings, among other things, in the words of the following song: “Yes, I’m going to lyp myself, but I don’t see him,” and “if you don’t see them, they’re not tears, they’re not tears, they’re tits.”
The teller continues: "Shut it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'll milk my leagues."
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company caused a discussion online.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments gathered have caused contradictory reactions in viewers. Many say it makes a mess of the dairy industry’s daily ‘horror’.
“The use of the pets in advertising of this product was a very bad decision.
They have to become pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them soon after childbirth,” a commentary writes.

Another viewer commented: “It is understandably traumatic to both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their baby?”
The third commenter added: "A full real-life ad."
I also received a advertisement: a woman admitted that the ad was "sucky".
“I think this is a great idea.
I'd get something like that if I were still breast-feeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product," reads one of the comments.
The second viewer commented: “This is a fun ad that is aimed at mothers pumping (most often at work or in toilets) and ‘creating themselves as cows’.
The aim of the advertising is not to praise or condemn the milk industry.”
At the end of the ad video, women reveal that they have danced unmarkable pumps in their breasts.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
Instead, the Elvie pump is completely silent, it has no leads and hoses, and it is incredibly suitable for breastfeeding, which gives women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even walk outside during pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and artistic director of the Mother Advertising Office, commented: "Elvie pump is a transforming product that deserves a bold and provocative income on the market.
By breast-feeding mothers and milk cows we wanted to bring all the challenges related to the use of the breast pump into the light bowl, we brought out the feeling of the incredible freedom of the new pump in a entertaining and identifiable way."
The Elvie pump has ended up in titles before.

Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in all silence
The number of retarded migrant children has increased dramatically, despite the fact that the monthly number of cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged. This is due to the fact that, as a result of severe retoric and policies introduced by Trump’s administration, children have become difficult to invest in their families.
Most subsidiaries are traditionally composed of paperless migrants, and registration as a subsidiaries can jeopardize their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential subsidiaries and other adults of the economy must give their fingerprints, and that this information will be shared with the entry authorities.
Matthew Albence, the High Level Immigration and Customs Authority, last week, proved to be arrested by the Office for tens of people who had applied for subsidiaries for minor immigrants.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested persons had no previous criminal record.
"The 80% of people who are either members of their family or members of their households are illegal in the country, and most of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to search for these people," Albence says.
When attempting to deal with children’s cases faster, the authorities have introduced new rules that, in some cases, the case must be dealt with within a month of the time limit of 60 days prior to the arrest, the staff of the reception centre shall report.
Many would rather be held through a video conference than personally in the case of a court dealing with immigrants.
Those who are not considered legitimate for assistance shall be expelled promptly.
According to the reports published in the last few months by the reception centre workers and the system, the time spent in the child’s captivity affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent explosions or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, the concern is particularly highlighted in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of child’s despair can be ignored due to the large size of the facility.
They add that the transfer of children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children suffer from traumas at the moment.
Syria orders the US, France and Turkey to leave immediately
During the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been in war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as the prime minister, said that the foreign troops would be illegally in the country using an excuse for the fight against terrorism, and that "they will come to work with them in accordance with it".
“They have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed “the war against terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and afterwards, and where millions of people have been forced to escape their homes.
He said Damascus continues to “sold battle until the whole Syria has been cleaned” from both terrorist organizations and “incompetent foreign troops”.
The United States has around 2,000 soldiers located in Syria, where they are mostly training and guided by Kurds and President Bashar al-Assad against Arab troops.
France has invested battles to tear up over 1,000 military departments.
On the refugee question, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for return and accused of “some Western” spreading “irrational fears” that encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
“We have invited international community and aid organisations to facilitate these refunds,” he said.
"They politized something that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid before the end of the war has been agreed by a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to the UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer area in the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to drive political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on the territory of the Syrian forces supported by Russia, with three million people.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has "selected time limits" and expressed the wish that military action would be targeted by jihadists, including al-Qaida-related al-Nusra front fighters, "which will be destroyed".
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to summon the first meetings of the new government and opposition members of the Committee for the creation of the draft constitution of the post-war Syrian Syrian constitution and the imbalance of the road for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the present Constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Trump becomes elected for another period
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the elections of 2020 unless, as many viewers of the liberals are likely to wish, the office and the scandal will end his premature term.
This would undoubtedly be "the decision of the most dramatic presidential term ever!"
No signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers so far.
After 2014, the figures of the best viewer have doubled to 1.05 million CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best time compared to 1.7 million people in the four years ago, and the MSNBC Rachel Maddow Show has reached the cable TV: the top readings of 3.5 million viewers in the main newsletter.
"This is a rock that attracts people because it is something we don't understand," says Neal Baer, the main producer of the ABC Designed Survivor programme, from the minister who will become president of the attack destroyed Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced composer and book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, is another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Unlike other TV programs, the news coming from Washington can determine how Roe vs. Wade comes, whether immigrant families can get to each other and how the world economy can.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet goes outside of the duty of a conscious citizen to look at a six-hour panel of experts denying the use of Bob Woodward's source data for Fear, a 15-hour struttish pilot of Paul Manafort (Washington Post said, "highwillness to make a piece of clothes") and the consequences of the undecorated descriptions of Stormy Daniels' President Trump's anatomy.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario again in the same way as before.
“What he does feel like a real TV program, because it is partly about giving the public something every night,” says the leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Panttilainamo series of Brent Montgomery Trump’s show on variable persons and daily changing trails (NFL disputes, Kim Jong-un’s praise).
You can't miss any episode, or you're gonna fall off the wheels.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a wonderful day on the North coast of Kaua, but he couldn’t go out because he watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not withdraw from the programme where Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate Ombudsman and the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we made all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss said.

Outside, money flows to tight intermediate squad
It is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania has encountered a real cash flow, because, as a result of the reorganization of the congressive circles, two candidates already elected are forced to fight for one place.
This recently re-limited Pittsburg electoral district is a battle challenge for Democrats Conor Lamb, who took place from another electoral district in the spring special elections.
Lamb will compete with another elected candidate, Keith Rothfus, the Republicans, who currently represents the old 12th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which is duplicated with the new 17th electoral district.
The regional division was reintroduced after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old electoral division would favour Republicans against the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th electoral district has been launched in the Finance Sections of the main parties in the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became familiar with Pennsylvania after the 18th congressive district of Pennsylvania's special elections.
The place had been in the Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won the region by 20%.
Political commentators have made a great way forward to the Democrats.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but retreated its intentions
The diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the mild response to Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization Group.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials decided to invite American diplomatic directors back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of the "slow lines to which Taiwan is no longer recognized", said Heather Nauert in his statement earlier this month.
However, punishments were considered only for El Salvador, who received an estimated 140 million dollars of aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, as well as development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, involving financial assistance cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American state with a high level of unemployment and mortgage.
In the course of internal meetings, North and Central America authorities postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity. The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent migrants from seeking to the United States.
However, in mid-September, high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting was desired to progress and that effectively decided speculations on the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give a sign to the mid-October meeting of a kind of importance to the administration's meeting, the diplomats said.
These three American ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in all silence without any new miserable messages or punishments from Washington.
The reporter of the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials. There were two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues anonymously.
Their report confirmed the external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke to the protection of anonymity.
History Teaching
The next inevitable step may be Robert Mueller's report on the possible retreat of President Trump, which now has very impressive evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been announced to investigate whether Trump’s campaign worked secretly with Russia when Russia was involved in the US elections.
If the power changes in the Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just when he prepares to go back to his voters, and he may be convicted of his peers.
There are a lot of mistakes here, and I don't mean that President Trump's loss would be inevitable - rather than the loss of those in Europe.
We need to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and these solutions determine how long this struggle will be formed.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to take Hitler’s power if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the following years of bloodshed.
Historia turns around to such turning points where the unprecedented advance marching of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump separates Deputy Minister Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for the investigation of Mueller's case?
Rosenstein has been hydrated since the public was informed that he had proposed to record a secret president’s speech and thought about the possible inability of the president to handle his mission.
Rosenstein said The Times' report was wrong.
“How do we react if the recent FBI investigation in Brett Kavanugh’s operation is not perfect or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible claims of sexual harassment and dishonest witness statement?
And above all, do we vote in interim elections for a congress that holds President Trump responsible?
If we fail in these beginnings, our democracy will go to a long and dark winter.
But I believe our success is due to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovakia, and she was expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that once filled my diplomatician.
He survived, moved as an immigrant to America and sent me 60 years later to light the sabbath synths on that decorating table of the hakarist.

Rangers Graham Dorrans as optimistic for Rapid Vienna
Rangers meets at home on Thursday of Rapid Vienna, knowing that after a medal played earlier in Spain against Villarreal, the victory of the Austrians would give the team a strong position to reach the G block of Europe.
The knee injury prevented the middle field player Graham Dorrans from reaching the field this season before the Villarreal 2-2 game, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a pushboard for better results.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good resistance,” says the 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a point with us.
We might have been able to catch the win at the end of the win, but all of it is probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we got on the other side and we were better.
Thursday is another important evening in the European Union.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a hard game because their results were good in the previous game. However, I believe that with this set we can give everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year, it was very hard to do with my own injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
Collecting is good and the boys enjoy; the exercises are good.
I hope we can now make full pressure, leave the past season behind and succeed.”
Fear of pension savings takes women to sleep
Although research participants had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, only few had spoken about it with their loved ones.
Approximately half of the participants in the survey said they would discuss the costs of long-term treatment with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents told me they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the subject,” says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Company.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell you your wishes in time.
Talk to your professional and family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor in determining costs.
Take economic advice into the debate: advice can also help you to find a way to cover these costs.
Financial options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance applicable to the coverage of these costs, or self-cost insurance if you have reservations.
Download legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative in order to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also the drafting of the Charter for the management of your financial matters.
It allows you to determine the trusted person to take care of financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your invoices will be paid if you cannot take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to the hospital due to a health situation.

Since the communications links are broken, the rescue authorities have not received any information on the north of Donggala County, which is closer to the surface center of the 7.5 magnified radiation.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Key information about Palo and Donggala in Sulawes Island:
The return is the capital city of the central Sulawes Province, located at the west coast of the Sulawes island, with a population of 379 800 in 2017.

The federal prosecutors are considering a rare death penalty for the suspected NYC terrorist attack
The federal prosecutors in New York seek a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipoville, suspected of eight human lives in New York City, which was rarely punished by the federal crime in the state since 1953.
According to the accusation, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in a logical attack on the West Side Highway bike road in Manhattan, where he drove on foot and cyclists.
According to a statement on the application of the death penalty for the southern administration of New York, the death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to demonstrate that Saipov killed eight of their victims and caused "reasonably" serious physical injuries.
According to the case-law, it is possible to impose a death sentence on both charges.
Week after the attack, the federal law charged Saipoville with a 22-year accusation of eight murders to assist the terrorist organization. The federal prosecutors typically use this criminal name in cases of organised crime. In addition, the accusations included the accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "made planning and preparation", the prosecutors said and described the way in which Saipov made his actions "scient, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damages, damages and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferruchin, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," announced the prosecution.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The former time when the right to the southern administration of New York has been sentenced to death has passed for a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but he was eventually sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in the federal case of New York in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to the conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the legal documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show signs of repentance during the days and months following the attack.
He told the researchers that his actions were good, the police told me.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to a 22-point accusation of being innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defence attorneys representing Saipov, said the defence was "naturally disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand death penalty and not recognition and lifetime without the possibility of release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by the parties to these events," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked him not to require a death penalty.
The Conservative MEP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage today promised a demonstration against the Conservatives to "mobify the civilian army".
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel the pressure of Euroskeptists - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentary representatives proposed him to lead negotiations with the EU.
President Peter Bone of Conservatives said to marshals in Birmingham that the UK would “be already outside” if Farage were a brexit secretary.
But May meets the gaps between their deeply divided lines when concluding the challenge underlined by the conservatives on the side of the stay, associated with a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep its Chequers compromise proposal on the surface of Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as in the pressing of the EU.
The supporters urge him to continue to reach a deal with Brussels, despite the retreat, and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at Leave Means Leave's event in Solihull, he wants to "speak the Chequers proposal to go".
He proposed that Farage be included and should be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd already be out there," he said.
Wellingborough's Parliamentary Representative added: "I'm defending Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying, “We have not fought World Wars to end up underground.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the idea that the public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: “The fact that the British had changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely wrong claim.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the marss and said to journalists, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not supported by the members of the Party and activists who really go to the streets and are responsible for our success.
Leave the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The ministers can keep their work when they keep their promise."
Farage said that politicians need to feel pressure if they intend to round up a decision on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we don't accept it."
When he spoke to the inspired crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are going to round the brexit to feel pressure on you.”
"We are going to mobilize the army of this country's citizens, which gave us victory in the brexit vote, and we will not rest until the UK is again an independent, self-governmental and proud state."
In the meantime, the supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before the two-hour chances held in the city center.
A small group of activists shook "Tories Against Brexit" labels, and the group was founded this weekend.
Lord Adonis, the Labour Party, mocked the conservatives of the security problems they had with the party’s application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are those people who say they're getting IT systems back and all the technology for Canada plus plus and unstoppable borders for free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full farce.
There is no good brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering the presidential candidate
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said he was seriously considering the presidential candidate after November elections.
The Boston Globe reported a masschusetz democrat spoke of his future at the city hall in the Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism against President Trump, meets in November the renovation of the Republicans Geoff Diehl, head of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign of Trump.
Warren was thought to be a candidate against Trump in the 2020 elections.
Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters of the city house after the beginning of the Trump season.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to be president.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and it includes a woman in the highest position.
Arrest of LSU in Sims Shooting
Louisianan Baton Rouge's police announced on Saturday that he arrested a person suspected of the shooting of Wayde Sims, a player of the LSU basketball team.
The Baton Rouge Police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. at the ET press conference.
The police had released a video from the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man that appeared there.
Sims, 20, was shot near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got shot at his head and died as a result of it," Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the Sports network of 247 Sports.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted he was in the interrogation, held a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not arrest the resistance and was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-century junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 starts in the last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 plates per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship of team arrangements offered to him victory from Sebastian Vetteli
When Valtteri Bottas passed over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it turned out that Mercedes' team arrangements play an important role in competition.
Bottas got a good departure and left Hamilton almost his own happiness in defending his place in the first two rounds, calling him to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the shade first and left Hamilton to drive a team with a tail, which should have been resolved.
Mercedes went on the torch later and returned after Vetteli, but Hamilton passed a little contact and the Ferrari driver moved back from the interior and renounced his investment after his two third translations.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21th birthday, started from the backpacks and was the seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition in the long run of the exchange of tyres when he was aiming at a quick stop and a fourth place to take Kimi from the Räikö.
He eventually came to the torch at the 44th round, but he couldn’t increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds when he took the fourth place.
This was a difficult day, because Valtteri was wonderfully performing throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman when he left me.
The team has made an exceptional career in achieving double victory," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein’s claim that he did not leak into the public letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he accused the highest candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking at the event in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's Committee on Justice, but said that what was going on in Senate was an indication of the "nasty, dishonest and dishonestness of people".
“It’s one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the past few days, when we see anger, people who are angry, mean, rude, and unfair,” the president said.
“When we see publications and bedd things and then they say, “Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you going to have these records?
Do you remember his answer... did you get the document... ‘Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bleed."
Wait a minute.
"No, we didn't bleed," he added the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the charges for Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked into the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's charges, and I didn't bleed his story," Feinstein said to the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wish."
But his ban was not suitable for the president who commented on the occasion of Saturday: “I will say to you that it was very gentle with body language.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but that was the worst thing I’ve ever seen in the body language.”
The President continued to defend the candidates of the Supreme Court, whom three women have accused of sexual harassment and believed that democrats would use accusations for their own benefit.
“They have decided to get back into power by any means.
You see that evil and shame, they don’t care about who they hurt or who over who they have to walk to gain power and control,” the mediate said.

Micronesia: Air Niugin says one person is missing after a plane crashed into the lagoon
The airline’s representatives of the airline in the Pacific in Micronesia are now telling one person to be lost, although the previous notifications indicated that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from a safely sinking aircraft.
Air Niugin said it has not been able to find one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that he was trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident researchers.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about missing passenger information such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane had fallen into the water when attempting to land on Chuuk airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed at the hospital on Saturday and everyone was stable.
The cause and the exact course of events is still unclear.
Both airlines and the U.S. Navy have reported the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was driving over the runway.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane landed very low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to bend on a sinking machine in a belt depth water for emergency exits.
He said the passenger staff were panicked and screamed, and that he himself had a mild head injury.

According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the destruction of the airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in the devastation.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor was involved in the re-processing in which a man was accused of burning a mississippian woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett proved hours as an expert witness in the field of information analytics.
He explained to the jury how he had used the data stored on the cell phone in collecting one of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers movements of the victim's death night.
Rowlett said he had received several mobile phone location data that showed Tellis was contrary to his previous claims with Chambers on the night he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis' cell phone was at Chambers at the same time as Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police interviewed Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford proved that he was not in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when it died.
Based on the information stored on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers died, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," Hale said.
The final talks of the defence are designed to be started on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to proceed to the jury later on the same day.

Another dark girl?!
New York Children's Career challenges the parish's court because of a racist text message
A New York babysitter challenges the parish’s right of discriminatory separation after having accidentally received a text message from the mother of the child, in which this complains that he is “one dark man.”
The couple denies to be racists and compares the challenge of "crimination."
Two children’s mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed his worries when the new nurse Giselle Maurice came to work on his first day of work in 2016 and she was told that this was dark.
"EIIIII, FREE," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
But then he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who had made the mistake of his story, had dismissed Maurice, announced that their previous departure passports had been received by his afro-American granddaughter had poorly handled his work and had been waiting for the Filippinians this time.
Maurice got paid for one of his days of work, and he was sent home with a taxi.
Maurice now challenges the couple's court to get compensation for dismissal and wants 350 dollars a day for six months, for which he was originally was washed to live and work in the family, but without agreement.
"I want to show them that it cannot be done," he said to the Post magazine on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to racist claims, saying that the termination of Maurice's employment relationship was a reasonable solution because they could not trust him after he was insulted.
"My wife sent him something that she was not supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told me at the Post interview.
“But would you leave your child to a person you’ve been unfriendly, even if you were accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Really?
Plasco, along with the challenge of excitement, said that his wife had received a baby two months earlier and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Do we start hunting another in such a situation?
It's not very comfortable," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still underway, the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple in social media by denying their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers feared that the public would not identify the speaking bear.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born a little bit after the book’s acceptance, says: “It’s hard to live in a person who read the book for the first time before the publication.
It is fun now that the great popularity of Paddington is known.”
In fact, his father, who had worked as a cameraman of the BBC before his dedication to writing children's books about the adventures of a toy bear, would have optimisticly reacted to the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60-year-old year of the publication of the books seemed bitter because his father died in the last year.
Paddington said he was “described as a very important family member” and said his father was still proud of his success.
“He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn’t at all a decent guy,” the daughter says.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child’s achievement to him; something you’re proud of, even though it’s not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced Paddington's success in that way.
Even though it was his creation, he always gave honor to Paddington.”
I had to say goodbye to my dead daughter on the phone.
His daughter was praised after the plane landed at the Nizzan Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors tried to save her life.
“Nad played a little bit of a difference and said the situation was really bad that he was not expected to survive,” says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then they called and said my daughter will die in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The medications to help doctors keep his heart running gradually disappeared from his body.
He was dead a little earlier, and now everything turned out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was over.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation around me with families and other people.
I had to keep myself together."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who was dying for his daughter's loss, got into an airplane among other passengers who didn't know anything about the trials he was currently undergoing.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I kept my head down and tears were all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a huge sympathy for Nadi.
He needed my love and understanding now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Depressing women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and telephone number that can be supported.
Davis's son Tyler was depressed at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want anyone’s parents to have to experience the emotions I know every day,” he said.
Davis, 45 in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with an infectious refreshment.
“He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile lights the whole room.”
But he quit his job before he died because he felt “in the darkness.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother who had removed his life.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of the consequences.
Davis created cards to tell people that there are people who can go talk to even if it was a friend.
Don't stay quiet - you have to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years, and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years of co-operation soon after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was down or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"We noticed a change in his behavior before Christmas.
He was in the country on Christmas day. When the children opened their gifts, he didn’t take a watch contact or anything like it.”
He says Mark's death was a serious trauma for them, but they need to find out: "It breaks down the family.
It's gonna tear us apart.
But we just have to continue our lives and fight forward.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts his investigation.
“I thought that if we really could do what he wanted – in time and extent – we might be able to achieve a bit of unity,” Flake said on Saturday, and added to the fear that the committee “will degrade” to the ends caused by the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican support seek FBI investigation?
The contradictory is about timing.
The interim elections are only five weeks away, 6 November, and if the success of the Republicans is weak as expected, their efforts to make the man they want to be elected to the highest right of the country become difficult.
George W. Bush has grabbed the phone and called the Senators to lobby them to give their support to Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met through her wife Ashley, who was president Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is prepared?
In the Senate, which currently sits 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, a vote will be held.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, so Vice-President Mike Pence could blow up the game and confirm his choice to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea trails falls during Kim
According to the South Korean Legislator, the number of people who were deployed from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted South Korea’s Convergence Ministry and told me that the incisions took place last year in 1 127 in 2011, 2,706.
According to Park, border checks have been tightened between North Korea and China, as well as increases in the prices of human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not been publicly commented on.
The majority of North Korea's locators will eventually be offered the citizenship of South Korea.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have become illegally crossing the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest boundary with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a strongly protected demilitarised zone between the Highs.
China treats smugglers as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and mostly restores them by force.
Further technically, the relations between North Korea and South Korea in the war have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang, and the discussions focused on the negotiations in the stations to break the nuclear equipment.
This followed the historic meeting of June in which President Donald Trump and Kim Jong met in Singapore and agreed on a general level of effort towards the nuclear armedness of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States of America for being stuck in the positions of sanctions after the meeting.
"There is no confidence in the United States on our national security is on a reliable basis, and in such circumstances, we will not in any case be subject to the first unanimity of our equipment," Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Your Nancy Fear calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysteer" and said it was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Your fear commented on a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t stop thinking that if a woman had acted like that, she would be called hysterical, your fear said his own reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied accusations that he would have sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in the power of his emotions, and sometimes he screamed and lost his voice when he told his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the democratic members of the committee without calling the accusations against himself as "grotesk and planned persecution against the person", organised by the liberals who were angry with the 2016 presidential election of Hillary Clinton.
Your fear said he believed Kavanaugh's witness statement shows that this is not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed him to be neutral to the Democrats.
“I believe he made himself inappropriate in his statements and in a way that he attacked Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
Your fear was wondering if he was asked if he would file a formal accusation against Kavanaugh if this choice was strengthened and if the Democrats were to get a majority in the representative room.
“Let’s say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not qualified not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the court in which he is currently working,” your fear replied.
Kavanaugh currently works at the US federal court of appeal.
Your fear added that as a democratic he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible provisions regarding the health reform or Roe v Wade, as Kavanaugh is known as a conservative prosecutor.
In consultations in connection with its confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not a good time for a hysterical and impartial person to be elected a member of justice and we would be expected to say that it’s amazing,” your fear said.
Women need to survive everything.
It is a legitimate fire speech over months and years of rage, and it cannot be kept without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, right?"
He continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that he also cried when he was angry, but he had developed a way to say to his spokesperson in a situation where he got angry and started crying:”You think I am sad now because I cry.
I'm really mad."
And then he continued.
And I thought it was genius.”
The tears are entitled to the explosion route of rage, although they are generally understood fundamentally misunderstanding.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a male office is when I cried out of rage and older woman - a cold-stricken boss I had always been afraid - grabbed me from the neck and pulled me into the stairs.
“Do not ever let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think that you are sad, and then they are happy because they have apologised your mind.”
Patricia Schroeder, congressman of Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
When Hart got caught in 1987 by a non-marriage boat named Monkey Business and got out of the race, Schroeder was very frustrated that there was no reason why he would not try to become president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
There were seven potential and the least needed one more.
Someone called the situation “Snow and the seventh dwarf.”
Since the campaign time was already long, he was behind the money collection and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he had a total of two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
It was clear to him that some of his supporters, who gave him a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
“Do they think I get a discount?” he thought.
When he took his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he became in power of his emotions - for his supporters of gratitude, for the frustration of the system that made it so hard to collect funds for the electoral or delegations, and for the sexisms - that he could not speak.
“I could have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder reminds me of the press’s reactions.
“I could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking I'd beat my tomb as a memorial.
"He cried."
How the US-China Trade War can benefit Beijing
The launch of the US-China trade war was overwhelming, and although the battle is all else than over, the country’s intervention can benefit Beijing in the long run, the experts say.
President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by setting import taxes on China's main export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting import goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), taxing effectively half of all products imported into the United States of China.
Beijing has responded to the same measure every time, lastly, five to ten per cent of customs duties for American import goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye style and does not seem to have the second largest economic volume in the world for a moment.
In order to get back to Washington, we should give up on our own requirements, but public worship would be too humiliating to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays their cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing dependence between countries.
“A long political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that start a economic crash in one of the countries and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than the side viewers have understood so far,” says Abigail Grace, an Asian Research Assistant Center for New American Security.
According to Syria's Foreign Minister, the country is "prepared" for the return of refugees
Syria says she is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country after the destructive war of more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country will improve.
“Your account is now more stable and safer due to the development of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to correct the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal situation.
The conditions now allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they had to leave due to the unilateral economic activities of terrorism and their daily lives and their livelihood.
According to the United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would be grateful for the assistance of the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that support the rebels.
The European team confirmed Ryder Cup's victory in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup in 2018 at the end of the US team at 16.5 against 10.5 Le Golf National field outside France.
The United States has now lost six times in Europe and has not won Ryder Cupia in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown on its own when its Danish Captain Thomas Bjørn team reached 1.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star player, Phil Mickelson, had trouble almost all the tournament, and he hit his start in the water at the 16th track, giving a match to Francesco Molinar.
Italian Molinari shines in all rounds and became one of the four players, who has been scored 5-0-0 since the tournaments began in its current form in 1979.
The result of the American Jordan Spieth was 5&4 of the European team’s lowest ranked player, against the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world’s top player, lost the result of 2 and 1 England’s Ian Poulter, who could now play the last Ryder Cupin.
The eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European in all time at 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a heavy year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have this victory.
It is about the team and I am glad that I could help," said Garcia moved after winning the European team.
He transfers the call to his countryman Jon Rahm, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2&1 in individual competitions.
"I feel great pride after winning Tiger Woods, and I woke up admiring him," said Rahm, a 23-year-old.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has Ryder Cup career record 13-21-3.
Outrageous statistics from one of the best players of all time, who have won 14 great wins and remain second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding routes throughout the weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was high throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. team said his team failed after the show: “I am proud of these friends, they fought.
We pressed the European team this morning in the games.
We're in trouble.
Respect Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We regroup, work with our American PGA and Ryder Cup and we move forward.
These 12 guys are fantastic and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to lift the hat.
We met our winners."
Situation of Red tide: concentrations decrease in the Pinellas, Manate and Sarasota regions
According to Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission’s latest report, there is a general reduction in spreads in Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, more fragmented rest areas are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manate, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The Red tide floral extends around 130 miles from Pinellas to the southern Lee County.
The boards can be detected ten miles from the Hillsborough County coast, but they are less than last week.
Red tide has also been seen in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported on the coast of Pinellas County in the past week, the concentrations varied from low to high hills in Hillsborough County, the background concentrations to high levels in Manate and Sarasota counties, the background concentrations to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County and the background concentrations to high levels in the shores of Lee County, and the lengths in the Collier district were low.
In the areas of Pinellas, Manate, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, breathing symptoms are still reported.
During the last week, Florida’s northwest did not become reports of respiratory symptoms.
