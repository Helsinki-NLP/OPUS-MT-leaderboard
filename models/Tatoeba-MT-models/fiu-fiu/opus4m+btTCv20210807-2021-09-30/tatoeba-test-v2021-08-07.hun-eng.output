I'm very busy at school.

I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half miles a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Is your mother at home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt about it.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we're over.
I'll take your place.
I'm going to work on a train every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
It could be better with your sister.
It's with my love that I feel for you.
It was much more than I expected.
The price is two euros.
There may be a problem.
It could be nice.
It would be a shame to see all that work damaged.
It's definitely overwhelming.
He didn't break.
I wasn't bad.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow didn't stop.
It's cool if you're coming.
He's not doing anything!
No matter who started it and why.
It doesn't look so complicated anymore.
It doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like I've been poured on me.
I just realized I misunderstood him.
It was the last day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of the last week.
This is exactly the day of our marriage, honey.
There had to be a reason for this.
It happened suddenly.
This happened when he was out.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
I have my own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think every fat man should diet.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.

I find her novel boring.
I think some movies fell out.

I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
Like I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's right.
The probability is very small, I think you'll be able to do it from yourself.
I think he's going.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.

I think you'd better go now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor may have died.
I think you're good with your neighbors.

I'll find the spiders for cute ones.
I think he's home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think that should be forgotten.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I think, so I exist.
I don't think it makes any sense to try to convince him.
I think you've done a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's enough.
I think this medicine will be good for you.
I think time will solve this problem.

I think you should go in personally.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your work is very good.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you weren't pretty persuasive.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went somewhere to eat, it'd make me feel fun.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was blowing up.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it wasn't.
I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still at home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
It hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under his influence.
It had a great impact on me.
This is dangerous.
It's a historic act.
It's hard to put it into practice.
It's hard for everyone to feel like.
It's hard for everyone.
I have doubts if it will work.
It's getting too late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's time for you to start a new business.
It is important that we propagate our language in all possible ways.
In fact, it's your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
It's wonderful.
It's lunch.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
I'm glad to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke marker cannot be turned off.
This is not the best solution.
That's not the right solution.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It doesn't fit to talk full of mouth.
It's snowing.
It's still moving.
Wow, it's really bad today.
It's so expensive.
Thirty metres long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's a very easy task for him.
It's on you.
This is a useful information.
In the night the heat is high.
It is very important to wash your hands thoroughly after you replaced the diaper of the baby.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark before we get home.
It'll be done by the time it's needed.
You'll be ready for the time you need it.
It will take a little time to get used to wearing glasses.
He'll be knocking down soon.
It will work when I replace polarities.
Consequently, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't need to be here.
You could use a shave.
Looks like you don't feel so good here.
Looks like you were thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
It matters.
It could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it.
Maybe I'm gonna be late.
You need to wash it.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
They must have stolen it.
We need to fix it.
It never existed.
It should never have happened.
But I lied to him that I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bicycle.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question, too.
I've been bathing for a long time.
I've been in the tub for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I went on the 58th road.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the zoo last night.
I took my shoes.
I totally forgot.
It would probably be cheaper elsewhere.
The rain broke out last morning.
It fell yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I work for two hours a day.
I travelled all over Russia.
I crossed the United States.
It actually works.
It's really sad.
I tried everything to keep her alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tomi.
I'd trust my life as well.
I'm trying to keep informed.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
Bigblown cat.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
A grey stone building.
This is a housekeeper dog.
It's half an hour for lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen.
It's totally dark outside.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
It's beautiful and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's ten o'clock at night.
One of my dreams was that I lived next to a river.
It's always the same.
Environmental disaster.
It's a dirty business, Watson, a dirty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a shame.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm sorry Tomi's leaving.
It's a pretty big carpet.
It's a nightmare.
It's cold.
This is just as much art as science.
It's the past.
He's in school.
A very dangerous sport where a small mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
Money polluting.
It's a strange question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was a fantastic trip.
This day is exhausting.
It's a hard day today.
This has happened before.
It wasn't exactly what week it was.
Two years ago he left me.
That's better.
It's better to ride the garden at night.
It's hot.
Oh, my God.
Get to a cheaper bus.
That's Chinese for me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sundays.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold at home.
I'm cold, I'm skinny.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
It is commonly known that the bear loves honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or not.
It's totally normal.
Okay now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
That's very delicious.
It's done!
It's easier to start than stop.
It's easy to be brave for a long time.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
Looks like the bus was late.
That sounds ridiculous.
It seems like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing has changed.
It looks very strange.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's not in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
Looks like you're honest.
Looks like you're wrong to me.
Looks like we're going to have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Dear.
It is fair to get the same salary for the same work.
It's not perfect.
It's far from the ideal.
This is yours.
You know, that's funny.
It's getting bored.
It's getting serious.
We're going to have a tough winter.
It's not gonna be easy.
You're lucky to see a dead star.
It's good to be warm.
It's good for learning.
I'm glad you could come.
I'm sure you're gonna laugh.
It's not hard to get to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe that time was clean and suny.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this city that can sleep on.
It's hard to put it in words.
It's hard to express in words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's delicately beautiful.
He's got an unequivocal head.
He's tall.
Children are already in bed.
Stop making money.
It's warmer than usual tonight.
That's illegal.
It's important.
It is important that parents stand on one side when they are raised.
It's important to help them get in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It is impossible to meet your expectations.
It is impossible to comply with your conditions.
I don't know what tomorrow brings.
It's incredible, you know?
This is inevitable.
That's inspiring.
It's just a feeling.
Just move on.
It's only a matter of time to get Tom in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice for you to take me home.
It's nice to say that.
It's late.
It's washing today.
It's like a submarine field, and the turtles over them and sharks like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic, the way he lives.
It's too cold for swimming.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's on me.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as bold as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
This won't happen.
It's not your job to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
No negotiation.
It's not so far.
It's not that simple.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you're doing, it's how you do it.
It's not worth crying about it.
I'm not talking to you.
I'm not talking to you.
I didn't tell you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't show repentance.
It doesn't make sense to be bitter in the past.
The snow's falling.
Obviously it's broken.
Obviously impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It doesn't matter if some of you are a farmer.
It's okay if you're gay.
“Three months passed, and Tomi says that he speaks the French fluently. — So, it’s at the top of the stupid thing. —What is the summit? — Dunning-Kruger effect.
Only three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's like I'm gonna pour it out of a jeeze.
He opened his wings.
It's incredible.
It's pretty persuasive.
It's quite simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these mysantropical theories is expressed in the apprehension of the working class, freeing imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars that it has engaged, and to believe the core of the thought that the causes of infinite wars are the congenital aggressive tendencies of man.
It's very urgent.
It rains in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
That's a big number.
He's right there.
It's unpleasant to ask someone how much he's looking for.
They say the Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
He's snowing in Boston.
It's so good to stay home.
It's still moving.
It's suicide.
It's technically possible.
That's the best book I've ever read.
That's the least I can do.
Theoretically possible.
This is the same for everyone.
The same old problem.
You have to answer that.
It's time to take our tent trees.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to cure the problem.
I need to cut my hair off.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's time to do something about it.
Tom has his birthday today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tomi is against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's expensive to me.
It's too hot for this now.
Too late.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's a typical autumn time.
It's a bad thing to get cold.
It's ugly, destructive yellow and nothing, but at least they don't fall in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think.
It's unlikely that anything serious will happen.
It now depends on them.
It's up to you that we're going there or not.
Very attractive.
It's boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
Very disturbing.
Very fun.
It's a lot to live here.
It's very nice of you.
That's very white.
It's hot.
That's the deal.
It's your only chance.

It took me a long time, but eventually it was found.

It was hot, and the time was humid.
It was just a trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.

It was not long before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
It was not a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy to keep my promise.
It was under the belt.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who cut the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't intentional.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't so bad.
It wasn't the first time they did this.
It wasn't Tom.
It was just a joke.

It didn't hurt.
It fell last night.
It was pretty weird.
That was really interesting.
It was really fast.
He was really sad.
It was a success.
That was great.
That's the only thing I could think about.
The worst pain I've ever experienced.
Tom's next.
It was kept completely secret.
He was unsure if he would marry him.
That was urgent.
In a few days, the whole thing ends.
It's gonna mess up in a few days.
In a few days, the whole thing will be over.
It takes five or ten years to complete technology.
This will grow back.
This will happen.
It'll fall for a week if tomorrow doesn't stop.
This will threaten the welfare of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
You don't have to do that anymore.
It doesn't take much time.
It worked beautifully.
It works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
It's hard for me to get out of here.
It would be meaningless.
It would have been better if it had been settled.
It's not brave, it's stupid.
It would have been better if we hadn't done it.
I underestimated Tom.
I get it.
I understand it's uncomfortable for you, but don't worry.
I understand what you're talking about, but I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand what you're saying, but it doesn't work.
I understand your problem.
I've updated my software.
I need a job right away.

I always wanted to meet you.
I was everywhere.
I got a blessing.
I've been coughing without stops since morning.
I've been sick all week.
I helped Tom out.
I hid behind the bar.
I've hidden something from you.
I was happy to wait for your arrival.
I've been looking for you.
