European inflation has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation in the euro zone is mainly due to a temporal increase in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro zone, the price increase in November was higher than expected, and after 2.6 per cent, the annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was registered, reported by the EU’s Luxembourg statistical office.
The official forecast is only 3% likely - Bloomberg said.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unprecedented from the US, British and Canadian flag bank, said that the reduction would lead to the development of inflation spiral with rising raw materials prices and mild unemployment.
The ECB would like to keep inflation rate at 2% but close to that.
According to a analyst, the ECB is in its twenty-twentieth trap: "We need to talk about inflation" so that it does not have to act on this subject later.
In Germany, the value of November inflation is 3.3 per cent as twelve-year records, and Spain has increased from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
The eurozone inflation has been sparked high by jumping food and energy prices.
During the periodic wheat quotations, the price of soya beans has increased by 88%, and the price of soya beans has been the highest since 1973.
It was also necessary to pay more for food oil and milk products in 2007.
The world market price of oil increased by 52 percent this year, and in the past month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation is jumping from 2.1 to 2.5% in 2008, but in 2009.
It is estimated that 12 monthly inflation remains around 3% in the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, the ECB expects the interest rate to be reduced twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After the long stagnation of Fidesz's supporters, he grew significantly from the beginning of December, so since 2002 he has the largest camp, while Gallup has not yet measured such a low 13% socialist support.
The difference between the Commissioners' voters - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) support for the support of the MSZP of fifteen (20%).
According to the survey, MDF and NDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their total population support is two percent.
Both of the supporters of the camp are one percent more among the voters.
The economic public voice could continue to deteriorate at the previous point of view - it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who considered the country’s economic situation to be extremely bad, while 46 percent of others have been quite bad.
The changes in their financial situation are now considered more pessimistic after spring and summer prospects.
For the next year, the majority of the population account for further deterioration and only ten improvements.
In December, more than 71 percent of Gallup’s previous surveys believed that the Prime Minister was rather poor than doing his work well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the respondents trust or trust very much, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of the supporters.
54% of governments do not trust at all, 27% of the Fides president.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much society thinks that it can be treated with the Prime Minister without a change of government.
While 35% of governments and government leaders considered the remainder of October’s disruptions to be desirable, this rate is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) only sees the solution in the new elections.
The 60% of those asked to answer the question of participation will be sure to go and another 20% say he would probably go.
As a comparison, only 55% would be involved in a "Now on Sunday-ordering national elections" and a further 15% would be likely to participate. The result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of the current intentions.
The study fees would be 74, 79, and 84 percent would say no to hospital daily fees.
If we only look at the same proportions of their participation in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would withdraw the introduction of tuition fees, visa fees and hospital daily fees.
The most expensive of Auchan, raised by nearly the fifth of Tesco
In the Budaörs commercial triangle, hypermarkets held an average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that this year the VAT has not increased.
Article of the Day Economy
This year the daily Christmas basket grew by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs commercial triangle, but each hypermarket has shown an increase of thousands of HUF.
Since last December, the prices in the food shops have already been "departed", so there was no drastic excitement per cent compared to the previous high base.
However, it is obviously scary for consumers that what they have received over nine thousand forints last year is not yet available for ten thousand.
The daily basket crossed the ten thousand forints of psychological boundaries at least 91 forints in the hypermarkets.
The highest basket value was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the basket came into 6800 forints.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost on the last year, but the turkey gloves, nuts, and mammals were heavily expensive.
KSH's data followed the price of flour and bread in the shops, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not lower the price of the product to less than 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of the two-litre returnable bottle Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so with the deposit fee, only 257 forints were requested for the product.
In addition, Auchan showed the most expensive in the solar basket this year, while Cora is the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora 15 compared to last year's Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices in the daily basket by about 18-18 percent.
Last year’s most expensive and cheapest basket value compared to this year, the difference was 12 per cent, whereas between last year’s cheapest and most expensive 21 per cent increases.
In Forint, there was an average of 1480 increases.
Last year, the average price increase came to 1206 forints, feeling the effect of price increases in VAT last Christmas.
This process is precisely abolished by trade, and apparently it was not possible for the stores to decide how much price they would use in one product, because they were unable to calculate the impact of price change on consumption.
(If the trader is poorly planning the speed of a product, it can bring significant benefits to the price adjusted to the intensity of traffic.)
The price increase in the daily basket was so extreme last year, that the price difference was more than 1720 forints in 2006, while the cheapest price difference was only 844 forints.
This extremist did not appear this year, because the most expensive 1630 forints now were more than last year, and the cheapest forint was expensive with 1284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophe price increase was shown, with over 30 percent of daily consumption in hypermarkets in less than 20 months.
(In any case, this does not necessarily demonstrate the KSH data: the Statistical Office has a price increase of more than 30 per cent in some basic foods over 12 months.
For example, besides the flour with the egg.)
According to the daily basket, this seems almost incapacity for the latter, as the price level of the fairly expensive product in the last year compared to the base was produced in the worst case by nearly 10 per cent price increases.
The flour suppliers are in a stronger position than eggs, and drastic price increases have been tricked on the multiply.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypers are not complaining, they are constantly reporting a good year.
According to our experience, the number of customers in the three shops visited is no longer interested in prices.
They buy a lot of food from everything, they take stacks of durable food.
In the morning of Wednesday, all three stores developed serious lines before the cash prices, because suddenly the number of visitors increased.
However, we know that traffic is weaker in the countryside, many complain about research companies that even their plans are missing revenue, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumption products.
In many places, they save disinfectants
More than a thousand infections have been registered this year in hospitals, mainly due to insufficient use of antibiotics.
The conditions of hygiene of hospitals, the congestion of beds, the overload of staff do not favour the stopping of infections, claims the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
They also save in many places in disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the traumatic class of John's Hospital.
After a serious accident, the antibiotic-resistant bacteria were shown in a man.
The patient was separated.
Similar infection occurred at the beginning of the year.
A serious car accident was released from the hospital, but soon later he had to return with MRSA infection, and he has not been able to perform an important surgery since then due to the bacteria in his body.
By December 10, 1094, hospital infection caused by a multiresistant pathogen was reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said head of the National Epidemiology Centre, Böröcz Karolina.
This means that the infection caused by so many multiresistant pathogens has certainly been registered in hospitals, not known about the rest.
Approximately two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria is carried by a third of people without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, inflammation of the almonds, skin infections, wound infections) are well respondent to antibiotics, can be well cured.
However, if antibiotics are used in excessively or inadequately, a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics develops a highly resistant bacterial against antibiotics that spread rapidly under inadequate hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or persistent malfunction of the immune system, severe hospital infections, such as infection or blood poisoning, may occur in patients with weakened organs, elderly or small weight.
According to the medical director of the John Hospital, there is nothing strange in the MRSA infection, such infections belong to the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be mixed with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there, said Nyulasi Tibor, where the presence of the pathogen is not examined.
Antibiotics are opposed
"We separate such patients, the nurse's staff delivers the patient in rubber gloves and masks, and they have the right antibiotics for their treatment," Nyulasi Tibor said.
Patients entering the hospital will first be examined whether MRSA is present in their body, but cannot always avoid infection.
Not fashion for sampling
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, however, current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable to prevent the development and spread of multiple-resistant pathogens, says Böröcz Karolina.
Once this infection occurs typically in hospitals, hospitals should check the invading patients and patients carrying MRSA should be immediately separated.
However, in Hungarian hospitals there is no fashion for microbiological sampling.
It also plays the role that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies.
Most cases will be so in the sun when the patient becomes infected with MRSA, said the head of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strong recommendations on the appropriate application of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the healing of individual infections and diseases.
An antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies should be carried out so that it does not develop resistance to drugs, but the hospitals do not comply with this in any case.
Microbiological samples are even more rare in the patient’s or primary care, Böröcz Karolina said.
Save in Disinfectants
Scientific evidence demonstrates that MRSA is most often covered by the mediation of healthcare staff from one patient to another.
Therefore, hand washing, gloves, mask use, but there are significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA spreads with cell infection, contact, but under domestic hospital conditions, there is always no possibility of separating the infected patient.
In fact, the hospitals are often crowded, often very close to beds, where patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other from the epidemic point of view.
Unfortunately, it is also experienced, noted Böröcz Karolina that in unfavorable material hospitals saving in disinfectants, few nurses, many patients, so even greater the chance of infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, there can be fewer such infections or stopping the prolongation of the pathogen.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection causes huge costs to health insurers, so they fight against them everywhere.
In England, for example, the government programme included reducing the prevention or occurrence of MRSA.
According to the evidence that the program is successful, the data provided indicate a decrease in trend of MRSA infections in England.
The European Disease Prevention Centre (ECDC) focuses on the development of multiresistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
She wasn't drunk by the police officer who caused a death accident
The official expert opinion was prepared for the death accident caused by the XXII Police Officer.
It can be ruled that it would have led in a drunken or contemporary state during the period of resignation of the post of the XXII District Police Commander, who gased a pedestrian to death, informed Morvai Attila, the spokesman of the Capital Prosecutor on Friday after his expert opinion on this matter.
The expert opinion supported the primary test result, which has already established that the former police officer did not consume alcohol before sitting behind the volcano.
At that time, the head of the XXII District Captain hit a 55-year-old man on the XXII District Kossuth Lajos street during a crooking on Tuesday, who did not want to cross the road beyond the designated pedestrian.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian did not cross the zebra, is not a mild condition under the CRESZ rules, and the car driver should also give priority.)
The pedestrian lost his life after transporting to the hospital.
Due to the events, the district police officer resigned from his post and asked to put him in peace, according to the police, because the case was so shocked.
The case will be investigated by the Budapest Investigation Authority.
Morvai Attila also argued that the former police officer was working with the prosecutors in the investigation from the beginning.
New EUR 400 million for infrastructure
He signed three credit framework agreements worth 400 million euros, with the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Veres János and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a €300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund (EIB) in 2006, of which 100 million credit agreements have already been concluded by the parties before, the Treaty now signed is about the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
Projects related to education also provide budgetary funding for the 150 million euro loan agreement.
The EIB has approved EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million may later be used by extending the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, a 50 million euros contract was signed by the parties, mainly for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
The 4th subway was also discussed in the meeting.
It was agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of submarine funding with the EU, they will return to whether and how to amend the original contract.
According to John Veres, this can take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded 113 projects with EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan coverage shall be provided by the EIB with no 8-year period of patience and no availability fee.
Bulgaria is the EU property paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astonishing - all Europe's attention is aimed at a few countries previously mentioned in the Balkans.
Where and who are buying the EU in the cheapest, but rapidly degrading market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most accessible East European property purchase destination is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains are the most diverse regions of Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the beach Albena, the Golden Coast, the "Napospart", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more are looking for accommodation in the area of Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will sooner or later raise the interest of investors - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, and more and more are buying in the area of the so-called cheap Rus.
The capital, Sofia also offers attractive opportunities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so in addition to the summer and winter season, it will be a priority for the other two seasons.
Foreseeable investors are therefore already buying largely, for example in Banszko.
According to analysts, Bulgarian customers are also seeking to change their lives and lifestyle.
Most customers are English, but come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cyprus investors are also present, and in the Black Sea and ski paradises there are traditionally many Russian buyers.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Residents or renovated properties are purchased at a price of €50 to €100 000 or destroyed old houses for €5 to €15.000 and then renovated.
It requires good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to have a major city, shops and usually local doctor's close proximity.
The second category is a holiday purchaser (Bulgaria was listed on the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is formed by business investors who purchase in the hope of medium or long-term value growth.
The cost of capital property is constant, as demand is becoming more and more strong.
In the European Union, the lowest property prices in Bulgaria have increased by 21% in the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially greater than the increase in payments.
Fodor and six Hungarian percent
According to Mr Gábor’s information on the environment and water, expert meetings will be completed on Tuesday, and on Wednesday after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers will continue with the negotiations of the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world discuss the Bali Road Plan, with efforts to reduce emissions by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
There is currently a strong debate between developing and developing countries.
The United States also indicated that it is currently not going to negotiate accurate numbers, although it is agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether developing countries are committed to reducing emissions as well as to providing both material and technological assistance to the countries that need it.
There was also an agreement on support for developing countries.
The support fund, which is owned by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by the Board of Directors of 16 members, is expected to be read in the Market and Profit within the United Nations Global Environmental Fund (GEF).
6% of Hungary
Mr Gábor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to preserve the role of a flagship in global climate protection efforts and promotes the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister explained that the EU is willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, regardless of the success of the post-2012 Convention, and is willing to take up up to 30% of mitigation if other developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to assume their responsibility and capabilities.
Fodor Gábor pointed out that in 1997, the countries acceding to the Kyoto Protocol targeted a 5.2% reduction, including the EU, which was still 15 Member States, took a minus 8%.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the period 1985-87, which our country will meet. - reminds us of the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
Balin is a high bet, since within two years the long-term international climate policy agreement should be covered, otherwise its entry into force would certainly be post-2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately follow a new international emission reduction system, which would be necessary in its latest report by IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize and the International Scientific Body on Climate Change.
This would lead to a delay in emissions reduction and an inevitable increase in Earth's average temperatures above 2 Celcius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely severe and irreversible consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
Records made from Iraq and Afghanistan are published at the video distribution by British Army Units, with which they promote themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) received the YouTube: the specialities operating in Afghanistan have been uploaded videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, BBC said.
These recordings with a miniature, helmet-mounted camera will be checked at the command of the air force in the Army of Candles and then sent to London, where the domestics upload them to the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
There were 139 recordings from the air force's soldiers on the internet in such a way, and their channels were viewed by over 75 thousand.
The British Ministry of Defenceheadquarters registered in spring 2007 and published videos on both Iraqi and Afghanistan’s actions, while the British Ministry of National Community (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeepers (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Initiation in Afghanistan
According to the original intention of the Air Force, he put videos for recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good to know the public the real purpose of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published in such a form is almost nothing compared to traditional, television recruitments - said to the BBC by Gordon Mackenzie's defense expert - but it also has an indispensable political message, as it demonstrates in a specific form the right of military action decided by the government.
The Americans did a game.
The army is also concerned that, along with carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are placed on the distributor, which, for example, show the death of the soldiers: in some hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, officers talk about losses, but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
By the way, many videos from the Iraqi and the Afghanistan military have been released on the internet, which were made on sharp launches, but the British army has only recently received it.
The Americans recruit a little differently, the free downloadable American Army with a shooting game in which the player can directly enter the skin of the soldiers within a more or less life-friendly simulation.
Tobacco and squirrel Christmas will be at the ministries
Minister of Labour Lamperth Mónika does not seem emotional: instead of Christmas, he will hold an annual work meeting for his colleagues who will be welcomed by a poga and coffee since 2007.
There is a ministry where living music will be a party, they will magic Christmas in the heart of the officials with tombs and cocktails elsewhere.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and Swedish - so fun is power.
The public offices are also ready for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party of the Ministry is held this year by the Home Protection Wallet, but the HM is not waiting for the Ministry of Workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers are given gifts, and at the Mission Christmas, the members of the soldiers currently serving foreign missions are hosted, but also held a press reception.
The wallet is 25 million for the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) are dismissed from other wallets.
GKM's party is held in the future house, totalling 4 320 000 forints, and about 350 guests are expected from the six hundred ministries.
At the celebration of the wallet, they will stick to the Christmas mood, but there will also be performers and tombols.
The Christmas of the NFÜ was held in 4 700 000 forints, and in the building of the National Justice Council (OIT) on Wednesday, there were concerts and dinners.
The landscape cost one million forints, spent on over four hundred invites.
We know that one class of NFÜ is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is done by an application management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre.
For this purpose, the building of the Theatre was rented.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the competent.
You don't need a suit
The OIT building saw not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Luca Day party on December 7, instead of Christmas.
He did not ask for money for the use of the OIT halls.
Fifty hundred people participated in the ball.
The party started with the minister's greetings, and it was possible to dance for live music after dinner.
The [origo] question was said: the ball was not at all mandatory for the evening dress or suit.
Puritan party is held by the health, employment and municipal wallet.
The Ministry of Health organises a show and celebration in its own building for employees for 400 000 forints.
Lamperth Mónika, however, is not formally waiting for a Christmas party, but for the end of the year's work meeting.
They expect hundreds of hundreds of guests, who - the press department - will only receive coffee and pogace, so the party will be released from forint 350,000.
On the other hand, the Minister of Municipality of Baghinai Gordon will simply cook with his colleagues at the Aucate of the Ministry of Municipality and Rural Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) held a Christmas meeting in its own large hall, waiting for 436 employees.
Every guest has 2500 forints for Christmas party - the sum of a Swedish bet and a cake.
Since John Veres is the minister, the employees of the PM are like Christmas every year.
But it will not be a celebration, but the formality will not only be strengthened by the minister’s speech, but also by the afternoon time.
The farming wallet will give a new year-on-year bet on January 20th, and the Ministry of Christmas will be missed.
The bet is held in Vajdahunyadvár, Cityliget, and according to the wallet, for 100 guests, 1000 forints per head.
This, according to the press class, will be a very simple standing bet, for which only foreign graduates accredited to Hungary are official.
These annually organized bets begin with a short ministerial greeting and end with a retreatful falsification.
There is no Christmas party at all at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture - said to [origo] in the competent press departments.
The price of the office Christmas of the environmental wallet was not mentioned in the press department.
Of course, more than four hundred people were invited to the party held in the Museum of Industrial Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are growing up
On Friday, the National Association of League Professional Organizations and the National Association of Working Councils will be established by their strike committee coordinating the indefinite-time strike.
On Saturday, the General Assembly is banned, and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on health insurance law, the dismissal begins.
The operation will certainly lead to a significant deterioration in transport, as rail transport will almost completely stop and will strike at the BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League Professional Organizations will describe the details of the Monday strike organised jointly with the National Association of Working Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which will coordinate Monday activities.
On Saturday, a general meeting is banned and from Monday, organizations joining the strike will terminate the work for an indefinite period if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been designated - on the day of the parliamentary vote on health insurance law - the date of the end of the initial strike.
If the National Assembly fails to adopt the Health Insurance Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
However, if the legislation is voted in favour, the strike committees will meet and decide on the continuation.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that the health insurance law will be voted only in late evening or perhaps in night hours.
Due to the strike that begins on Monday, it can be expected to be significant infarctions in transport: for a time unspecified by the railway, some of the public transportation in Budapest may be stopped in the morning, more than half of the Volán companies.
At the same time, there will be a halfway shutdown at many points in the country.
A number of trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, and the list of these are constantly updated on the home of League.
Some organizations have indicated a strike for an indefinite period, others have announced a temporary dismissal.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Association of MÁV and Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on a sufficient service, while more and more travelling on the railways near Christmas holidays.
According to the current communications, the LIGA Electrical and Heat Energy Professional Organizations, the Pedagogical Organization and the Pedagogical Professional Organization of Pedagogs, called for a 2 and 8-hour session at BKV, Budapest Airport from 13 hours to 9:00 a.m., four-hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationally, in changing times, with a two-hour warning strike in the health and social sector (EDDSZ).
The four demands expressed by League are key to revoking the government's proposal for health insurance reform and letting a new concept of social debate.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce a new pension calculation method from next year.
The third is to ensure that early retirement can be accessed to the system in the workforce that deserves prior to 2010.
The fourth reason for this action is that the Free Trade Organisation of Railway Workers of the League Trade Union (VDSZSZ) does not accept the offer of rail wings by the Ministry of Economic and Transport is expected to offer another offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard raised the country's risk
In support of the Movement for Better Hungary, the Hungarian Guard set up in August this year has raised the political risk of Hungary and the region according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division.
In the "risk warning" of the company, the biggest political risk for the activities of the Hungarian Gárda is that "in the short term, even with the intensification of ethnic tension between the gypsies and the non-citizens in Hungary, there may be violent ethnic conflicts."
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is supposed to promote such a action - the research institution added.
As it has been written, this can be led to one of the main failures of Hungarian political actors: "The public debate of the Roma has been allowed by public actors to transfer to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who could build a political strategy against the Gypsian-Hungarian."
This deepens the problem, inspires normal dialogue, strengthens extremes and increases the probability of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the Research Institute, the Hungarian Gárda’s activity, as a result of a major domestic and international media observation, "was significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the stability of the country and its democratic development".
They recall that since the autumn of 2006, the radical and extremist groups in Hungary have been reorganized as a part of the reorganization of radical and extremist groups that since the summer of 2007, more and more organizations called the “national self-defense” association were established in Hungary.
"The common feature of these compacts is to define themselves as a civil society, while they openly announce their members, either armed, to be prepared to protect (catastrophic, national defence, police and police), and to refer to the inconvenientity of the state," he said.
It has been noted that this is done according to the method that, based on the political and impartiality of society, aims to put different political efforts into a civil cloth.
Citizenship and the form of association are therefore not just a means of avoiding legal failures in the case of these associations, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries are also referring to Hungary as a potential source of danger, and some neighbouring countries’ ultranationalist political players want to prove their own anti-English policy by referring to the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region," they said.
According to the Research Institute, the formation of the Hungarian Gárda is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
As it was written, the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007.
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass roma disruptions that have occurred in one quarter of Sofia (Craszna Poljana).
BNU decided to build the gard, saying that the organization aims to "national self-defense".
In the last 17 years, they believe that there was a "cigareterror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained untrue and indifferent - reminds me of the political capital.
He added: the initiative had a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it has been written, an increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts indicates that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they are creating their own guard on resistance.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard has shown similarities with the functioning of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is therefore not possible to rule out that the Romanians in Hungary respond to the threat by organising their own self-defense - can be read in the policy capital risk warning.
Attila Juhász, Director of Political Capital’s research, said to be interested in the telegraphy office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As he said, they will publish their risk analysis every year, and if they experience something that may affect the change of the risk, they will inform the public as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Not a red letter everywhere in the holiday
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the red letter days, and around the holidays it has become a general practice of working day-changing, which will be less than next year.
It is not a single holiday in the EU and America.
The Hungarian legal system differs from national and state holidays and working hours.
Working holidays are mostly linked to church holidays, significant historical events.
We also celebrate the new year: the last day of the ancient year and the first day of both work breaks - the latter is just to rest.
We have a total of 11 red celebrations throughout the year.
The National Celebration of the Revolution of the Revolution of 15 March 1848 and 23 October 1956, also the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, we celebrate the state, on 1 May, and on 1 November and 2 November, we remember our relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two-day holidays for Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our public, national or just religious holidays are rarely going to fall on the weekend, working day shifts have become practiced in cases where we work only one day before or after the red letter holiday.
True, the price of the extended weekends is that we will not stay away from the workplace school in the previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day before or after the holiday is precisely when it should be processed has been regulated by the Minister for Employment for many years by a separate regulation.
The legislation covers all employers and employees they employ, public employees and public service partners.
It does not, however, affect companies, institutions, companies and institutions operating on a break-up day at the same time as the operator and its purpose without interruption.
This year’s work schedule changes only around the end of the year: from 24 December, life is almost stopped in the country, as the experience suggests that the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve are most people’s “success” or use their spared freedom for this purpose.
In the next year, more holidays will fall to the middle of the week and end, so the shift will be less than this year.
First, the work holiday is transformed around the calendar so that workers can stay at home for four days, depending on each other.
It will be a Saturday working day on April 26 to be replaced by Friday 2 May.
The second relocation relates to the holiday of October 23: on October 18, it will be necessary to work on Saturday instead of Friday 24.
However, the end of the year can take full time in the holiday next year, as from 24 December, the nonstop break is almost everywhere even if it falls on the New Year's Eve Wednesday.
Six frightening little things to upset your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice-post messages that we never get are innocent lies that we don’t notice almost any more: they “color” the everyday workplace.
Question whether you get used to small discomforts or pick up gloves and consciously avoid misunderstanding situations to others.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you you were looking for the marketing class," said one of your colleagues.
That's why you missed a meeting?
In the best case, you regret and try to make it right, you might call the marketing class to tell you, you forgot to pass the message (this is a less unusual solution).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before awkward apologies take place, it is worth considering what it is that you can get your colleagues unpleasant minutes and try consciously to avoid it.
Do you buy something that's not yours?
There's no more annoying than when you're hanging on for a document, office or your phone, and it's not anywhere.
Remember that you put your firefighter on the table last night, but in the morning, he had a leg?
Maybe you're gonna cover up the pen that you think was lost on one of your colleagues' desk?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without request because they will be legitimately angry with you to steal their property.
Don't put your pockets on the office envelopes, post-its, because it may be uncomfortable if you're running out of time, and you'd need it immediately.
Are you rumoring about the private life of colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the rumor.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t tie your colleagues to the nose about their privacy.
If one of them shares the deepest secrets with you, do not live back with his trust.
Destroy the hearings in yourself and do not negotiate with your colleagues in his absence, even if others know about your colleague’s stuff.
Are you improperly a patient?
When you call into the office and you mean a patient with diaper headache because you feel bad, or you feel like resting the day; think that your work, your postponing, your deadlines must be done instead of you.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that the next day you won't go into the office, or you can come in with something that you have to stay home, indicate that your colleagues and your boss are not faced with your shortcomings the next day.
Squirting, Squirting, Phoneing
Did you get into the job, but is it hard to get rid of colleagues?
Are you unwillingly witnessed to a phone conversation that would have been better not heard?
Don’t disturb your colleagues by twisting, singing, talking with a loud conversation (which you’re going on over their heads) or by twisting your legs, continuous twisting, loud discomfort.
They can all be disturbing, even if they are not embraced in a single project (writing, planning, organisation).
Are you blaming others for mistakes?
If you don't have anything for time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, don't blame for forgetting.
Don’t refer to any chaos that may prevail in the office, your louder colleagues.
Admit it if you made a mistake, and there was a disadvantage for someone else, and eliminate the curtain.
Ask me how you can make your mistakes right, replacing the failure.
Do you feel too homey in the office?
Cats and pants: comfortable wear for home, but it's not suitable for the office!
Don't pull a comfortable fireplace if your work permits you.
Don't be shiny, colleagues, and respect yourself by going to the office in ordinary clothes - if your job requires you to do it, pretty, elegantly.
If you want to answer, you're no longer interesting.
Squirting with the car in the usual morning trawl.
There's something special from the radio: a violin voice associated with electronic effects.
I'll roll up the volume.
Music has become a tempo and the bass arrives next to previous sounds, and then a female choir is connected as a real jewelry.
The Zagar Wings of Love is on mr2.
For a long time, the musical life in the country has not comforted us with a high-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems to be quite different when you listen to the new Zagar record.
The appearance of Yonderboi, some new and exciting productions coming from home digital underground, slowly changes the overall image, and in vain fashion again in the guitarist garage rock, the domestic electropop proves that it is new during the sun.
Zságer Balázs began from Pécs, and he played in Yonderboi band until, perhaps, two bucks didn't fall in a trail, he took his own way.
With its project (Zagar) and its music that combines the elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, it began to break through when film soundtracks were asked to compose (e.g.
Turkish Ferenc Sezon).
The formations played in smaller clubs initially were described by a wider audience when the first album of the wan2 magazine 2002 was listed among the fifty most important domestic records, and Zagar, Yonderboi’s company, called it to be the most marketable domestic trendmakers.
No doubt, Zagar and his band became "structured", but of course no one asked them if they would like to wear the label.
The band reacted as it had to: he created a new, better album.
The newly published album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity with the initial years of pécs.
Zságer Balázs was one of the old bands.
We would be in place with the airline, airlines, but in addition to the airlines of music, the effects of the louder guitar, rock and roll appeared, according to the spirit of age, according to its trend.
In these songs, at the Millennium premiere of the album, the singer Ligeti György, who currently worked with the Puzzle band in England.
The album also produced a real radio slager, the Wings of Love’s big songs recorded by the six home singers (Underground Divas) from the morning to night.
It's all right (?)
The Hvg.hu Zságer Balázs asked.
Hvg.hu: This new slogan now asks the question: how is the layer that you have left?
Zságer Balázs: The definition of layer music, for me does not mean too much.
I think there are two types of light music boxes; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, nothing-speaking, and they can be prepared to sell in the same way that makes them commercialized.
But you can also have a good pop from a genuine initiative.
The host’s attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language and national borders.
Hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience for your music?
Zs.B.: There are bigger traditions of light music, especially from us to the west.
There is not only the age of the age of the age of the twelve, but also the older.
They are much more closely monitored by light music changes around them because they are also considered part of contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people go to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is more visible on the concerts, where the effect already works on each other, but it only lies in the unacceptable changes of the moment.
However, I noticed that if you want to answer the audience, you're no longer interesting.
Hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked solo and built his career more west of us.
Zs.B.: We are not really going on his way, no matter how they sometimes try to explain it to our music.
We are more team players who trust the other music presence and let it open.
First of all, it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi's music, because more of us came out of his band and left on another road.
Hvg.hu: At the top list of mr2 Petőfi, Wings of Love was first placed.
Many have first heard the name Zagar.
Did you open the most popular style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit and then sell the plate.
This song is about more.
We were meant to be the final of the album, which we tried to unleash the audio orgy and the harder topics on the disc.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose six singers?
Why are they - what was the rule?
Zs.B.: The idea was to be a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of compiling this choir from the good speakers of our own musical sculpture.
This was how the six-year-old choir - that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci - was baptized as the underground Divas.
Hvg.hu: Have girls designed or shaped the song like that?
Zs.B.: The number has long existed in an instrumental version, and then when the disc was compiled, we thought there was something else to do with this number.
The moment was attracted to my voice.
Even that night I sang the song that the girls later learned.
It was almost first and scary spontaneously.
I remember that she was very lighted at the time, but of course the Dives had to do it.
It wouldn't have worked so strong with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the disc and on the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There is no solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing together and are not louder than music, so music is not just accompanied by their songs.
They were in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were behind the back was just because of technical problems.
However, it is aware that we didn’t want to share solicits.
The number is also about forgetting a bit of our ego who came from where he is going, just let those certain wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
Hvg.hu: What was the most work with?
Zs.B.: There were not really any pieces that were more difficult than mixing.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play a race piano, or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for long, and then it was slowly all in place like a scratchy game.
Hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number for the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concert and by letting the disc go.
Now the Prophet is a Fool, the Escape from The Earth and the Never The Same.
The betrayal broker risked billions because of a minority feeling
It's a disgusting glitter.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French Sociéte Générale banker, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because Kerviel lost almost 5 billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to catch his colleagues.
In contrast to the other banks, he recognized the crisis of the US mortgage market in time.
"Slow mental ability," she said from the police officers.
However, as the French Le Monde reported, Kerviel’s statement shows that at the end of the year, he has earned a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his shops.
Crime not only in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he said.
During the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
The opportunity was already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were news that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages to customers with low income or past recovery problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe in this and made me a good horse.
The annual profits reached €1.6 billion.
“As long as I was looking for the first half billion, I didn’t know how to report it,” Kerviel admits and adds that he didn’t hold anything for himself.
In his confession, he recognizes that he has falsified his reports in such a way that it cannot be discovered.
He also managed to cheat on his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange began to be interested in his transactions.
The risk was profits
Are you afraid to find out everything?
I'd rather not.
“I thought that only the fact that I was looking for $1,6 billion for the bank would calm them.”
Where did you want to risk so much?
His position was gradually achieved.
He worked in the Société Générale bank since 2000 after the University of Lyon.
His annual payment moved around $55,000.
Two years later, he was a broker assistant, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with a payment of $90,000 per year.
However, he knew that he would never be looking for as much as others.
“In 2005, during my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me with a bad eye.
For my graduates, my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the detectives.
Shortly after his entry, the first big success came.
Due to Allianz's shares, he sought half a billion euros to fall in these shares during the bombings in London.
And it started a lavina - she wanted more.
As long as you're looking for, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses said they knew everything or thought more about it.
"As long as I earned money, I lost my eyes."
But there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
In one day, he lost billion euros.
He wanted to shower in the middle of January.
When he started working on Monday, he no longer worked in the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that he lost $5 billion because of it.
And how did they figure it out?
He became suspicious because of his freedom.
“I only took four days last year.
The broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to see his reports,” Kerviel finished.
Czech Republic 365 billion
The Czech government ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic will have 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroons) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can acquire from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The regions will have about 125 billion kroons from seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to obtain a sum of around 100 billion kroons from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme.
Most money, 150 billion crowns, is aimed at transportation.
The Transport Programme is the largest operating programme and 22% of the funds available for the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base of the Transport Infrastructure, which will be borne by 90.8 billion kroons next year.
The Entrepreneurs and Innovation Program helps entrepreneurs and companies win tools for innovation companies.
Companies should also acquire resources to introduce new technologies, industrial research, but more efficient organisational methods.
In winning the EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least successful in the new countries.
Nicaragua's ex-President of 20 years of prison has approved the court
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeal approved 20 years of prison sentences to Arnold Aleman, the former president of the country, which was sentenced to 100 million dollars (maximum 1,8 billion kroons) in 2003.
Later, he was released from prison and lived in house arrest near the capital.
The fact that the former leader of this Central American country between 1997 and 2002 is to return to the grids, according to the AP news agency, it is still not clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez, it will depend on the prison’s leadership whether Aleman’s punishment will be deployed or returned to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alexandra that he regularly referred government funds to foreign companies in Panama.
These fictional companies and their account numbers were their relatives and their closest supporters in reality.
Some of these funds were subsequently funded by the Foundation, which was funded to finance the 2001 electoral campaign in Alexandra.
Approved our budget
That's right.
They accepted the state budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget adopted by the coalition majority by this government without the support of the opposition.
This year he went through with the support of the Social Democrats last year, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not accept it.
Notwithstanding the unconfidence of the government, no drama has happened this time.
This was generally ignored by the House, although the most influential law.
This is a certain contradiction.
Every government starts and ends in some chapters and headings of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the government and opposition's powers.
This is more grateful in the press, so you get much more attention in the media.
Political debates are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The government budgets of the former Social Democratic Governments have been struggling with three deficiencies, which the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high proportion of the law of mandatory, so-called commissioner expenditure, which is not only the pension, but also social benefits which the silent "coalition" of ČSSD and KSČM approved last year before the elections.
The second is the first result of deficit management.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficits of the budgets of cities and flights.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This is under public and relative control.
Timed bombs are the deficits of the budget of cities and flights.
Many mayors may also receive other investments other than taxes, fees and bank loans, and often have issued bonds that have disproportionately sold by their city houses.
In recent years, these debts have been redeemed by the mass sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks, which were obtained from privatisations from the state.
There is no such source now.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase like the rest of the world for a few years, which the Czech Social Democratic Party has constantly praised.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to correct public funding.
Instead, the country is increasingly debating debts.
The rest of the countries have been more intelligent than Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, Czech Republic.
This is primarily a disgrace of previous governments.
We belong to countries which are the least threatened by poverty in the global dimension.
For example, there is no need for enormous social programmes which have, unfortunately, in recent years become gigantic.
Although this year it was possible to eliminate an unreasonable part of the unreasonable population expenditure approved before the elections, even if the next year there is no withdrawal of the retirement limit and retirement reform, then any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever is to govern, it will be only formalisation.
With a little overwhelming it can be said that most of the government politicians taxed money usually become their mechanical distributors for retirement and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop cutting off the costs of the regular expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not taken everything that could have been done in the past decade.
If we do not really want to become pure officials from governor politicians, we need to be patient and we need to wish to prepare further reform laws for this is not too strong and conscious coalition government that the state can only give out as much as it can obtain from taxes and taxes.
This is the only way to progressively achieve the balanced budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the Central Bank of Canada have decided to fight the crisis of the financial markets jointly.
The money market costs more than $100 billion through the stock exchange.
This stock exchange raises the interest rate on the bank for which they are ready to lend money.
For example, US Fed gives $40 billion to the stock market and makes 25 more available to the European and Swiss central bank.
After the 11th September attacks, first the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl, an economic Outlook Group consultant, wrote.
"The coordinated operation of central banks in the United States reduced the probability of recession from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added.
Banks already lost $60 billion in the United States due to unpaid loans.
Elements are still expected to be billions of losses.
“Central banks can really fear what can happen if they have decided to do so,” said ABN Amro’s chief intermediary Kieran Davies.
It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing their loans, they will also give their customers more expensive loans.
This would reduce the need and reduce the US economy to recession with the potential consequences of global economic growth.
The central banks decided that LIBOR, a reduction in the interbank supply rates in London, which are used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual money lending, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have reduced their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
"This will have a similar effect to the further reduction of interest," Reuters told news agency Greg Salvaggio from the Tempus Consulting company.
Some analysts do not believe that the action of central banks contributes to the resolution of the crisis, as it does not solve the underlying problem, the fall in the American real estate market.
Klaus: Incredible discussions of ecologers
Global climate change is the most threatened by developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus has reiterated his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, the UN has criticised its international conference on climate change.
The book “Blue” presented in Vienna, not the Green Planet, has said that ecologers’ debates are incredible.
Klaus believes that the structure of the conference is not only unacceptable, which is a special mix of governments and representatives of civil society organisations, but also a fundamental difference between the retoric and reality accompanying it.
"The debate there absolutely impropers the structure, it's just throwing words, which are complementary to the solution of current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that he was very important for his subject and therefore so committed to this issue.
He also expressed his satisfaction that the book appears in German translation, as he said, “I often meet my opinion’s caricatures.”
Now, interested ones can read their undistorted opinions.
Klaus reminded me that although he is not a climatologist, he believes that he has sufficient ground for writing such a book.
Because he was able to monitor and evaluate professional meetings as academies in the statistics and economists.
In addition to the conclusion of the book, all scientists have not agreed that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, therefore, that climate change is constantly changing, and that the efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, the use of uncertified opinions to others is unacceptable, which it perceives as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained to the questions of the presenters that “he is not against the reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant enviromentalism, which does not take account of the relationship between costs and their benefits.”
Klaus has spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand were unable to replace their licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers have missed the deadline and could not replace their old license in time, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today’s last day is when you can still request the exchange, so that the agencies can set out the new license at the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will enter the road without valid rights after the new year.
According to the agencies, the licence was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While flights represent a severe fall in interest in licensing exchanges, capital offices have been disrupted with applications for licensing exchanges, which interest has increased this week.
The mayor's office receives about 2,000 customers a day.
It takes about half an hour to be in line.
In Prague, the license was not replaced by around 140000 drivers.
The issue of a new license lasts for 20 days.
However, the new licence may also be required with a short term of five days.
However, in this case, the driver must pay more than five hundred crowns.
Those drivers who are unable to carry out the compulsory licensing by the end of the year and are going on a road with an invalid license will be threatened by punishment from January.
The culprit must pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police may arrange the withdrawal by agreement.
In the case of public administration, the punishment is 2500 crowns.
Based on the previous information from the city house, you can also receive a fine who is not traveling anywhere.
They say you can pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously called for offices to be apologised and to impose up to a thousand crown punishments.
According to Karel Hanzelka, the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
He believes that the license is a document for which people can decide whether or not.
This is not a personal certificate that must be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive, should cancel the license.
Enough to be taken or recommended to send it to the appropriate office.
At the end of the year, the licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers need to gradually replace other types of driving licences.
People who have documents between 1994 and 2000 can replace them for three years.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the punishment of investigatives in Berdycchel
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík were suspected of confrontation with David Berdych's crime co-operation, and were sentenced to three and ten years of prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague has determined that one of them has reduced their sentences for two years.
The Praha Organized Crime Division was originally threatened by 14 and 12 years of prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today’s decision, but only the Supreme Court may request a review.
Although Berdyche is also suspected in this case, he is only waiting for the first instance.
In other cases, more than 16 years have been punished.
You can't get any more.
In January, the Court of Appeal found 19 people to be prosecuted in robbery attacks, of which the Supreme Court today negotiated 16 appeals.
Most of the accuseds refused to start the investigation by saying it was a speculative case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, police members after the agreement with Berdycce, criminals were provided with information from police sources, covered each robbery attacks and helped the band to avoid imprisonment.
The band therefore gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koňaři.
It is about the crimes of the band between 1999 and 2001.
First of all, there are robberies that have often suffered serious health damage, but also the abuse of public authority and unauthorized arms.
Because the police found illegal weapons, steel-seed shots, laser controllers or machine guns during the search.
According to the accusation, the band exploited tens of millions of crowns with the robbery.
In this case, the 20-man bands have already been legally recognized by the courts from Berdych's other robbers and many others.
Other members of the Berdych environment will testify before the court in other cases, and some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first-grade trial has so far avoided Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are under prearrangement in Ireland, waiting for a final decision on their release for criminal proceedings to the Czech Republic.
Account for Child Exchange: 12 million
For children exchanged in maternity, the lawyer of the victims of families, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Třebíč, demands 12 million crowns of pain plus court expenses.
Three millions of mothers, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, disagrees fundamentally with the proposal of Ondřej Dostál Veleba.
"We reject this claim because it's too much," Doss said after today's trial.
“In order to make an opinion on the contraindication, we need an expert opinion developed by the opponent.
We will determine whether there is any value to be used.
But we maintain our opinion that it will be measured in hundreds of thousands for everyone,” Dostal stressed.
He believes that the amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč to the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month until he raised their own biological daughter.
She served with a expert criticism on the basis of reimbursement negotiations, which was developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to psychologists and psychiatric experts, children’s parents suffered various degrees of mental harm and stress.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they encountered an eyelash that had not prevented the newborn exchange.
Women struggle worse with the current history of experienced trauma and what is happening right now, he has put together the content in Veleba.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the birth of třebíč on December 9.
Last week, children returned to their blood-based parents - Nikola Čermák to Přibyslavica, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanov to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Vysočina’s executive leader Miloš Vystrčil gave families 100,000 crowns to replace their expenses, which were due to the error of the hospital in Třebíčské, which was controlled by the visit.
All Czech hospitals have compulsory insurance under the law.
In case of misconception, they must apply to the reserve base, in exceptional cases they may request the founder’s assistance.
The courts have so far granted relatively low compensation for people, the amounts were calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, exceptionally few million crown tables.
Polivika has lost the kingdom of Variansko
Bolek Polívka has lost a trial for the title of the Kingdom of Válánsko.
According to the judge of the court of Tartu, although he first used the name of King Vanchi, but the project was developed by a team working around Tomáš Harabiš, who collaborated with the actress.
Polivika did not attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is probably not over and the customer will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabiš and his team living in the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
He believes that in the words of the Kingdom of Valach, everyone is actor-comic idea.
This opinion is also shared by Harabiš.
“We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Finding money and finding action," he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is money.
“In the years they found out that the project could succeed and win something from it.
They want to live from our work," he added.
Revenue business
According to the court, the name of King valachi was first used in the television show by Polívka.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned it.
At that time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a spiritual kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing valachi passports.
The original student act was formed a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, after which Harabiš founded the creation of a society of the Kingdom of Vānsko.
In 1997, with the consent of the name and signature of Polívka in passports, and also the benefits of these owners when visiting their farm and theatre lectures.
Who takes the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš has used the idea itself only to publicize Polívka in Manesia.
“Boleslav Polívka’s popularity helped the project of the Kingdom of Valachi,” the judge said.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was the Harabiš and his team on that intensely involved.
The co-operation of today's confronted parties continued until 2000, when the official coronation of the Harabiš Polívka was organised in Vsetín.
Since then, disputes between Polivika and Harabis have accumulated, which were confronted with the release of King I. Boleslav, “ever elected.”
In the kingdom, the leading role of Harabiš was taken into Jarmila Šuláko as a mother queen.
In 2002, Polívka Harabiš and his associates filed a trial against which the court rejected today.
The war planned by Harabiš could bring light into the debate for the throne and for the half of the queen.
This fight should be a new king.
The details and the date have not yet been betrayed.
“We don’t want to catch anything.
This should be something like the Slovácko King's Championship.
The king should be elected for a determined period.
Mr. Polívka may also be calm," he added.
Test of 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: disappearing prejudices
Honestly, I never liked Peugeo 206.
The characteristics of the flight are nothing strange, the quality of the change, leadership and production can be used as under averages many times.
But the successor already present on the market, Peugeot 207 is much better.
And the comb called SW goes a little further, so I have no choice but to think more about it.
When I tested Peugeot 207 classic hatchback, for example, I complained in the back seat of the head left.
This time, the complaint is over, as the combi armor means that the two metres of giants are not suffering in this regard.
In the world
I'll get through the interior soon so I don't repeat myself a lot.
This is a relatively good design, where my only objection is to the poor console.
I would appreciate some more designer inventions here if the car's appearance is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short bottom of the seat or arms.
The side management has also improved significantly against model 206.
As far as the area is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the armor.
In the comb, the head disappears in a few places already mentioned.
Skins in the trunk
In this vehicle, the most important is the package.
This is very accessible (i.e. thanks to the driveable back window) and should be considered a spacious space.
The empty places are equipped with reservoirs, which are ideal compromises.
They are not in the way, they are dispersed and they can handle harder objects.
But let's stay at the volume a little bit.
This is based on the tables in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is rather an average value against competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, the most sought vehicle of such a class is not against Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW to the product of the new boleslav generation of the mlda, then we find that Peugeo is well missed behind many 52 liters.
For a foreign holiday or incorporating a baby car, this value is almost critical.
But if I have to highlight the positives, I need to mention the almost completely straight floor after the rear walls of the second line or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The vehicle we tested was supplied with a four cylinder engine with an output of 1.6 litres of 88 kW.
And in truth, that's how you should look like a thousand hundred of people who drive a family hatchback.
Silent, small consumption and mainly pulls.
If we compare it to the Škoda-compliant, which often affects as if it had been wrapped into his escaper, I can only be pleased with it.
The price is high
The car price is not cheap.
However, we need to remember that we tested a car with spacious interior space and very good engines.
The car is still going for 329 900 Kč with a four-stroke alien engine.
The car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment will throw the equipment with an additional 80,000 Kč.
But we even had our headphone bags, our automatic climate, our automatic window deletion, our back windows were electric remote control....
That means that the car will cost 531 900 Kč.
This is a lot, but count your Fabia supplement and get a very similar result.
So there's nothing left but a brand-side decision.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is unsuccessful
In British schools, more and more children in Eastern Europe are concerned about the further development of local schools.
Integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing many obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases when disputes between immigrants and children of domestic residents became violent.
The problems related to the integration of Eastern European children are well shown in a case in the Northeast, where discussions between their seats and Slovak immigrants are increasing.
Difficulty between students, bondages are also characterized by the relationships of parents.
The situation was so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who said a ten-year-old student with a railway.
The guilty defends him by insulting him with racist secrets.
The police also had to go after the attack of two twelve-year-old girls on a Slovak immigrant.
Girls say that the man was embroidered with racist comments and thrown with stones.
“When we went home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started to spit on us.
When I told him to stop doing this, he hit us with apples and nails, and then reveals his naked back,” the mother of Slovak students wrote the new unpleasant case for The Times.
There are complaints on both sides.
One of the local residents has classified the debates on Eastern European immigrants as a survival struggle.
The cases mentioned above suggest that in British schools the mood between locals and immigrants begins to become tense.
In Britain, there are 70,000 jobs seekers in Slovakia.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students go to British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
It is indeed the island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be done if you choose correctly.
The golden horse and white beaches, high waves, or sea, relaxed as a fishermen.
Palma trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or marble cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean islands, you can find this in a full and even richer list.
However, you can find a lot more on a island, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
During the Spanishs, Cuba was the charm of their American conquerings.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that human eyes have ever seen.
Havanna became a treasure warehouse and a re-loader that the Spanish have been robbed in America and transported to Europe.
Then the American era came.
The Nacional Hotel was built at the end of the 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of American mafia, built it because everything that was found to be criminal in the United States (particularly styling), welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
They were among their guests, for example.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, tower houses were built, on the broadways of the 50th century Cult symbols of cars.
Ernest Hemingway purchased property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own jacht in Cojímar.
Bodeguita del Medio walls are decorated by the signatures of American show business stars and politicians.
And today?
The Havanna Bodeguita wall can also be provided with your handmark.
You are mixed with cocktails in the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel.
And the cars of the 50s Cult are travelling to Havana until today, because your sons exported once and your sons have been ruined in this salty and wet air long ago.
Although the oldest part of Havanna has been significantly destroyed, there is no such beautiful colonial monuments in the area elsewhere as there is.
Other places are becoming more beautiful than Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides so much money, its development has a green path.
In the last 15 years, new hotels were built not only in Havanna but also in Varader, on the coast of the Holguín Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique beauty in the world, which is mostly assessed by trainees.
From their expanded plantations, sugar cane was delivered to sugar plants by steam and motor trains.
Their motor parks have not been upgraded for decades, so there are machines that can be seen elsewhere in museums.
Where do we go?
Most of the most well-known places are not avoided by visitors to Cuba.
So you don't need to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Maybe we should just remind you that there is a museum in the Hemingways, and who loves the writer doesn't need to miss visiting this museum.
One of the most painted parts of the Viňales Valley Cuba in the western part of the island.
Boot vegetation grows from lime lining.
Mosquitoes, lime mountains and rocks are rigidly rising from the bottom of the valley and gathered in their sandy soils, resulting in which the fragmented skirts are covered by a dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where the best-quality Cuban tobacco may be produced.
With its final form, you can meet at a visit to one of the Havanna cigar factory plants.
Some may also find it interesting that Major Zeman's episode of Chile was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city was founded shortly after the Spanish island colonization.
The name and glory were brought by slave and sugar trade.
The economy spent a body in the beauty and monumentality of not too big city.
In four centuries, almost nothing has changed in colonial Spanish architecture with subsequent French settlers.
Trinidad, between Escambray’s plane and sea, was so misleading that even in the last century, there were no roads that would have linked this country to the rest of the country.
That particular isolation helped to stay outside.
Nothing was built there, so they didn't break down, everyone was happy that she had a roof over her head.
If a person has more than a afternoon on Trinida, it’s worth watching the interesting places in the area like the Playa Ancón Beach or the Valley of Sugaryards.
This evening, it's suitable to go to Casa de la Música, which after darkness comes to you, where music will only be quiet in the morning.
Baraco
Some of the towns in the east of Cuba are considered the most beautiful city.
This opinion must be influenced by the road itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo have to fight high and tagged mountains, which are driven by human activity in almost an affected nature.
The eastern land language of Cuba, thanks to the uninterested nature there, was recorded on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made here, in the church there is a cross of Columbus (whether it is made hundred years after the shipping of Columbus) and the hill where it was previously waiting and today the El Castillo hotel is located, some of the most famous tables of the El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Meastro planes, the Bay of the Diszno and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret of Tropicana, Caridad del Cobra’s Cuba Patron of Saints, Santeria, African religion, which can be written by the successors of former slaves.
As they say right, it's better to see it once.
Afghanistan's allies are passive, said by Americans
The lack of a few soldiers and necessary equipment also affects the course of the United States' Afghanistan mission.
Minister of Defence Robert Gates said NATO should design concrete plans for the next few years.
The Afghanistan mission is not expected to take place, the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh in Scotland, which have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to increasing resistance to the Taliban movement, eight participating countries will also consult on further plans and coordination of allies.
While the U.S. Minister of Defence Robert Gates has called NATO teams for greater activity this week, the UK considers the strengthening of the Afghanistan government and the strengthening of development assistance.
“Afghanistan’s development can be tangible, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The other population has the opportunity to launch further development of the economy and security itself,” the British Minister for Des Browne told BBC.
Nineven percent
According to the U.S. government data, the afghan rebels are the strongest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent compared to the last year and in the southern Helmand region by 60 per cent.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the south.
According to the United States, the allies also reached their borders in the organisation and equipment of the teams.
More helicopters, soldiers and experts were specifically requested to teach African troops.
“We need to think about the specific objectives of the future and the methods to achieve them,” řekl Gates.
He spoke to Jaap de Hoop, the Secretary-General of NATO today.
“I’m not happy about what is happening in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment that we need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told the Reuters news agency at the end of the three-day talk with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Out passive
In recent months, there are discussions between participating countries about whether all allies offer the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany was criticised, for example, because of its passiveness.
"The Germans are in a relatively large number of people in Afghanistan.
However, they were introduced in areas where violence and fighting requirements are not as high as in the southern and eastern part of the country,” Gates said.
This week, the British Sun called the German soldiers lusts.
"The Afghan solarists appeared: Germans play while our sons fight," Sun wrote in the material supplemented by the photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild attacked and published a picture of a British team in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt reaches a billion in 2009
Every Czech crown will receive 84,000 government debts.
At the end of September, the total debt reached the crown of 842.7 billion.
This year, the government plans to borrow 159,2 billion kroons.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan with a crown of 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of the public budget.
At the end of September, the Czech Republic’s debt has reached the crown of 842.7 billion.
Over the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroons.
However, it decreased from June with 13,4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has now confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
Each of the Czech Republic will receive more than 84,000 kroons.
Over the year, the state owed more than 11 billion crowns.
"To date, thanks to the lower deficit of the next year, we can only go beyond the one-billion crown limit in 2009.
The debt will move around 900 billion and a billion dollars in the next year,” said David Marek, Patria Finance analyst of the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, the analyst of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, says: “We can move through a billion in 2009.
It depends precisely when, for now, on the next budget unknown.
If it proves that the situation would change in the policy area, politicians would be willing to retreat more, it would also be possible until 2010.
But I don't assume this change," he said.
Increased debts
State debt is formed by central government debts, mainly by accumulating government deficits.
The state debt is financed with cash tickets, state loans, direct loans, or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has increased by 38.5 billion this year to 719.4 billion kroons.
The foreign debt of the state has increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroons.
By the end of September, the so-called state debt has reached the crown of 803,3 billion and decreased from June to 13,7 billion kroons.
The average amount of government debt has increased for 6.5 years.
"The debt between the entire year has increased by 13% in the first quarter, which is actually quite much compared to economic progress.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated in loan bonds, where the increase is 20%.
The wrong thing is that the debt increases, but on the other hand, it shows that it will be because it will be traded as soon as the pension reform will be here," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than waiting
The funding strategy and the management of state debt in 2007 show that this year the government has planned to borrow a loan of 159,2 billion kroons.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan with a crown of 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of the public budget.
This amount is mainly made up of the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion kroons this year instead of 91.3 billion kroons.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency has planned a maximum of 13,3 billion kroons, ten billion reserves for pensions, 43 billion kroons for state loans and 1,8 billion kroons for loans from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher appears today in front of a cartoon court because of a name given to a plissimacko
A cartel court sentenced the British teacher in Sudan for 15 days in prison and refusal from the country due to the violation of Islamic law.
The British woman was accused of having 6-7-year-old students to be called a pussy bear Mohamed. However, Islamic religion prohibits any representation of his prophet.
Such action can be punished by bruise.
The 54-year-old British woman, who is a coach of Unity High School, was arrested on Sunday. Based on paragraph 125 of the Sudanian Criminal Code, the Islam was accused of infringinging and rebelling after the parents of students complained against it several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked his 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's plüss mask.
“A total of eight names were recommended: Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed,” says Robert Boulos, director of the school.
Finally, 20 children from 23 voted for Mohamed's first name.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Prophet Islamic, but also a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a common log with the picture of the mask and the "My name is Mohamed".
The problem is that any representation of the prophet is a violation of Islamic.
Gillian Gibbons, a Muslim colleague in the same school, said that he knew him well, and that the teacher would never have done anything that would hurt any religious belief. He said it was just a "innocent mistake": "I'm sorry that he voted with the kids."
Many of the students of the teacher agree with this opinion. They think the teacher treats the children very well, and "sever talks about religion in class."
Remember that Mohamed is also the second most popular cross-name in Britain, and there are 14 different writing methods in English.
This is a crossname chosen by Muslim families so often as one of the ways of honoring the prophet. (Gyakran is given this name by the first-born child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the cross-name?
Can you get this name, for example, a game?
This is obviously a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the region at the last Vienna negotiations on Wednesday.
The result is failure.
Without the approach of the positions, the sixth and last discussion of the future status of the separatist region between the Serbian and the Kosovo Albanians ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
“It’s unfortunate that the parties did not agree on status,” Wolfgang Ischinger announced at a Vienna press conference.
The American Ambassador Frank Wisner underlined that in the region peace is at risk and urged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after negotiations.
“We don’t have to take violence in the near future, but there is a very difficult period,” he added, stressing the existence of “relevant tensions.”
On December 10, the mediation ends
On Monday, the intermediate trojka comprising the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo.
In 90%, the future of the Albanian Living Province can be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian intermediary Alekszandr Bocan-Harcsenko submits its report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The conference near Vienna, Baden, reported the sixth and last meeting of the negotiations since the United Nations relied on the Trojan last August.
The Americans and Europeans consider their mediation mission to be completed on 10 December.
The Russians who have already failed Kosovo's independence in the Security Council will continue negotiations after the expiry of the deadline.
"Russia was committed and remains a negotiating solution, with the compromise," said Bocan-Harcsenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
Once Kosovo was under the leadership of the United Nations for 8 years, the Western authorities believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina announced that he was willing to declare his independence unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide for him.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"We didn't get a deal," said the President of the independent region of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the badeni hotel where the last chance negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of Kosovo's uprising, and the future Prime Minister of the Province also expressed regret.
He added, however, that the idea of Belgrade's autonomy would be "continuation of the past to murders and deportations".
"Domino Effect"
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, believed that the compromise was still possible, and the majority of Albanians in Kosovo warned the consequences of unilateral declarations of independence.
Belgrade is still in an unstable region because of the wars of independence in the nineties.
"For Serbia, this does not rule out the possibility of compromise," Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision would only be to the Security Council, where the Russian ally had the right to betting.
"The final word will be for the Kosovo Parliament."
"For Serbia only the solution approved by the Security Council", the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“The negotiations were held for two years.
They must end at the same time where they started: in the Security Council."
Fatmir Sejdiu said to journalists that "the final word of the Kosovo Parliament" would be the one-sided declaration of independence by the Albanians on the basis of a "convention with the Western powers".
Bush has called for an agreement between Israel and Palestine
On Tuesday, President George Bush announced at the opening of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis in Maryland that Israel and Palestine finally agreed to sign a joint statement.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmúd Abbas agreed that they would immediately negotiate between their peoples for 60 years.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush promised to support them in all possible ways in order to sign the "peace treaty" in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must eliminate the "terrorism networks" and Israel should abandon colonial activities - Bush announced and recalled the two parties to their commitments in 2003 on their "restructure plan".
The Head of the White House underlined that the objective of negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel was to sign a peace treaty with which all the issues involved, including central issues, are resolved.
The latter concern the three delicate problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who have been removed from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who have lived in the territory of the state of Israel today.
Abbász, who spoke after the President of the United States, held a statement that future negotiations would be "global and deep-reasonable" and touch all areas of the regulation, such as "Jeruzalem, asylum, national borders, colonies, water and security".
Then Olmert promised that future negotiations would be "intermediate and continuous" and that he would try to "end up in 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush set out the feasibility of the vision of Palestine and Israel.
Saudi Arabia stated that Bush had promised this before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia (with its participation as a success in Washington) has initiated a plan to ensure peace by Israel by withdrawing from all Arab areas, including Eastern Jerusalem, which were occupied during the 1967 war.
Annapolis is an answer in the history of the Middle East, especially because of the root of the problem and focusing on central questions,” says the Prince of Saudi Arabia in his interview with the Arab daily newspaper of Saudi.
The prosecutor said the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As it is commonly used to be in such news, the official position and the speech contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first investigation initiated by the National Police Office (IGPN) on Sunday, a police car went to the Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel, a few minutes after 17 hours.
"The car was patroled, so it wasn't in action. It went 40-50 km/h without surfing," we learned from the police source.
The young two helmets without helmet were driven by a green, "not included in the official register, so it is not used on road market" (see below) with Kawasaki brand engine.
"When they didn't comply with the right hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car," says a policeman.
The result of the alcohol test on passengers of the vehicle was negative.
The strength of the impact is well shown that the front of the car was rolled in, and the windscreen star was cracked in shapes, and the pusher fell down.
Pontoise's prosecutor, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, said yesterday in an extraordinary report that IGPN and Val-D'Oise County National Security Directorate, were entrusted with the investigation that was initiated as a result of the failure to murder and assistance.
During the afternoon, the prosecutor said at a press conference that, at the current stage of IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police could be excluded.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses interviewed the accident on Sunday night confirmed "the report of the police that the robogo arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car."
On the last day, a trail, which undoubtedly was pulled by the legs on the road, was shown that the two vehicles were collapsed and traveled together for a while until the police car managed to control it.
Vehicles were booked for technical testing.
The two victims carried out a medical examination yesterday.
What happened directly after that?
Yesterday, as a runner fire, the talk spread in Villiers-le-Bel, that police were leaving the site quickly without helping the two young people.
In this regard, the IGPN expresses gently, but excludes the police from doing "what serious mistakes".
“This is the hardest part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and increased precautions,” we learned from the police source.
The Liberation met a witness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of your home is looking at the location.
"My cousin, a hospital nurse, went down to try to revive them," the witness said.
"We couldn't do anything anymore."
Then he noticed a policeman who was completely disturbed and distracted.
The other two tried to revive one young, and the fourth called."
The tension amongst the presenters was increasing, as the unwanted situation of the two young people became evident, so the incoming police moved their colleagues away from the site by car.
We also know from the eyewitness that the ambulance arrived at about 20 minutes after the police leave.
Heart massage was also used, but in vain.
“I wouldn’t say the police did not try to help young people.
Young people have been helped.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
They did everything to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Women's tension in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police prevented the first protests introduced by General Musarraf two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the eastern part of the country, in Lahore, about two thousand protesters against the measures introduced in the state of emergency have been wounded from the light gas bombs used by the police forces.
In response, they threw the police with stones, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar events occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and wounded the lawyers.
More people were produced.
In Islamabad, the registered lawyers of the Supreme Court called for general strikes and announced protests due to the arrest of about 500 opposition members, human rights warrior and lawyers on the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
There were several protests in Multan and in the northwest of Peshawar.
Since Monday the movement of lawyers is supported by the huge Agahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance that combines the religious parties. The leader urged the people to send flowers to those judges who do not agree with the emergency situation and the eyes of those who swore before Musarraf.
"The promise of Musarraf is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure notified on Saturday evening.
The Court shall declare in the coming days the legality of the re-election of President Musarraf on 6 October, with an indirect vote.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was moved from his office and was relocated.
“All we are witnesses, unlawful, unconstitutional and contradictory to the Supreme Court’s decisions,” the President said to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise to leave the army for the purpose of performing the civil presidential role was “lossing” after the introduction of the state of emergency, announced on Monday, Vice-President Tariq Azeem.
Musarraf was forced until 15 November, i.e. until the end of his first presidential mandate, from the military uniform.
The Vice-President of Information also confirmed the news of postponement of January elections.
The Pakistani government, by the way, disregarded the country-wide speaker that Ms. Musarraf would have appointed a deputy position for President Musarraf.
More than a third of pregnancy is not designed
This result includes unwanted (24%) or inadequate or unplanned pregnancy.
Even today, more than a third of pregnancy (36%) is not planned - the study of the French National Institute of Demographics (Ined) has been revealed forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act liberalizing contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or inadequate or unplanned pregnancy.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception such as tablets or cervix are still failing in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraceptives has made it more effective for "birth regulation". The study notes that only 5% of women between 20 and 44 years of age in 1970 have taken contraceptive tablets, but now that rate is 60%.
Today, eight of 10 pregnant women are designed.
Each fiveth couple of months of accuracy, and if possible, it will be spring, as this is the most favorable season for the child's reception.
A spectacular repair at the space station
Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work for more than seven hours in space to implement the spectacular improvement of the unprecedented solar panel for the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous space is a record in many respects: repair took a very long time, very little time to plan, and away from housing modules, spacecrafters had to do with "barkács" tools.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a huge cylinder-shaped element that will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see the framed section).
This module is a kind of transfer to laboratory modules.
However, we need to take care of their electricity supply.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to relocate one of the modules that generate electric power through the 17,5 tons of solar panels, which were already on the ISS.
Then the crew began opening the 76 metres wide solar panels of the module.
One of the harmonicly foldable boards infringed one of the cables in about one metre long.
In order to avoid further injury, the table has not been opened.
The task of spacecrafters was originally to make a check-in walk from the Discovery Space Rock, then to correct another malfunctioning solar panel. Instead, they had to devote their full time to improving the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to make the show hanging on the 30-metre robot arm of the space slope on the chart of the station.
He's one of the best "space walkers" of NASA.
He's a tall, strong, very good body, and he's got a long arm.
The 46-year-old, doctor-graduate man had to "operate" the "injured" solar panel.
After thoroughly assessing the damage generated, he cut the wrong cable, and some "bone" fixed the damaged area.
In his work, he also helped another "astronomer" who stayed near the safe gateway, and from inside the other astronauts, including the crew captain, Peggy Whitson.
The tool used by it is a mini hokibot that was seen by insulation against hundreds of voltages of solar panels, the astronauts of the station were five-folded and "barkácsed".
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his companions completely opened the board and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon, the astronauts held a half-day rest, and then they returned to the Discovery Space Rock on a week to start the planned return to the Wednesday.
Exchange rate of EADS shares
The exchange rate of EADS shares fell largely on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company producing aircraft and protective equipment announced that the delay in the development of A400M aircraft will result in an additional cost of € 1,2-1.4 billion.
The exchange rate of EADS shares is currently EUR 21.96 after 4% reduction.
The company was forced to review its 2007 operational performance forecasts, as the development of A400M engine is delayed, which is likely to result in the delay of the aircraft landing.
The delay in the transfer of aeroplane in combat, announced in October, will cost €1,2 to €1,4 billion, of which more than 1 billion affects Airbus," announced the European EADS Company's parent company.
Due to the emergence of these expenditure, the EADS should provide new plans for its operational result in the future Thursday 2007, when it announces its quarterly results, but it did not provide additional figures.
The Group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing a new cost assessment.
In 2006, the EADS operating result decreased by 86%, mostly from the late development of another program, A380 giant machine, which also has a high financial burden on the company.
The company originally designed to transfer A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
Stay in status quo
There are no big surprises for Sunday elections: the majority of Russians will vote for Putin's Head of State party, the Universe to Russia.
This is the need for stability of Russians, to say, self-control, appears after a strongly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Vladimir Putin, Russian Head of State, speaks in a television message to the voters, which has already been recorded, but its content is still confidential.
Putin leads the Kremlt support party, a list of candidates in the United Russia, which is expected to win a stunning victory in the elections.
During yesterday's reception of foreign ambassadors, the Head of State did not tell us anything: only another exploration against the interventions of the Western countries, which was the subject he liked during the campaign.
"We know what the price is for real democracy, so we want honestly, absolute transparent and open elections without any violation of the law," he said.
However, the opposition believes that this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign in which they believe that the voters have been pressured.
The leader of the Communist Party, Genmajj Zjuganov, says, “There was no such dirty choice in Russia even in Jelcin’s time.”
After the defeat of last weekend protests, the former Chess World Championship, Garri Kaszparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized protests, and his attorney said he would not be allowed to visit.
"Russians still think of "homo sovieticus"
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
- Who's following Putin in the Head of State?
The date of the first round of the presidential elections was published yesterday in the Official Journal, which will be March 2, 2008 and the candidates may indicate their intention of departure by December 23.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, its mandate cannot be extended.
There are no other successors on the sight price.
What role does Putin play in March?
Will you be the Prime Minister?
Or will he, as leaders of the Almighty Russian Party or the majority of Parliament, decide on the government and the President?
Whatever happens, the departing power wins both in Parliament and in the presidential elections.
It has now become a tradition.
"Russians are still thinking of the way "homo sovieticus": they don't feel to control their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
Niki oil Copenhagen, the historian of the University of Saint Petersburg, goes even further: theory shows that five hundred years later the country became a Christian, so the development of civil society is delayed, and the traditional community spirit has hindered the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, "Putyin has moved back to the paternalistic model, which was perfect for the people. It is also more like that, as this new kind of paternalism has been accompanied by fear, but with certain economic well-being," Maria Lipman, a co-worker of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, Russians “reject personal responsibility from their own minds”, which appeared quickly after the Soviet Union’s explosion.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all the layers of society, even the world of business.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the Single Russia are led by 65 governors, who are out of 85 leaders in the Russian region.
The freedom imported from the West is often chaos, as it happened in the 90s.
The public opinion favours stability.
In this spirit, the Russians are not voting for extreme parties.
54-year-old teacher Tamara Cserednyichenko said, "Why should we think about it?
Those in power are not so bad, why should we replace them?”
Imprinting memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive has become public, documenting 17 and a half million victims of the religious regime.
The 47 million archive document, which booked 27 kilometres of shelves in Bad Arolsen, located in Hessen Province, has so far been researchable only for "humanarian" purposes, i.e. only a unique and name-sighting option for home victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, the 11 States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archive for researchers and historians.
After each state ratified the Convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
Opening Bad Arolsen's documentary allows historians to do research on the "replacement of prisoners, the inhabitants of camps and the health status of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the publication of documents as they contain their names and thus confidential information.
Such could be the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
The purpose was to investigate the lists of concentration camps and the arrest orders issued by Gestapo after the war was to be collected for practical reasons. The goal was to investigate citizens deported or sentenced to forced work on these grounds and perhaps to provide evidence of their internship on the basis of which they could receive compensation.
More than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are currently dealing with the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, a part of the research community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of outstanding importance.
"These documents are basically nothing new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the University of Berlin in 2006.
The EU-India Free Trade Convention would be signed in 2008
The turnover of bilateral trade in India at annual level is now about EUR 60 billion.
The EU’s first trade partner in India and 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the Free Trade Convention in 2008 - Peter Mandelson announced European Commerce Commissioner Kamal Nath in India.
EU foreign ministers have already approved last April that the European Commission should open negotiations to sign free trade conventions with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual traffic of indo-European bilateral trade is now about EUR 60 billion.
The EU’s first trade partner in India and 18% of its external trade.
In addition, the EU is also the main foreign investor in India, but India is only the 9th most important trade partner in the EU, according to the figures of the European Commission.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade convention can be economical for both parties," and "india could increase its presence in a flourishing market with 450 million inhabitants."
The 10 most important products exported by India to the primary or secondary importers Europe added to the European Commissioner. The two giant, Europe and Asia every year replaced “47 billion euros” and “10 billion euros” by Danièle Smadja, the head of the European Commission’s delegation in New Delhi, at the same time saddened the fact that bilateral trade has not always achieved its full potential.” The EU and Indian President of the European Commission meets in Friday, New Delhi, in the eighth Diplomatic Summit, which participates in Manmohan Singh and José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Answer for concerns: Bank of England offers 10 billion pounds to the money market for five weeks
The Bank of England would like to alleviate the restoration of credit conglomerates, so it announced on Thursday that it was pumping 10 billion pounds on the money market, which would be available with 5.75% basic and normally five-week runs this time.
"We want to make it easier for banks to plan their liquidity positions at the end of the year. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank's reserves will be offered in the framework of a five-week open market operation on the international financial market," the bank's press release.
According to the Bank, 10 billion euros (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December, at 12:15 pm local time. The offer will be valid for the central bank's fund rate and the repayment deadline will be due on 10 January.
This is the first time that Bank of England will issue liquid funds for five weeks in the framework of an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually a week.
In the Bank of England press release, he added that "demand for further measures" to adapt interbank loans to the central bank's fund rate.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the level of September 18: it currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the Bank of England has charged a significant criminal interest on the amounts pumped to the money market, which has prevented banks from using them.
According to the speaker (which only strengthens the exchange rate of the font compared to the euro), many would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could have received more favourable interest rates and more discretion.
UMP and NC are not willing to examine the socialist proposal on customer power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre group closed off the discussion of the articles of the Socialist Act on Customer Power, which is equivalent to the rejection of the text itself.
The text, which was discussed at the meeting of the Socialists, included about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the Socialist Party, including 50% increase in the employment supplement, the restoration of variable fuel tax, the introduction of the travel check and the limitation of the rental fees.
Since the UMP and NC 180:115 voted against the examination of articles, the meeting of the government and the opposition at times in sharp voice changes ended in the end. This was only a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy’s talk on the shopping force.
The Head of the Socialist Delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group will submit all its proposals again in the context of the amendment of the draft financial law correcting, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A New Festival is Born
A number of speakers circulated on the New Philadelphia Music Festival, organised by the C3 Presents. But now, the event-organizing and popularising companies announced that in cooperation with the British producer company Melvin Benn, the Festival Republic, the Vineland Music Festival will be held in New Jersey.
“It’s a respect for us that we can work with a man who starts the American festival today,” Charlie Jones said to Billboard.com from C3.
C3 also organises the festival of Lollapalooza in Chicago and Austin City Limits.
Wineland in New Jersey will be held on a festival summer, so there will be a way to take a tent.
The festival will be held between 8 and 10 August at a private area of about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Festival Republic, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is Melvin Benn, one of the world’s biggest festival organizers.
In 1989, he started the British Reading Festival, which attracts about 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn further expanded his palet with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006, the Festival Republic invited the Latitude Festival to life at Henham Park in Suffolki.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been a co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival’s production, license and organisational tasks. This festival has now been able to take up to 177 500 people.
The C3 colleague, Charlie Jones, called the Glastonbury Festival "the most inspiring event" that he has ever participated in. He added that his company and Melvin Benn’s company work in parallel to enriching the region with a European-style festival plan.
"The Philadelphia site has already been selected before, and together with Fairmount Parks Committee, we worked hard to arrange this festival in the center of Philadelphia," Charlie Jones said.
“We had a discussion with the city, and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, because of the political forces of the city leadership, the organization failed," Charlie Jones continued.
“We were happy to talk to Melvin Benn about this, and now we are preparing to organize a huge festival at another unique site, which we ultimately serve the interests of Philadelphia’s inhabitants.”
In 2005, the C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival at the Grant Park in Chicago, after he proved his exceptional festival organizers at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross revenue of the two events was 9.8 million in 2007 and 11.3 million in 2007.
Both festivals were held at city locations.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas," Charlie Jones says.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way and to create both the European rural atmosphere and the common sense of urban life in America."
Vineland is located on a halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland's population, and even the mayor itself, is enthusiastic to support the event," Charlie Jones says.
Although you are not talking about the details of the agreement, it tells us that "the conditions are positive enough to allow you to invest in such a big event at a site that hopefully gives you home for a long time to the festival."
Charlie Jones says that the festival will be a “great” size, and its reception capacity is approximately 80 000 people in the Bonnaroo Music Festival of Tennesse.
The joints have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
“Vineland will be a rock festival, but we plan a variety of musical offers that everyone can find something in it for his sake,” Charlie Jones says.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, together, form the C3 company, which was awarded by the latest Billboard Touring Awardson, the best independent event organizer.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It is not easy to seduce Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight with the Terminator...
Seduction is one of the tasks sent to Montreal.
The mission is "politically difficult", as the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, opposes the translation of its own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight with the "Terminator Governor"?
“We need to be careful, because the film industry decides which is the best place for us.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our task is to offer the best possible conditions to be decided by us," says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for festivals
Denis Turcotte focuses most on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars began.
The aim is to introduce and promote as many québeci movies at all American film festivals, whether it is either the Sundance Film Festival or the Denveri, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The L'ëge des ténèbres film was welcomed a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, the Palm Springs International Festival will also be held.
The Shake Hands with the Devil film is presented in Santa Monica and in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
Québec also represented himself with four short films and four play movies this month at the American Film Institute Fest event.
Will the end of the year be a rally on the stock market? The opinion of experts is shared by the "subprime" crisis
Nearly five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their hands and looking forward to the end of the usual year.
This year, however, it is not clear for experts that this will actually happen.
According to Banif, "in a statistical point of view in December, the exchange usually behaves positively.
However, only statistical forecasts are not necessarily appropriate, and even in the current situation uncertainty is characterized by the market, at least in the short term.”
Experts do not prematurely support the withdrawal of the stock exchange year at the end of the year, although they say that “the stock exchange market maintains the presence of liquidity, this gives an opportunity to invest, as there are no alternatives to guaranteed, especially fixed yields that negatively affect the escape to quality securities, as long as in the short term”.
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will be characterized by a side-oriented, volatility-free movement, "especially because the impact of the Fed Chamber reduction is unknown for the time being, the price of raw oil is high and also threatens inflation tension."
Javier Barrio, the BPI’s sales responsibility in Spain, agrees with this, i.e. it would be risky to say that there will be rally.
According to the expert, "the situation is not pink."
The loss of Ibex is nearly 4 percent compared to the highest values registered on 8 November when the index was closed at 15.945,7.
Despite all of this, not all experts are so scratchy.
According to Intermoney’s analyst Juan Solana, Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16,000 points due to the reorganisation of wallets and the deposits to the usual pension fund at that time.
On the other hand, the expert adds that this year there is a certain change, as the Rally is going to be a week after the second week of December, the Constitution's Day.
The analyst considers volatility to affect market trends unlikely.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst of Inversis Banco, we are close to the technical level and “that’s why we can experience the recession of the stock exchange index, which may rise depending on the news coming from the USA, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis.”
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on securities targeting the new maximum quotas of Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that “the line is on big securities this year.”
The expert would put two large banks and some construction companies on the list, "when the electricity sector will be already very expensive."
Federico Olucha says from Inversis Banco that growth is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
Rally can also be positive for construction companies, of course if it is at all.
“ACS has been trying to get its positions back for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow this way,” says the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be the main player of the remainder of the year due to the increase in sales during the period of Christmas sale.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also work well, although in this area representation is not too high on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two times have occurred in December.
The real-year rally was observed in 2003 when the stock exchange markets emerged from the crisis caused by the collapse of technological bubbles.
This year, when Ibex corrected 35 28.17%, a 6.68% jump was registered in December.
Thus, it is still open that 2007 will be the fifth year afterwards (Ibex has shown an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally can occur.
Banco Popular Español opens an open account from 200 Monday to 12 hours on Saturday
Banco’s Popular Español decided to renew most of its accounts.
In total, it affects 200 accounts located in the most commercially relevant parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the Popular Max name and make a big change for the bank.
However, for the rest of the Spanish institutions, this is the first group to be opened on a regular basis until 20.30 p.m. and even on a Saturday from 10:00 p.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The second group, the BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated that he plans to open his accounts for extended openings, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, he is currently making an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of his accounts in exchange for a afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, as they will decide on this basis whether they will join the initiative to promote a more favourable opening of businesses.
This is the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
I want to target private individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses.
The bank would like to operate 200 accounts across Spain for 18 months, as it is not a new opening order, but an existing transformation.
To this end, the institution modernises its accounts in trade zones according to the needs of customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new type of thinking of the nature of the accounts, a more modern, colorful design.
Commercial banks are responsible, Angel Rivera points out that reorganization is not necessary for large investment, but for more employees, which represent eight or nine employees per account instead of the current six.
Accounts in which even retailers are established will also sell non-financial products.
Favorite Experience
The Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in its three Madrid accounts.
Angel Rivero said the experience was positive.
In the Madridi Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets, the choice was correct, and Rivero said the decision was correct.
Banco's Popular Español currently has 2.500 accounts.
More 60 works under the name Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, and also has a very favorable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
In the units mentioned by PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used where some accounts offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to create competition for our customers,” Rivero says.
Currently, Telefónica has reached agreement and will sell mobile phones using external staff.
Telecinco first doubles its rival, Antena 3 stock market value
"We did it."
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, the adviser of Telecinco, expressed its satisfaction in closing the market yesterday, when it turned out that his leading television taxi doubled the value of Antena 3.
One thing, however, has been indifferent: “It only hurts that this isn’t because we have risen more, but because we have fallen less,” he said.
He even stressed that we “we’ve fallen less on the weak market”.
Telecinco closed with 2.54 percent increase last night.
This increase puts its annual loss to 15.66 percent.
52% of the company is Mediaset, 13% is Vocento, so the stock exchange value is EUR 4.488.88 million.
Raválisa, Antena 3 lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has lost 40.5 percent since January, so it cost half yesterday, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other registered communication companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; Prisa (in the Cinco Días) is 2.518.53 million and Vocento is 1.779 million.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antena 3 can be found to be similar between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can do on the same market, what costs and how this will return in terms of views.
Last week, Telecinco announced that he would like to be the first TV channel over the gross 1 billion ad revenue this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, the adviser of Telecinco and Publiespaña.
If the reported fact is realised, compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 financial year, the TV channel would increase its revenue from advertising by 3.6% in the current financial year.
Antena’s net turnover increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (as a result, it reached 734.4 million), while the net sales of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
According to the analysts, one of the factors that triggered the volatility of Telecinco’s stock exchanges is the high payout that has been held so far: in 2006, the shareholders of the company led by the President Alejandro Echevarria.
Vasile said, although it would be too early to decide, this rate may change after buying 33% of Endemol, associated with the mediaset.
“We have guaranteed a minimum of 50%, although we have always shared much more.
I hope that this year our shareholders will be satisfied with us, as they have already benefited from the 33% of Endemol’s acquisition.”
According to analysts, the market is currently characterized by some decay.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its revenue estimates for Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
They say that this could mean that the estimated increase in sales in 2008 will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% and in 2009 from 5.5% to 5.1%.
According to the same company’s forecast, Antena 3’s profits are reduced by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 reviews
1.
Ibersecurities: it recommends buying both securities, especially due to the high lease and long-term sustainable potential of the dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is more favourable (purchasing) than Antena 3 (continuity)'s "multiful attraction" and the strengthening of business.
3.
JPMorganism: In both cases, it recommends subtraction due to "relevant risks" (extended market and less favourable economic climate).
The Congress approves the adoption of MiFID in force on 1 November
In parallel to the parliamentary session - which has ended today with a congress vote approving the amendments to the Senate - the government has initiated a social dialogue on legislation based on the law so that both of them can take place before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups have consistently highlighted the efforts made by representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements to develop the most favourable standardisation of investor protection and to regulate the activities of companies in order to effectively operate the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, allows the modernisation of the financial markets, while strengthening the protection of investors, broadens the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Markets Committee (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive enables financial advisory services to be established by companies specialised in this regard, but also by natural or legal persons, as well as by securities marketing companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, to create a new form of financial advisory companies (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the Act increases the number of systems suitable for the implementation of operations involving funds, thus adding to regulated secondary markets to multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems that compete with current stock market participants.
In addition, the Law obliges investment providers to market information on their aspects, risks and risk management methods of their business profiles, as well as the monitoring of CNMV should be facilitated, registering on all operations carried out.
The Congress's Economic Committee has introduced a number of amendments. It is of particular importance that the securitised debts are treated as a "complex" fund, namely because of the high risk for the investor. This is confirmed in relation to high-risk mortgage credits in the United States (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally define the scope of the activity of those with economic and business qualifications. All of this was 30 years after the Royal Regulation setting the professional functions of exclusive economists in 1977.
Senate suggested the creation of new actors in the financial sector, such as the intermediary agent working for another account, does not need CNMV permission and may at the same time market products or acquire customers.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator figure, which Eurostat takes into account to calculate the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for November.
Its disclosure is consistent with Eurostat and the European Central Bank’s strategy to provide data that can be compared to the data from the United States, both in terms of the time and nature of their creation.
The calculation method is the same as the calculation method for the calculation of the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modeling method differs from the assessment of information that is not available at the time of disclosure.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the pre-indicator number is merely indicative, so it may differ from the final data that will be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to show relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, one of the vice-presidents of the Government and the Minister for Economic Affairs, stated that the increase in Consumer Price Index to 4.1 % in November was only "adolescent", but at the same time indicated that the price index would be expected to show a "very high" value in the coming months.
In the Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "even though the number of indicators is not really positive", the rate of inflation in Spain within the monetary union remained more or less at the same level in recent years.
He added that the month of November was “thought less surprise” than the previous month when the government did not count on such a great growth.
The Minister of the Economics recognized the value of around 4% of the data published today.
Northern Rock wants $42 billion for Virgin in three years.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently only €12 billion ($16 billion 800 million) since he had to take urgent credit from the English National Bank in mid-September.
Then he still had a record deposit of more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually decreased over the past two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers, despite the fact that the government promised a hundred percent guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial, commercial name, Virgin Money. Virgin will have to gain about a quarter of the British banks’ revenues in the next three years to get the remaining 18 billion pounds and thus reach the 30 billion target.
Richard Branson’s group of highly respected businessman Richard Branson’s advertising campaigns in England has become known to spend about 50 million pounds each year (i.e. EUR 70 million) on advertising and marketing to achieve the target.
Northern Rock has raised the offer of the Virgin consortium this week than the most favorable to avoid the bankruptcy.
Mayor Totana was arrested for a suspected corruption case
The Police arrested the Mayor of Totana in the Murcia province this morning, as they suspect that they were involved in the urban corruption scandal this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the City Hall and the police chiefs of the town were arrested.
The former city member José Martínez Andreo took over the place of Popular Representative Juan Morales, who was the head of the corruption network, according to the official bodies asked by the SER radio channel.
The police are further investigating in the city's offices and the City Development Council and cannot be excluded that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' attorney was also under investigation as the main suspect of corruption scandal this week.
According to SER’s radio, Juan Morales’ lawyer was arrested when he was leaving Morales with his bag of documents on corruption.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the presumed reward that Morales received in exchange for signing a city development agreement with a Galician construction company on the overgrading of 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are under arrest.
Bono accepts the candidate of PSOE in Toledo and his President of Parliament if they win the elections.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, adopted the offer of Mr José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to lead the PSOE Toledo list to the next parliamentary elections and to fill Parliament's presidential officer if the socialists win the elections.
This was announced by PSOE's secretary, José Blanci at a press conference and Bono himself confirmed the party's federal centre today after the meeting with Zapatero.
The Governor justified his election to the former minister that "we have to count with the best" in politics, and Bono is among the best.
In addition, he added that "probably" Manchai will be the candidate for the Socialist Party to the President of Parliament if socialists win in the forthcoming elections.
Bono would take over the position of President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he would not intend to go to the next elections and give up his political career in scientific circles, and then fight against climate change.
The former minister acknowledged that the Governor has constantly ruined him to return to the political scene since he had abandoned active politics two years ago.
He added that, since the voters are aware of who will be the vice-president in the event of the victory of the socialists, the party would also have wanted to inform them of who would be the President of the Parliament.
If Bono really fills the post, he would like Parliament to "respect and not the color of insulting or yelling" and to compare more to the citizens' home.
“After this time, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where it cannot be quietly discussed, it has already occurred that the Prime Minister’s speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate.”
At the same time, he spoke to the current President Manuel Marín, his "good job", but he did not want to mention himself as president, so that his opponents do not regard himself as "reflective".
Campaign for Climate
Since the movement that promotes climate change is mercilessly persecuting both skeptic behaviors against their forecasts, both those who prefer political or social battles should be very strong.
He also needs to set up a political leader such as Prime Minister Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and declares that "we need to make a new agreement with our Earth".
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which its government’s activity or inactivity contributed to the fact that Spain is in the top place in the Union that the Kyoto Convention does not comply with it.
Who are responsible for failing to comply with the Convention, which sector is affected and why did the Government not seek to avoid it?
Moreover, it should also be clear to explain to Spain what measures they intend to take to prevent climate change.
What companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population must be changed, what individual and social energy savings should we expect and what economic consequences will this have?
Who must sacrifice and who must pay to save our Earth?
But we didn’t get and we won’t get an explanation for these questions.
That's because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has taken measures, actual measures are always unfavorable.
They are cost-effective, uncomfortable and cost-effective for both companies and the public.
Even the PSOE gas prices would have been so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly revoked.
That is, we need to save the Earth with nothing, mere propaganda texts, empty, actual consequences-free passwords.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new offices.
The agreement with the Earth, as the Governor says, who speaks so well in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, and even builds elections and hesitation.
I'm sorry.
Totana mayor and police officer were arrested for a suspected corruption case
The Police arrested the Mayor of Totana in the Province of Murca, José Martínez Andreot, local police chief, secretary of the City Hall, and a catering entrepreneur for crimes related to urban development, were informed by police sources today.
The mayor was arrested in his home and then transferred to the City Hall, currently residing with several police officers, many of whom are investigated by the City Development Council and the Municipal Authority responsible for the management of industrial establishments and residents.
The three arrests were preceded last Monday in Galícia, Madrid and Murcia for six persons in a case in which two hectares of agricultural land were classified as an area that could be integrated into, so that the Galician Nuaria company could be able to build 4000 apartments after they paid unlawfully to the leaders during their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not been arrested yet, but are under investigation according to the Court of Justice of Totana.
The first six arrested persons were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, former Mayor of Totana, Juan Morales, who today is also under investigation by the independent parliamentary representative of the People's Party.
The former wife, who owns a property agency registered in Totana, is also examined as well as the current friend of the former mayor who lives in Murcia's county center.
Nuaria Group director and owner Manuel N.A lawyer and entrepreneur were arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), along with the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company, Pablo José M.G., who also belongs to the Nuaria Group and has been deducted through it.
The investigation is carried out by a group of criminal offences committed at the municipal level by the Police Operational Unit, members of which were held on the outside of arrests, mainly in companies related to the arrests, which work in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Ponteveder, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, one person was arrested: one of the owners of the well-known poultry products company in the area who could play an intermediate role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park of the city of Totana, which would have built 5000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the currently 25,000 residents.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as the Autesa in Inomonuar, Vigo, the Conycase, specialized in direct marketing, the sale, promotion and installation of buildings in Coruna, Venezuela streets and the Catholic Ferdinánd Square.
Things That Fall

If they agree, we will mislead the Book of the Month and see if we can acquire some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already set up one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can figure something out.

This commentary was found in one of the largest newspapers in Finland: (within the edge of the world’s report on the level of cultivation of PISA), in Helsinki’s Sanomat, referring to what appeared at the same time on 18 November with the criticism of Blackburn’s book.
"Philosophical teachings were brought to the public after the tragedy of the Jokela high school.
He quoted the writings of Platón and Nietzsche in the posts of a student in front of a college.
The Educational Advisor Pekka Elo, responsible for teaching philosophy, demanded that teachers look critically at Platon’s teachings and then added that Nietzsche’s knowledge is not necessarily important for the compulsory basic philosophy of high schools.”

One of his colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code contains an offence about online downloads:
A. Downloading a song is a crime and can be punished from six months to one year.
However, if you steal a plate of less than 400 euros in a store, it is just an infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal 1000 euros in a store, theft is already a mistake, but the punishment still does not reach the level of punishment to be imposed in the case of online download (Article 234 of the RTD).
C. If you steal a car, but take it back in 40 hours, the punishment still does not reach the level of punishment applicable in the case of online download (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect a lesser punishment if you are involved in a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you participate in a mass fight, you can receive a three-month penalty for a year (BTK Article 154), while the CD record is copied from six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the TSI).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. Marketing of copyright-protected films without the consent of authors is more punishable than selling pornographic materials to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague's right, someone's really slipped out of his hand.

My doctor gave me an article on strange research: "The money causes brain activity, especially if others have less of it."
In other words, the feelings of the workers depend on how much others have received on the day of payment.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonni, measuring magnetic resonances tomographs, and the results were published in the last number of Sciences.
The author of the study and the German Life&Brain Institute of Neurokognition group, Bernd Weber, said: “We measured the strongest activity when the participants responded correctly, and the partner failed.”
Researchers found that if both responded correctly and received the same cash rewards, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received double amounts, activity has increased.
I have no idea why such a great science was needed for such a simple conclusion.
General Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been persecuting the Balkan war criminals for eight years from the Prosecutor's office in Haga, and the Crime Tribunal in the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate will end at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with a bit bitter mouthfast, as the responsibilities of Srebrenician bleeding, during which 8000 Bosnian Muslims were slaughtered, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and Serbian Bosnian leader Radován Karadzsics are still free.
Their name is on the list of director Marcel Schüpbach, who has been named in his documentary: Carla's list (in 2006, Spain). Like the real crime, the film follows the work of the Swiss attorney General from Belgrade to New York, as attempts to pressure the relevant governments to press around the refugees.
What insurance corresponds to me?
Vehicle insurance, which represents safety for the owner of the car to bring significant damages and depends on several factors such as age, gender, the date of obtaining the licence, the type of family condition, the type of car to be provided and the nature of use.
Buying a car is only the first step.
Choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding which car we want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance company.
This agreement has a body in the form of an insurance contract which states that the insurance company shall take the compensation on the basis of the fixed insurance fee in the event of the damage.
The insurance fee is virtually the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account different factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining the licence, family status, type of car to be provided, use and other.
Insurance undertakings shall determine the insurance fee on the basis of statistics, i.e. a higher amount of the person representing a higher risk of accidents.
This is why women older than 25 years of age or less pay because statistics show that they represent a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, according to the statements, insurance companies concluded that married people also cause less accidents than lonely people.
In the type of use of the car, the frequency is the final.
The possibility of an accident increases more often than it is used.
In determining the insurance fee, insurance companies take into account a number of factors.
Therefore, the owner should carefully look into the best form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we present the most important factors in the election, so that the price that is best adapted to your guaranteed needs can be developed and acceptable.
At the time of the conclusion of the insurance contract, under 25 years of age, people must calculate a number of disadvantages such as the lack of driving experience and the update of the licence.
Although it is most ideal if we are guaranteed against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
The more precautionary leaders can commit complete insurance by self-intensively, thereby guaranteed against all dangers, and the price will be affordable.
In such a type of contract, the insured shall pay part of the damage.
"The amount of self-payment to be paid by the insured depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the self-party," says Luis Noguera, head of the first Europe of the Internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is the increased liability insurance for third parties when the customer provides itself against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage caused by his own car.
In addition, it will be secured against stealing, firefighting and losing the car.
It's a good advice.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents, as possible, because it has an effect on the bonus and thus you can reduce the amounts to be paid in the future.
A bonus is referred to as the benefits granted in relation to the basic tariff of the insurance company.
In comparison to the basic tariff, the punishment has been called malus.
"The bonus and malus depends on the company and its profits.
If the company has been a good year, you can afford to increase the bonus rate,” explains Nogue.
Once the 25-year-old limit has already been exceeded, it is easier for owners to provide adequate insurance as the risk of accidents is reduced due to experience gained over the years.
Then we advise you to make a full insurance.
“In general, young people are not able to apply their experience properly during an accident and even when they are running,” says the Spanish director of the European Insurance Company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the leaders have already crossed the fears of the beginners.
If the insured is already married, but there are no children, it is best to make full insurance, of course, if your financial opportunities allow it.
Insurance companies hold children’s couples to customers with the lowest risk, so in their case the payable fee is also lower.
In this case, the best of complete insurance is by self-determination (which can reach EUR 300), or if you have a higher bonus, the insurance can also be extended from the third year of the vehicle to the damage caused to others.
“They drive more calmly, while their customer power is greater and they allow themselves to be higher than their own part,” Luis Noguea strengthens.
In the case of pensioners, the full insurance is offered by self-restriction (which is around 150 euros) or can also be extended to liability insurance in case of higher bonuses.
Vehicle insurance is very important, not only because it represents protection to the owner in the event of damages, but also because it represents a large cost, so it is essential to choose the personalised form of insurance properly.
Celtic wants to get a point in Milan to get into the eight-decision.
Milan and Celtic will measure their power on Tuesday in San Siro Stadium to get the missing point when the League of Champions closes. The Italians may be first to this, and Scots can qualify themselves.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and already in the fifth round, they have guaranteed progress with a non-financial portuguese, while Celtic has nine points, but one more needs to be the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight the four-point Benfice.
Two games of the D group will be held a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan has to play at the Club World Championship in Japan, where on 13th, he will try to fight for progress in the predecision to the 16th final.
This group D will end sooner than the rest, and although the most likely result in Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be unfinished, the two teams will try to win, as the Italians do not want to stay at home, and Celtic can start from a better place in the eight-decision.
Even the defeat of Gordon Strachan's team is enough to qualify itself if Shakhtar won, but it can't be certain, because if there's an equality, the Ukrainians will get further, who lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but won the next battle (2-0).
The Italians will try to detract the night of Scots who want to go into the eight-decision of the Reorganized Championships League of Leagues twice after they were taken out of the last year with a goal from Kaka in the prolongation of 0-0 indefinitely followed by the prolongation (1-0).
The win of the "Rossonerik" Shakhtar would be most pleased, because if the Celtic goes into the eight-decision and stays in the UEFA.
Since Benfica, even though he is currently in the last place and is unable to stay in the European Championship, he can still get the third place with a victory in the UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to participate in the first concert of Spice Girls tour.
Spice Girls in Vancouver (Kanada) began their tour, and they were first in front of 20,000 viewers since they split up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were reported a few minutes before the concert organized in Vancouveri GM Place.
About 20,000 people exchanged tickets to be at the concert, where they also presented a video film about the history of the great success of the 1990s.
At the same time, with the reconciliation of the joint and the tour, the EMI was placed on the market in Spain, with two new songs “Headlines” and “Voodoo”.
Five Spice Girls members from the husband of "Posh Spice", British football player David Beckham's bracelet.
The athlete was also in the sightseeing area of GM Place, although Victoria banned him a few days earlier.
At the time of the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "he didn't see our performing clothes, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think about the show."
"Sporty Spice", there was a reason that the joint split up two years after leaving the band in 1998 'cause the members did not understand each other'. He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings for Spice Girls changed.
I thought why not? Now I'm glad that I decided so," Chisholm said about the band that he split up nine years earlier.
The singer added that in time things were arranged and we love each other.
But many things have changed since Spice Girls last played in 1998.
According to the CTV television, the band came to Vancouver at Virgin Airlines.
At the airport, a team of baby-sitters waited for them.
They have a total of seven children.
After the Vancouveri concert, the team will perform in California (USA), then in San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will act in Madrid on 23 December.
Another fear of Russian-Ukraine gas debate
The gas price has been renewed between Ukraine and Russia, which may also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is carried out through Ukraine and the disputes between the two nations are always a big focus.
Kiev stated that if Moscow raises the price of gas to be paid by Ukrainians, they will also suffer from higher transit costs for Russia.
As a result of a previous debate between the two countries last year, the supply to EU countries decreased.
The recent debate between Kiev and Moscow is the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly, the Gazprom's agreement attempt to pay the price of gas to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that a 50% increase should be made in relation to the gas produced from the neighbouring Turkmenistan compared to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of the shipment from Gazprom for Ukraine.
“It is important to argue in accordance with one of the most important gas suppliers’ transit states during the negotiations,” said Anatolij Kinah Ukrainian Minister of Economic Affairs at Reuters’ news agency.
"The changes to gas prices should be linked to our debate on the cost of transit in Ukraine (and in Western Europe)."
As a result of the recent significant gas pricing between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas team in Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a dominant decrease in exports to Western Europe, which also greatly pushed prices.
A quarter of the EU's gas supply is made by Russian gas.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but most of them are undiscovered.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet countries in Central Asia.
The NHS "need to check foreign workers"
The Committees of the Scottish NHS should improve the control of the criminal records of workers outside Europe - a supervisory body has said.
The proposal consisted of Robert Black’s main counter after a foreign-citizen doctor in Scotland was linked to the attack against Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern about the fact that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of overseas employees.
At the same time, through the five models of health authorities, its report also pointed out key controls that have been properly carried out.
After the Glasgow airport attack, the main counter checked the list of employees recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old doctor of the Royal Alexandra Hospital, located in Paisley, Bilal Abdullah, was arrested at the airport after a jipe led to the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were interviewed by the Old Bailey court in October by accusing automobile bombing attempts in the UK.
The NHS committees should check their workforce from overseas countries before starting employment with the availability of the skills and experience of the workers concerned and the provision of permits for employment in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Committees apply Disclosure Scotland in order to verify the criminal record, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the UK.
The report of the main counter, among other things, has proposed committees to introduce the Code of Criminal Registry guide, which facilitates the control processes of the employer with different overseas countries.
"Although we have found evidence of such inspections among the records of staff, they are not regularly carried out," says the report.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS meets its own pre-employment examination procedure at a high level, adding: "Our report highlights the areas to be developed in order to provide up-to-date information on the number of staff from the NHS overseas."
Dr. Peter Terry, President of the BMA Scotland, said that it is “normally unreasonable” that we can identify potential NHS employees with pre-employment controls in the future.
"The report says that pre-employment controls currently applied work well in the NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals has not yet been transparent," he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of overseas workers in the majority of their doctors and nurses is 1161.
However, the main counter pointed out that the numbers are likely to be higher, which is partly explained by the fact that it is a problem for committees to identify unfinished workers.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran region, Grampin, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are largely coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, employment permits and documents supporting professional qualifications.
The Scottish government is currently examining the directive and guidelines on the control of employees from the NHS overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgeon’s health secretary said, “I was delighted to carry out this task after the Glasgow airport was attacked.
In addition, the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committee, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the updated guide on employment prevention checks for the full staff, including those from overseas, reflects the best practical application. The updated version is planned to be published in the next month.
Joy Division is on the film award
Joy Division’s sometimes singer, Ian Curtis’ biopic, "Control", made five awards at the British independent Film Awards, including the best film award.
He also received a prize from the main character, Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis was formed, as well as director Anton Corbijn and co-operator Toby Kebbell.
The best actress was won by Dame Judi Dench with the Thriller, the “Details of a scandal”.
The Variety Prize - to set the British film into an international reflector light - was taken by Daniel Craig, who made Bond.
The fees were divided into the London Roundhouse celebration.
The film "Control" shows Curtis' rise in the hearts of Joy Division until 1980, when she committed suicide at the age of 23.
The "The Killers", David Bowie, and the "New Order on the soundtrack" film was made by only 3 million pounds.
The Dutch photographer, Corbijn, who has previously become known by the preparation of the U2 "Joshua Tree" album cover, was rich with two awards; with the best director and best starter director.
Another winner of the celebration placed rock music at the center; Julien Temple Joe Strummer, the Clash singer, took the best documentary award.
The best actor became Viggo Mortensen's award for making the driver of David Cronenberg's "Gyilkos" mafia boss in London.
Ray Winstone was famous for his role in the British film industry and received Richard Harris' award.
The fifty-year-old actress, whose name is included in the film "Scum", "Ehkoppon" and "Szex-dog", is currently engaged in the film "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Copenhagen".
Winstone is proud to take over the "Camelo" and "Harry Potter" award named Harris in 2002.
"For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened a gate," Winstone added.
“I feel really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, he was a great actress of his age, and I appreciate him very much."
The group consists of film directors, actors and festival organizers to select independent film prizes known as Bifa.
The supporters and patrons of Bifa include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
In Saudi Arabia, 208 people were arrested for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 terrorist cells were arrested, designed to carry out an attack against an oil facility, as well as several attacks on churches and security forces.
According to the world’s largest oil exporter’s state television, one of the cells wanted to smuggle rockets.
The supporters of Al-Qaida have launched a battle against monarchy, which has been operating as an ally of the United States since the 2003 Iraqi invasion.
According to the Television Report, an eight-person cell led by a foreign citizen to launch an attack against an oil facility in the Eastern province.
After an attack attempt organised by Al-Qaida against the world’s largest oil processing equipment in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia started building a rapidly reactive force of 35,000 people to protect the facilities.
According to the report of the Minister of Interior, 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell leading to an illegally crossing of the national borders, a person specialized in armed attacks.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight shots in the territory of the kingdom.
22 of these arrested were designed to commit attacks against church leaders and security forces.
The government called for a harder action by the Church leaders to fight against the Al-Qaida fighters who are in Iraq, who fight against allied forces and the U.S.-supported Silver Muslim government. The latter is considered to be a heretic of Saudi hardliness.
The Al-Qaida fighters are considered to be a major part of Saudi Arabia’s church leaders, who have been involved by the authorities in the support of the royal family’s policy.
The fighters of the organization - inspiring Al-Qaida's birth leader, Osama bin Laden, to target the Western Saudi Government - were aimed at attacking foreign residents, government buildings and energy facilities.
"The security forces have made huge efforts in the last five months," an interior minister said to the state television.
During the arrests, Medina also captured a 16-person media cell, designed to spread the "taxial thinking". Taxi thinking is the ideology of the muslim radicals of the nunnite, which supports the violent action against unfaithful and deceived Muslims.
There were also 32 persons accused of financial support for militants.
The Venus climate can give you a look at the future of the Earth
According to the researchers yesterday, Venus once provided pleasant living conditions.
The data of a European circulating spaceship suggest that this planet is much more considered to be the twin brother on Earth than we thought before.
Venus is the closest planetary talk on Earth.
In view of the size of the two planets, they are almost the same and their circular path, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
According to scientists today, billions of years ago, Venuszon could have ruled very similar living conditions to the Earth and could even have provided residential relations.
However, due to the exploration of high carbon dioxide glass house effects, the atmospheric erosion caused by sun radiation and the lower round speed of the planet, Venus became a different development path.
Today, the water has dehydrated from the planet, the surface temperature is hot enough to dilute the lead, and hurricane winds and lightning storms are destroyed.
The findings of the European Space Agency Venus Express Space Zone, based on the study of the planet for one year, illustrate how similar catastrophic climate changes can develop on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus Express missions, said: “Take a look at why the climate of Venus is so much different from the planet experienced, despite the fact that the two planets have a similar structure.
With our new data, it was possible to develop a scenario of the development of Venezuelan billions of years ago, when it could even have been inhabitable conditions similar to Earth.
The Police booked uranium
A kilo of radioactive material - a uranium enriched according to reports - was booked yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesman, three people were arrested and the subject was also examined.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was about enriched uranium, but said that the material could have been sold for a million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Open gates
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy for a candidate in a presidential election to answer questions from a snowman.
However, the Republican candidates of the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube, in which their questions were recorded and transmitted to the candidates on a video by ordinary voters.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday, November 28, was as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate on the other party on YouTube.
However, questions and answers this time reflected the situation of the Republican Party coming to the next year's election.
To date, it is not known that CNN producer leaders who co-financed the debate have selected YouTube clips to the candidates.
The longest question of the first half hour of the debate was the question of immigration.
This topic is one of the Republicans' kidneys.
CNN called on some unsure voters to call for a number: the intermediary experienced high agreement when the candidates spoke hard on the question of borders.
The most vibrant and longest debate was held between Rudy Giuliani at national level and Romney in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image of him that he has handled the issue of illegal immigration too easily during the Mayor of New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants from the former governor of massachusetts to build his house.
The vocabulary between them became particularly intense when the questioners were interested in supporting "amnesty" (which would provide illegal immigrants with a permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as the Californias of Duncan Hunter and Tom Tancredo, managed to deepen the subject.
Even though none of them are considered probable in the marking, their stay on the raceway may be explained by the fact that the bells of immigration began to be reached before and louder than others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is a broad agreement between the candidates: the common objective is to strengthen borders and tough action against illegal immigrants.
This topic - as well as fear of Chinese poisonous games and other worrying factors from the outside world - promotes the fall of the Republicans in order to forget or minimize the division between Libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when topics of different kinds were raised, the debate was very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he previously supported the weapons control.
John McCain and Romney debated on whether simulated water was considered torture.
Another questioner was wondering if the candidates believe all the words of the Bible.
In this matter, Giuliani finally struggled at the point of view that even though he viewed the Bible as his favorite book, the story of Jonas and the whale might not be literally interpreted.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
This is what Mike Huckabee, the first place of the Iowa election, has just been given his victory for a permanent Christian conservativeism, responded to the expectations that the death penalty was painful, but it is necessary.
When he was asked whether Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed as much as Jesus would be wiser than to go to the elections.
The competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee's intensive revelation in iowa coincided with the libertarian Ron Paul's money collector action and the enthusiastic excitement in Wednesday's debate.
The sudden occurrence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that two wings of the party have not yet been able to launch a common candidate among the more well-known and traditional aspirans.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party with a timely and convincing winning message for America's size and who found the party with both wings.
But now he shared the party, and the consequences are still incomprehensible.
Municipal pains
Another gap before Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, it doesn’t seem too stagnant.
No one gave up his honour, no politicians had been brought up their hotel bills in Paris, no one committed a non-marital scandal.
However, the discovery that a rich businessman under the name of others for more than four years had contributed to the Labour Party of Great Britain with over $650 000 (1.3 million), and that the party did not report, one of the things without which the surrounded Gordon Brown would have been well.
Two months ago, when the prime minister escaped the election, and when he stated that public opinion research did not influence the outcome of the decision, the British’s intellectual capacity was questioned unprecedented, people still hoped that Brown would provide a strong and effective governance.
However, as Vince Cable said, the leader of the Liberal Democrats with more and more spiritic comments, the former feared Brown Stalin became Mr. Bean.
The failure to save a bank called Northern Rock has put regulatory weaknesses and deficiencies in judgment.
The patient proposals to change the tax law have encouraged business stakeholders to work together with the government.
The loss of 25 million people’s personal data by tax authority has unprecedented a high level of administrative inconvenience.
In the House of Lords, three peaceful generals protested against reducing the budget of the army, saying that the position of the Minister of Defense is part-time occupation.
And now here are David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, the secretary-general of the Labour Party (formerly administrative leader), has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way out.
At the same time, governments can reach the point after which governance is impossible.
People don’t like politicians and don’t trust them, but when a new group is powered, they usually suspend their infidelity.
As it becomes clear, however, that the Prime Minister is highly unlikely to be able to take things first and perhaps not stay in the post for a long time, the suspended infidelity ends: the public officials' arm begins to leak, the office ministers will be instruction, and the press will look after bad news; and the government will begin to focus on defense and unable to focus.
In a certain sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult position, since, unlike other political leaders, he does not count as "fresh blood".
As much as you want to deny your relationship with Tony Blair, he had his right hand.
The problems around Northern Rock and tax authorities are linked to decisions made during Brown’s Minister for Finance.
And although the long-term investigation of the relationship between Blair's left-handed steps, such as the "fashion for money" case and political party funding, did not directly participate, voters may have the right to assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
The attacks committed are not as frightening as they are indicated by the cakes.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly.
Compensation can be the creation of the directions always promised by Stalin, who lives in Brown: reliable, solid and slightly hard-handed governance.
For example, it is a good thing to do about political donation.
The garbo-sensitive Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity, said that he did not want to reveal his charity to the public.
Maybe so, but the decision was not in his power.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of major political supporters is clear and clear: the public has the right to know who knocks on the gate of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew of the action of Abrahams, was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be excitement during the interviews; such as Jon Medleson, the Foundation Manager of the Work Party, who was informed of the disruptive donations in October.
However, to Brown, for the time being, there are no threads: nothing suggests that he knew about these rolls, not even that the payment of huge amounts was made after the office of Brown in June.
To date, the Prime Minister has completed half of his duties.
However, the violation committed by his party was soon condemned by the firmness of him; in order to investigate the case, he was commissioned by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, the lesson to learn is not too complicated.
In case of breach, the police are competent.
In addition, Brown must take care of other things, such as the appointment of the chairman of the independent committee on administrative rules that have not been chaired for six months or the effective reform of political party funding.
This would require co-operation with Turks and the break-up of special financial relations with the associations - this would be a hard wall for the couple of Brown.
But you should face some issues related to the party.
According to the surveys, the conservatives currently have a major advantage; Brown has had two years to take the voters back behind himself; the only way to make the winning is impeccable integrity and strong competencies.
Card sharks
Is the second-market mortgage market crisis threatening America's credit card market?
If blood comes into the water, it is natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the American housing market is weakening, predators focus on the country's credit card market.
The analysts of Goldman Sachs believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of public loans, the loss of the credit card market can reach $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
An increase in the rate of description of both the proportion of uninflated loans and the rate of failure to pay late payments over 30 days.
HSBC reported $1.4 billion losses in the US consumer financing segment last month, partly due to the financial weakness of card holders.
At the same time, panic is early.
The proportion of descriptions and late payments remains low.
Moody's credit rating agency has a 3.89% late payment rate lower than the historical average for the third quarter.
The reduction of rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
The changes in the US rules of individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency publishers, while at the same time causing large losses on the market of credit cards; the increase in the number of bankruptcy requests (and thus the ratio of description) is expected, irrespective of whether or not the total conditions of borrowing are deteriorated.
The rate of payment, which shows the proportion of consumer monthly lending, is also solid on the market.
In addition, trust in securities covered by a credit card is quite strong, despite paralysis in other areas of structured funding.
Dennis Moroney estimates that the volume of emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage market crisis are clear on the credit card market: consumers increase debt on credit cards to repay housing loans.
At the same time, card issuers mainly monitor cash movement and not the asset value, so the fall in housing prices does not necessarily lead to a change in creditworthiness of creditors.
The situation that has developed may be beneficial for creditors.
If the property is less than the value of mortgage loans, the incentive for consumers to redeem credit; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards is progressing in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt faster and more flexiblely to changing conditions than mortgage creditors.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of sudden re-flow of assets.
“We’re not likely to wake up one day to fully revaluate the loans,” says Gary Perlin, the Financial Director of Capital One.
If a surgeon crisis of subprime is less likely on the credit card market, the risk of gradual recession is much more likely.
If the decreasing housing market prices and the redemption of lending leads to a recession of America, the industry faces a huge future without any doubt.
It is worth watching those predators.
British bankers have confessed themselves guilty of Enron's case
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who were brought to the court to investigate their role in fraud in the name of Enron’s former financial director Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially declared themselves innocent in the accusation of a weekly fraud, allegedly co-operating Fastow in a secret fraud committed in 2000 with which their employer wanted to be rich.
Their negotiation began in January.
However, in a court hearing, the U.S. District Judge, Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them acknowledged his contemporary guilt.
The three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Greenwich NatWest have become known during the two-year release process in Great Britain.
After the 2001 collapse of Enron, the investigation in the United States is still waiting for you.
In 2002, the first accusation warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of the government investigation launched to explore Enron's bankruptcy.
Three brokers crossed the NatWest Triple, according to the accusation against them, traveled to Houston in 2000 to prepare fraud together with Michael Kopper, Fastow and Fastow’s right hand at that time.
Fastow, responsible for the planning of numerous fraud, who brought Enron into bankruptcy, held under control the Enron subsidiaries in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of its participation in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew that the interest was very large.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank’s share of $1 million in the subsidiary.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper in order to acquire shares in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow was falsely informing Enron that the energy company purchases a subsidiary of $20 million from Greenwich NatWest.
In fact, $20 million was hit by British bankers, Fastow and others.
The prosecution considers the bankers to be 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed his dual guilt due to his role in the collapse of Enron.
The United Kingdom was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently punishing six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Copper spends three years and a month's punishment in a Texas prison.
The three English men were able to travel to the United States with $1 million deposits per head, where they stay during the trial.
Enron, the seventh largest American company, reported a bankruptcy in December 2001 after the accounting tricks used for years could not cover millions of debt accumulated and reported as profitable but actually losses.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs have disappeared, market value is more than $60 billion and pension funds have decreased by over $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, founder of Enron, and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling was sentenced last year for their share of crime in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling currently spends more than 24 years of prison.
The conspiracy, fraud and other accusations imposed on Lay were terminated by the death of the man last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow
A Gulfstream G550 aircraft with a Rolls-Royce engine starts at $54 million without interrupting the journey between Moscow and Los Angeles with a tank.
However, this amount only counts as small money for some Russian rich people.
"18 passengers fit in it," said Dan Firer, Gulfstream's representative.
“No one orders so many seats because the machines are purchased for private families or corporate managers.”
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the 4-day, exclusive, Milliomos Vásár, organized in the huge exhibition halls around the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury items were rented in the exhibition, hopes that Russian new farmers are interested in all, from the magoon yachts covered with diamonds to 50 cents of fridges.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
"He's a good car, but he's not going after our products," he said.
"After the United States, private aircraft have the largest market in Russia."
It seems that the Russian capital swims in money like Dallas did it in the age of light, during the oil price explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when he went to some American millionaire Europe, and these Americans were considered materialists here," said Marshall Goldman, the senior scholarship of the Davis Center of the Harvard University of Russian and European Studies.
In the 1970s, like the Japanese gambling players in Saudi Arabia and the 1990s, Russians have now become the most spectacular poets in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands demand their share of the golden cup.
At another conference organised by the luxury industry, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, shared its opinion on how to sell high-value products in similar markets to Russia.
(The conference was organised by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes’ list of richest people, 53 billion people live in Russia who have a total of $282 billion.
In addition, the number of Russian millionaires in the second class reaches 103,000, who can have a total of $670 billion, established a study conducted by the economists of the Economic and Financial Research Centre, which analyses personal welfare development in the former Soviet Union.
(The World Bank’s data suggested that in 2005 the number of people below the minimum of existence was 15.8% in Russia.)
"There are hundreds of millions of people living in Moscow, and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris's jewelry store in London.
Nicole participated in the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"Every woman is unsuitable, and men represent a real treasure mine."
Two property market agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both themselves and their customers were considered millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, a young man, who's incredibly rushed in his unique design dress as if he's already used to this drive.
The purchase was primarily arranged for new farmers, for brand-oriented Russian customers who are willing to visit a wireless, cifra decorated site after several hours on the market, where you can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pockets, short-pick ice cream, standard billiard tables, double apartments, and Gund plüss masks.
For average people, the entry ticket cost 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who, in patriots, took place on the Dutch porcelain manufacturer's stand in front of Royal Delft, against a wall size, decorated with a blue-coloured rembrandt imitation.
"Russians are more interested in outstanding things."
In fact, the salesmen here said that long-term (based on the Russian Stenders, this means 10-15 years) rich Russians have already been struggling over the outsourcing logos to brands made in a limited number of brands that would not be able to enter a trade fair.
However, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires, and millionaires, spent the space every day.
Some of them were bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of the King Koil beds company, sold two mattresses made of silk, kashmir and cotton, worth 70 thousand dollars each day.
Also, on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, A1 Moto’s sales worker on the supply of high-quality cars with modern alarms, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Andrei Karapetian, luxurious car manufacturer, L.A. Connection, who has sold three refrigerators to Rolls-Royce Phantom on Sunday afternoon. The barrels are compared to connected chain bracelets and cost $55,000 each.
Reporters also showed a wheel for the Russian casino owner, which he said was involved with Swarovski crystals to create a roulette wheel.
The price of a set consisting of four pieces: $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants a picture of his wife's face from a circonium risk will not necessarily use these objects."
"He's going to keep them in the garage of 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of Russian customers are rich, Karapetian says the term "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege today, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
“Whoever bought property in Moscow four or five years ago is most likely a millionaire today if not in money, but at least on paper.”
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least make the appearance of wealth in front of the Russian property management company Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style phone covers that were accumulated with millions of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, CEO of the company marketing, said his team printed 500 thousand false banknotes to the Milliomos Buy.
Many visitors stopped playing with the money. Many people made photos of themselves on a mobile phone as they hang up in the money bucket or just put a few million on a pocket.
“See, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaires,” Karryev said.
Surgical surgery is suspected of a death in New Jersey.
On the day before Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked at the window of a "Slightly Healthier" restaurant and saw the ambulance stopping Cape Cod on two doors down the West Scott Avenue.
A police car arrived shortly later.
Then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop," said Mr. Livingston, one of the inspectors working in the restaurant on Wednesday.
“I knew that someone was dead.”
The authorities found that the dead woman was 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo. She used to work as a head assistant director of the Newark police officer.
Currently, the investigation is taking place to determine whether the death was caused by an intervention by a cosmetic surgeon unidentified under West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet been able to find out what caused Arroya’s death, but they hope that the result of the toxicology tests will light this mysterious death which affected the high ranked workers of the Newark police.
Arroyo, whose voice was known in the department, has been working as an assistant since September 2006 with Garry F. McCarthy's head of police.
"It was loyal, busy and reliable," McCarthy Arroyo said in a Wednesday interview on the phone.
"He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
McCarthy said that Mrs Arroyo was married to the former police officer in Newark, currently working in the Szesipari Products Control Committee, and two, 14 and 11-year-old sons and a mother-in-law were left behind.
Eileen Walsh, the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the investigators were working to find out if Mrs Arroyo was the victim of the intervention of a surgeon without permission.
"The probability is low," Walsh said.
"The investigation is currently underway."
The authorities’ reports show that they arrived to the house at 3:00 p.m. on the afternoon.
On 21th and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the sofa.
He was already declared dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed, and the police have told me very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me if Castro was heard by the detectives.
Participants in the study will examine whether part of the house was functional as a medical doctor.
On Wednesday, no one opened a door at Castro's home, where a thin rose was standing in the narrow front garden, and a song was slapped from the back of the house.
By the door leading to the basement, the car entrance was equipped with a blue tank "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in foods and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes hanged on the other side.
McCarthy recalled that after 25 years of arrival in Newark, Mrs. Arroyo gave him an invaluable help by helping to identify the new city in an unusual and unspeakable political culture.
“He always said, “You’ll be better off with it.”
"He's always been here when I arrived in the morning, and he's always in there when I left tonight.
It was embarrassing."
The expectations of Fed’s interest reduction lead to a shock in the world’s stock markets
The stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic were jumped yesterday after the reassuring statements of the President of the United States Central Bank increased their hopes that Fed would try to ease investment opportunities with additional interest cuts.
Both in London and New York, and across Europe, the stock markets were abandoned after Donald Kohn, who declared President Ben Bernanke’s right hand, would have to react “smartly and pragmaticly” to constantly observeable negligence on financial markets.
In addition to the clear objective of Kohn to reduce markets in the midst of the recurring credit crisis, he stated that the present neglect "partly reversed the progress achieved on the market in the end of September and October".
He said that if increased confusion continues to persist, it could increase the possibility of further constraints on households and companies' credit constraints.
The statements were interpreted by investors by the fact that Fed is ready to inject fresh capital to the US markets or even further interest reductions.
The statements were also reassuring to Wall Street, which has recently been reported by many bad news about the American economy, such as the negative record of the number of American housing sales.
In addition, Bear Stearns’ investment bank has confirmed the negative impact of financial restoration in order to reimburse 650 employees and 4% of their global labour force as part of the cost reduction in the US second-market housing loans sector.
A total of 20 jobs in London are affected by the above measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average index increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent and closed at 13.289,40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 per cent and closed at 6.306.1, and increased the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 per cent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
The restoration of the credit market revived after a large demand auction organised by the European Central Bank by the three-month periods of papers has not been seen since April 2001 at a price of 4.7 per cent to the European banks.
After the English interbank interest rate, Libor reached the highest value seen since September after 12 November, 6,59%, the Bank of England was all under greater pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB, and to allow additional capital to the London financial market.
In England, the decision is made between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
He gave two dilemma, one more complicated than the other.
Who should the English team have the sixth field in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in an indirect context of the first test against Sri Lanka, is it not less important who will make the decision?
The last question is, on the one hand, because David Graveney, the president of the electorate who temporarily performs this particular task, will provide assistance to executive coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. On the other hand, because the account of the English executive director, Hugh Morris’s writing desk begins to fill up with requests to reach national or at least once the electorate position.
Among the two players, it draws the shorter, which does not get the sixth spot, but as known, life, and especially sport often unjust.
It’s never easy to tell you what makes someone’s profession reach the top, while others can’t even reach a lower level. Many times it depends on luck than talent.
Not only is the cricket characteristic that it is difficult to choose - often subjectively - on the basis of the choice.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if that happens?
The same question can be raised in other areas of life, such as when we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, highly skilled young leaders who know the business, while only one of them has a place for one.
Who can tell you which level is a cricket player without throwing it into deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, the data have a major impact on the decision, but opportunities are equally important.
In a team, the player must catch the watch of the captain at the right time in the cricket gate, and a hit player must get a chance to become a big player once.
Looking at the selectionrs is much more complicated.
For example, more than James Anderson played better in the last season, he still counts as a certain team member in the first test, despite the fact that Stephen Harmison is in a good shape and is doing very well.
Anderson fought with 32 first-class gates and 33 runs to participate in the tour.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but both of them have had successful moments at the highest level, and they hope to be like that in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play in Asgiriya Stadion, well, this will be decided on the basis of opinions.
This decision can reproduce or break anyone’s career, but it may also have no special impact on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankán Gareth Batty played every test and performed well with five gates and 40 useful runs, yet Paul Collingwood, who was the one who had been a highlighted and decisive test cricket, which may be underestimated even today, despite the fact that in Australia, the Australians received a double hundred points.
It is likely that, listening to their conservative emotions, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, at their meeting in Asgiriya Stanion, will take their vocals against the young life and dynamics of Bopara.
Both of them are accused of.
Shah is in favour of the bright and successful debuting of the 88-year-old Bopara six-year-old Bopara, who was also in excellent screws, he reached 32-year-olds.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player Shah was at home in May, in Lorda’s test against West Indies only ran ten in two quarters, and that Vaughan, who struggled for his immediate resistance to his succession in the next game, seemed to have reduced the resistance that was still clearly seen in Bombay.
Essex’s universal talent is a lifelong and inexcellent player.
At the cricket track, nothing can be upset, but his behavior outside the track was well characterized when the team broke up at an exhibition with a four-wheeled Volkswagen car sponsor.
However, the first thing he did after was that he took up (naturally sponsored) Vodafone's phone and called his teammate Alastair Cook to ask him, "Have you seen this?"
Bopara is a better career player with classics. It creates a good throw angle for its enclosed medium steps, and its beats are self-confident and good.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and another is the right moment.
Maybe this is the real art of the selection.
I'd personally give Bopara the chance, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would offer a great deal if, as the tea leaves in Ceilon suggest, he would be the one who's playing this weekend.
They bring refugees home with buses to work and take the fight with Al-Qaida
Since yesterday, the first buses arrive from Syria to Bagdad with those Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or have expired their visas, or, in fact, those who hope in the city have returned to order.
There are also people who have come back to take the fight with the soldiers who have taken them out of their house.
The Mansour bus station was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before 800 people from Damascus arrived in the government convoy with dozens of buses.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Bagdad," said Dr. Sabah al-Qubaisi.
“Today I returned because I saw what happened in Bagdad on TV and on the newspapers and that the city is now safe.
"The Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to the Military of Moqtada al-Sadr, who has now shut down his skiite army.
The 38-year-old skiite teacher, Qassim al Atwani, who lived mostly in the Nunnites, returned home with two children because he failed to renew the Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqi from working.
Amariya’s neighbors called him and urged him to return home, saying that with the help of the teams supported by the Americans, Al-Kaida was squeezed out of their bash in the western part of the capital.
One of the first arrivals from Jordan was a sunny and skiith tribe leader who escaped from a granate attack from his home in Sleikh, Sleikh, North Dakota, after he began to encourage his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, my friends called and said they created an anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh, and they need to support me and my sons.
That's why I came back today," said the 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have spoken about the fact that since the involvement of the American teams, they have been seduced by armed civilian forces in the capital.
However, more people were forced to return from Damascus because of visa and financial problems.
The 51-year-old, three-childly Salaam al-Samarrai voiced a broad view of the refugees, according to which Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian government to reject the visa request for refugees to force their return.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people have escaped from the death brigades in the country.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki did not visit Syria and did not pressure the government not to grant more visas to Iraqi in order to move home," said the sunite retired.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
One of the reasons for the relief of violence is that the sunnits were removed from the ski area, while the skies also left the Nunnite lakt regions. As a result, tension in many areas decreased.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will revive the Tuesdays, which may lead to new battles.
Kis Saar Region - Skill training
The smallest federal province plays a leading role in vocational training, and its higher education is also an international orientation.
Only in a training area, the island rural people struggle with the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
“I’ve explained 50 times a day to a non-Saar country that we are not French,” this is an independent slot who advertises it on his posters at the 50th birthday of the smallest federal region.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saar Region, which, based on the surveys of the German Economic Institute (IW), can praise the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions - just because of traditions - work closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948.
Students can complete their studies with a double and even three degrees.
Accordingly, 15.6% of your student is high.
However, the schools and universities of the Saar Region also exercise an attractiveness to wanting to study in the region - many of them do not have high schools.
"In the Saar region, the opportunities of vocational training are exploited," explains Axel Plünnecke, a German Economic Institute of Education.
More than a fifth of young people receive a right of further education at a vocational school, with the area of Saar more than seven percent above the federal average.
The combined opportunities for professional and higher education have also been well developed.
Infrastructure for dual studies is located in Germany in the second place.
Despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, however, the number of graduate engineers decreased by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Agriculture has therefore committed to a marketing trip to higher education institutions at the heart of engineering sciences.
“In general schools, we started a number of reforms after the first Pisa study,” said a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government introduced comparative tests across the country.
To begin learning earlier, the last nursery year is free of charge. It is a model that the other federal domains have also started to copy.
To ensure that students’ performance is continuously improved, only future comparative studies will answer.
Based on the 2003 Pisa Survey, the proportion of the students involved in the risk ranged from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, the overall performance of the Saar region has not improved to the same extent as the rest of the federal province.
The champions count better.
The greatest revenge of the island rural people in the Pisa-feming process is not taken into account the language knowledge - otherwise they could collect bachelors in this area otherwise,
because the language of neighbouring countries is mandatory in high schools - even if the island country is not French.
Chávez turns the hours
In Venezuela, clocks are different in the near future than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez reverses the time meters in the Latin American country for half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez became a laughter in Spain.
As Venezuela’s official newspaper said, the hours will be recycled for four and a half hours compared to Greenwich’s time under a new law.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone which is not used in any other country in the world.
The U.S. Anti-Chávez, among other things, justified its decision that the United States forced all-hour-based time zones to the world.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday the interruption of relations with the neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage.
The left-wing nationalist politician stated that until the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains the President of Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Colombia government will be in contact.
"I can't do this because of my own dignity," said Chávez, who calls for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the Oil country have to make an opinion within the framework of a referendum on Sunday.
The reform would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for the debate was Uribe's decision to deport his mandate from Chávez to negotiate with marxist rebels in Colombia on the release of hostages.
Uribe's decision "arcul coughed" Venezuela, given a sound of criticism of Chávez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez.
In the country, a new cellular bell sound has appeared: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth), - that's the phrase that has been spent on the internet by more than half a million people.
The sentence comes from King Charles, Spain, who was so upset by the permanent interims of the populist politicians in Ballodae at the latest Latin America Summit.
In 2007, wage reduction threatens the Germans
A prediction is that this year there is a threat to German workers despite the strong conjuncture.
Professionals have supported their pessimistic forecasts with chocolate indices.
According to the estimates of the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, employees can actually pay less in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The reason for this modest wage development, the increase in the general traffic tax and the rapid increase in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn, a member of the Macroeconomic and Conjunkture Research Institute.
In terms of unemployment insurance, additional burdens can be imposed on workers.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück stated in the statement on the “Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung” newspaper that, in the current situation, the reduction of correct and reasonable unemployment insurance to 3.3% at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be placed in such a difficult position to apply to the Alliance for credit or support, quoted the German Social Democratic Party, the politician of the SPD.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products has resulted in the highest inflation for 13 years.
In the annual comparison, prices increased by 3 per cent.
Venus is the devil twin brother of the Earth
Despite the aerodrome of Venus, it is more similar to the Earth than it has been presumed to be: European "Venus Express" spacezone lightnings in the atmosphere, and on the corners of the corners, it has discovered windshields as they are born in winter on Earth.
In nearly three decades, scientists assume that the Venuson is lightning.
The European "Venus Express" spacezone has provided evidence - it has discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The Venuson lightnings spread on wheels of 56 kilometres from the cloud to the cloud, reports Christpher Russel, a colleague from the University of Los Angel.
According to the famous "unfamous theory", Earth’s life was caused by lightnings: The theory says the zivatars have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the development of the amino acids, the builders of life.
Not like Venus, “If there was ever a life there, it could be in the very early days,” Sean Solomon explains from the Washington Carnegie Institute.
Currently, living organisms can hardly exist on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere on wheels is hundreds of times denseer than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the helly twin brother of the earth, but still his twin brother,” he nailed Russel.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus is so similar in the mass and size of the Earth, in a full way of development.
"Venus Express" was a milestone in the Venezuelan research in November 2005, because none of the sons have been on their way to explore this planet since the early nineties.
The latest research results already presented in the article "Nature" are not only proven by researchers in the Venezuelan solar system.
“They also point out that the similarity of the neighbouring planet to the Earth is greater than we first assumed,” said Esa.
The researchers, alongside the already known northern archipelago rotation band, have discovered a much faster motion cloud on the southern corner.
The phenomenon reminds the air flows of the Earth’s winter hemisphere, says the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of the solar system is almost the same as the Earth, and the diameter of 12.100 kilometres is almost the size of the Earth.
The sky body called the Estonian Star will be avoided in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower around its own tent: a vein day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although the 460 Celsius-focus surface temperature of Venus 92 bar is hardly reminded of the Earth, scientists start with the fact that both planets were born in completely similar circumstances.
Both of them gathered water, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while the Venus went to the universe.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth was bound in carbon rocks, Venuson is a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler protects Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Mr Köhler, the German President of the Republic, demands the conclusion of the debate between the parties that exploded around the reception of the Dalai Lama in Chancellaria.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the September bet.
The German President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s authority and called on the Grand Coalition to end the debate that was confronted with the reception of Dalai Lama.
“We should not be a divided nation in this issue,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
Köhler at the same time expressed his understanding that Angela Merkel, Chancellor (CDU), welcomed the Dalai Lama in September.
“ Human rights are universally applicable to me even if I respect the differences between cultures,” Köhler underlined.
Everyone is aware of the need for Germany to look at the external political balance, stressed the President of the Republic; however Merkel has been defending against the accusation that the Chancellor would continue to pursue a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor did not break up with the traditional "China" policy.
China is aware of this," Köhler pointed it out.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister of Foreign Affairs (SPD), in an indirect way, gave a noise over the reception of the Dalai Lama, and therefore became the target of attacks in the Union.
Steinmeier, among other things, complained of the EU's "love policy" in the field of foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama Chancellaria office, there were severe disruptions in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, China’s leadership not only called the German Minister for Finance, Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to SPIEGEL’s information, frozen the so-called ‘Strategia Paris’ between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.
Wen Jiabao, Chinese Head of State, has now called on the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that it was a mistake to accept the Dalai Lama.
China rejects if European politicians accept the religious leader of Tibetans in their official quality, wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama’s actions and words pointed out that he is trying to remove Tibetan and other Tibetan regions that today include Tibetan.
Schäuble protects from disruptions like France
Street conflicts with the police, shootings, lighting cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects from disruptions similar to the French.
It is necessary to do everything to ensure that social discomfort in Germany does not distort street violence, demands the federal Minister of Interior.
Barricades burned, dating rifles shot with beer guns on the police: after the serious disruption of young people in France, Wolfgang Schäuble, Federal Minister of Interior (CDU), in Germany, has similar developments.
“We need to say that social explosives do not accumulate and do not fall into violence.
We have to take it seriously," he said to the newspaper "Neue Presse" in Hannover.
Not all young people are adapting to rapid changes in social reality.
Allies, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to solve problematic cases, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes have already been shown.
However, it is too early to solve the emergency.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there are no urban and social problems in the German precincts, such as France.
In the northern precincts of Paris, young people have fought serious street fights with the police in the last night.
There were also cars and public buildings in Toulouse.
Taking this into account, the federal government, head of the German Turkish communities, demanded a greater degree of activity in the field of integration.
With regard to the disruptions in France, Kolat warned the dangers of "reproduction".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
But action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that among young people under 25 years of age from immigrant families the unemployment rate is "higher than the average".
Before all, more education should be provided.
Kolat said, "We need to provide a peer-relevant for young people."
However, the head of the Turkish Community added that "the social supervision within the family" is more present in Germany than in France.
Many young people from an immigrant family do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat warns, "Despite this, we need to be in a hole."
For young people, “the quicker they need to be able to work and learn.”
Meanwhile, in the city of Paris, Villier-le-Bel had full peace during the night.
Hundreds of police officers were ready to launch, a helicopter with a headlight paaching the area.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests and some flammable garbage and cars.
Since reporting, a 1000-person security unit on wheels has taken care of peace.
Police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, the Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after his visit to the city.
During the Tuesday night, 80 police officers were wounded on wheels due to the disruptions of Villiers-le-bel.
Next night, the disruptions spread to Toulouse.
The trails occurred in connection with a traffic accident, during which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the Public Prosecutor, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
Cloud in Angela's Empire
The action of the Chancellor has come from reality is a proof that coalition is going to end - and there is no expectation of it anymore.
In which country does the Federal Chancellor live?
In the general debate made by Bundecag, it is necessary to establish after its indifferent and unspeakful action: not here - not in the country whose governance would be his job.
He rejected the accusation with a very high sentence, Angela Merkel, that he would focus too much on foreign policy.
It is provincial, responded, and in such a way he only gave the expression that he did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Federal Assembly, it made it clear to everyone how good the grains are.
At the same time, there was no specific interest or empathy for the country’s problems.
Instead, the Cloud Angela emerged: a politician who has been deployed from reality, who escapes into foreign politics and there is only his own insecurity.
Examples of climate protection: Helyligendammi’s Decisions are unstoppable, but he will listen to how to achieve the climatisation targets in the country.
In any case, as far as your self-compliment is concerned, such modesty would not have been allowed by the President of the CDU two years before.
Now you're getting into that frustration that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
It hurts his good news as a pragmatic person who provides a solution to problems instead of speakers.
However, cloudwife Angela's empire has internal policy problems just a few side-effects.
Child poverty and the problems of low-income people?
This is just a few semesters.
It’s a lot of controversial about how often it’s done in language failure when it comes to family supplements.
Merkel has to go on three times to bring together a half-year-old sentence.
If it's specific, it's in an alien area.
Roham Division
During his debate on Youtube, the Republican presidential candidates had a hard shift between the two favours, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, and now they have to be held from an external candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already come up with the first topic.
Mitt Romney tells the opponent Rudy Giuliani that he made New York a "complimentary immigrant".
“I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants,” he cuts back to Giuliani, and he pledged to the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts that he had no documents as an individual.
As the Republican camp continues to have no unanimous favour, eight presidential expectants use the debate on CNN before all to undermine the credit of its opponent.
The videos sent by internet users through Youtube are hardly more than short summarys.
"We brought Hitler into power by this type of Isolacionism," John McCain rubbed under his opponent Ron Paul's nose, who demands immediate withdrawal from Iraq as the only participants of the circle.
Romney’s head is also thoroughly washing Vietnam on the veteran when it comes to condemning the so-called "Waterboarding", the interrogation method during which water washing is simulated.
However, that the important topics of the campaign are located beyond discussions on Iraq and torture, the responses to the audience of St. Petersburg in Florida.
There is a loud taps in the room when conservative values are praised and refusing future tax increases.
At the same time, the weaknesses of the two candidates are increasingly shown.
“I was wrong,” Romney repented and apologized to the supporters and TV viewers for making the vox even in 1994 with the abortion of pregnancy.
Giuliani, however, is inclined when he asks for a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first rules as a civilian
One day after the retreat of the army, Musharraf was defeated as President of power in Pakistan.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, took place on Thursday for a further five-year term of office.
The Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the capital, the Islamabad presidential palace.
Musharraf has sworn to the constitution and that his people are doing for the benefit of it.
On Wednesday, he gave his military executive office to his confidential Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus allowed all the international pressure from the United States.
The former general, eight years after the breakdown of power in the form of a military coup, is now governing the first time as the Head of State of Civil Affairs.
Musharraf, acting as the chief commander of armed forces, complied with a fundamental demand of the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the eradication of an exceptional condition, which Musharraf announced on 3 November.
Malik Muhammad Qayyum said that Musharraf would no longer remove the extraordinary state to meet a further demand for the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf was placed at the beginning of November following the publication of the extraordinary state, has rejected any objection to the contested re-election of the Head of State in the last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers lost their lives due to an attack against a military convoy in northern Vaziristan.
According to the information reported by the Army spokesman, the bomb exploded on the road near the Afghanistan border.
The Fathers of Crautrock return
The German super team of the seventies again musically: Harmonia’s three band members rebuilt his instrument until the power of a Berlin concert.
At the time of the reunion of their light age, a cut tape appears from the "Live 1974" time.
At that time, they were well known abroad.
The reported sensation killed the body in the person of the three agreed men around the dinner table.
In each case, your own instrument, your own cable and above all your own buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the middle of his 63 years of snow-white shirt.
Michael Rother, who has been young at the age of 57 from the left, offers an escort in possession of a laptop and guitar.
From the right side of the audience, Hans-Joachim Roedelius is 73-year-old and focuses on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, including once and for all rhythms.
This is sometimes a traditional music.
However, all of this seems not particularly disturbing the masters.
It was great excitement to the people of the crautrock music direction that Harmony had a band with music again.
What we can tell here: As a result of a proper follow-up, we can find that the name went through the collective pop memorial, but in no case did he leave any permanent traces to miss this band painfully after 32 years.
Why can’t the Germans celebrate the legends of their seventy years?
Especially that what we call misleadingly crautrock is always appreciated in England and America more than in their own country.
When the music industry was awarded the Echo award for the living members of the Cologne Can in 2003, the German pop figures were sitting in an inconsistent face in the room.
When Red Hot Chili Peppers lauded even the La Düsseldorf and Neu! thanks to the bands, the admiration became unlimited.
At the concerts, Michael Rother sat with Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage as an old friend.
The same coin is two sides of domestic rejection and foreign acceptance.
The memory is already overloaded by Harmony because the trio existed for only two years, and during this time it has had a far less effect than others were subsequently attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius played music with Conrad Schnitzler before under the many-promising Cluster name.
At first, they played at the basement under the Schaubühne theater in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, economic considerations for a album company funded by the Church.
Rother has helped Kraftwerk for a short time, and, in parallel, the most radical German band, Neu!, has gained a reputation.
In 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster's musicians into their exile in Weserbergland Forst.
There, Alter Weserhof, lived in a 16th-century Roman city as a communer.
Less ideologically, than in the Communion I, where Roedelius was still in trouble as a babysitter.
Their lives are more idyllic arts.
The flag of the Harmony Ottenstein Dictionary was found from the garbage and found a name as their art.
There are some things in Harmony.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next album "De Luxe".
Despite his lazy and modest music, the band suffered financial needs.
The hose collection alone did not guarantee the finding of themselves.
The CD released at "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert held in Griessem, in front of nearly 50 people's records, so someone remembers.
Harmony and occasional exercise were the idea of Rother.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced its division in 1975.
Rother ended up at the Ezoteric and held himself from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster has been revived in the eighty-century years, which has been more successful than Harmony has ever been.
The live album of Griessemi is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His album company who studied the name of Grönland aims to care for the crautrock as a special German donation of live music.
In this context, Neu! has been dug the same way as Roedelius.
The resurrection of Harmony will take place in the House of Berlin Culturals.
In public money, within the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of our British autumn and "Krautrock Sampler" is also present.
Loveparade's idea manager, Dr. Motte, is also present.
This is about the impact of crautrock on the next pop music age.
In this regard, Harmonia fills the space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's finding with the most unusual voices floats in the room: "The only true music is his future."
There are pictures that represent the producer with Harmony in a farmhouse room.
Other black and white photos of wireless cable equipment serves to build legends.
In the hallway, three veterans are reconstituted with improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are recorded to the orgo and drum equipment with the intention to deceive audio effects from the instruments by means of their own audio effects.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three, deepened in technology.
Even the homework doesn't change anything.
During Barbara Morgenstern's leadership, they cough and pussy and feel "Aaaaaaaah!" in a beautiful part.
The crautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were searched less in blues than in musical schools (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in pre-payment of artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here screams "'68!", they don't go on the wrong road, and Harmonia doesn't even leave you alone.
Even the most understandable thing is thought carefully on the stage.
Where does music begin, and where does it end?
This can nervely inspire a man or offer him the moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
Through "Westing" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two movies are repeatedly dealing with the Balkan War.
None of them are convincing.
The basic thought or too much is aimed at action and shooting, or too emotional.
Richard Gere doesn't even help you in "Westing".
First of all, the good news is: Although the two war criminals, Karadzsics and Mladics still hid in the mountains of the Balkans, there, in the dark back of the Bosnian war, they found the actress Richard Gere again.
Recently, we lost our eyes on the most beautiful men of the eighty-century years, as the emotional films for women played a number of good-boy-non-milliant roles and the numerous press conferences in the Buddhism topic even took us to look at.
And here is, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most impressive argument in addition to the fact that we might still look at the "Wathing" film.
It provides a wonderful, humiliating design: In principle, Simon Hunt’s activist was exactly what Gere could have become in that case if the fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who left his most beautiful years behind for a long time, but still retained a significant part of his romous monuments.
However, the German "Mörderischer Frieden" film and also this week began to show up, despite this adu, only continues the infinite series of films on the war of the Balkans.
We don't have to waste much of the word on the film "Mörderischer Frieden": The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who are saving a Serbian woman from Kosovo's snipers, and one of them suddenly loves her.
Although it is welcome that once the Serbians are not depicted as the only causes of all evil, the film bearing the secretity of the TV films is too quickly lost in the shooting and in the event-failing scenes.
Cobra's carrying a "11" celebration, instead of a motorway, in war.
On the other hand, in the case of hunting, it can be explored in an exemplary way why there is no really good movie on the Balkan war.
The three U.S. marshals who are stirring up to search for the Serbian war criminals, other directors, other directors (the two in Richard Shepard's Perszonal Union) in another age could have become a new "Apocalypse" now.
The stories show a surprising similarity: In both cases, small groups will cut him to the forest to carry out what the army is incapable of - and in both cases the trip to madness is insane.
One of the reasons for the fall of the hunting is that Simon Hunt is simply not allowed to be an obsessive cynical student to his heart as he is presenting him at the beginning.
No, and as a result, he spent a romantic relationship with a woman who was murdered later.
The "Wathing" will slide in the last five minutes of the film, when the reporters achieved in the form of an accelerated recording that all of Nato, the CIA and the world were unable to do in five years: they will capture the warrior, then hand him over to the mohamed witches for fair revenge.
This is so bad that a person would most like to go to the Hágan International Court of Justice for the crime committed against the cinema logic.
The aim of the film is deeply human.
He intends to put Karadzsics and Mladics on the ground and suspects the Americans and the French (even exceptionally uniform) that secret political agreements do not carry out the persecution intensively intensively.
But good and evil sometimes are so similar to each other that a famous Brecht-vers will come to mind.
In this poet writes the following about the Asian demon on the desk: "I look at the desk on the ground, which tells me how tired it is to be."
Films like "Westing" have the same size as human-headed masks, which show how tired to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of movies about the war in the Balkans.
It was recently reported in the newspaper that all the Hollywood films about Iraq had been a rude fall.
We can add: There is not yet any good movies about South Africa.
It’s almost always true: if a star is in the world’s crises or window fields, it’s like "The paths of freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "with no borders" Angelina Jolie or "The Bloody Diamond" Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close to time.
They had to be decades, while Hollywood was able to film a good movie on the holocaust with the movie "Schindler's list".
Probably a few movies are still coming in - because the creations of the Vietnam War, which are now considered classic, such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett", were not celebrated in their time as unanimously masterpiece.
But it can be imagined that today, when all mass murders arrive in our home in real time, immediately through two screens, we simply know too much about the conflicts of the world.
And this will deprive the script writers of the enlightenment of reality, which would be needed to tell good stories.
"Being or not being a dictator" or "The dictator" eventually succeeded because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how terrible my Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't try to do good if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we need to place the novel in Lawrence Norfolk's sarcastically remote artistic vision.
When his historic novel "The Lemprière-Lexikons" and his parallels between the Balkan War were asked, he said, "This only depends on the fact that certain things never change.
Large cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and in Yugoslavia there will always be war.”
Von Beust is severely criticized by the cancellation of the Olympics
The mayor's decision-making of the proposal for the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg has triggered strong criticism in political and economic life.
Many want to continue to fight for the organisation of water games.
Von Beust, however, is strongly alerted to realities during the selection of chances.
The Director-General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday, considered the retirement to be "negative to the economic environment".
No other project has recently released such huge motivation forces in the city than the Olympic idea.
Without this goal, we cannot keep sports policy momentum equally."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative "which starts from modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his earlier statement that the ambitions of Hamburg’s Olympic Games were not real until 2028.
"It's not Hamburg that decides on the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Association," said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
The Sports Association was expected to decide on the Munich application for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games.
"The advantage of this means that we will not have real opportunities within the period that we have thought before 2028."
However, we do not give up the dream forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed its regret over the statements of von Beust.
This makes it an impression that Hamburg in the next 25 years does not intend to apply for Olympic Games.
“It’s too early to rifle a chance to bury our plans now,” said Günter Ploß, President of HSB on Wednesday.
In addition, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement made by the Senate President at the General Assembly of the General German College of Sports Society.
It was the case that Von Beust Hamburg’s 2011 Univerziadera was not a substitute for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The College Sports Association has only launched Hamburg as a city participating in the application last week.
The civil group of SPD told the Senate that he left a valuable time in terms of housing building in Hamburg.
"The development of the Kleiner Grasbrook has been postponed for the years of Senate, because he voted alongside the Olympics and avoided building of the apartment," two SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has constantly broken the chain alongside the integrated plan of the Olympic and subsequent housing use for Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU was one-sided to the "inclusion factor".
During the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the proposal was very enthusiastic in Hamburg.
However, he failed in Hamburg Lipcsé.
These are not Warhol's boxes
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and village to each other is Ikea and does not mean Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, the walls produced in Sweden put a dark shade on the list of Warhol works.
The majority of the ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Box are fake.
After a few months ago of the Swedish "Expressen" page, Andy Warhol doubted the originality of Brillo Boxes in 1968, now the internal investigation of the Modern Museet in Stockholm has come to an incredible result: Pontus Hultén, the former museum manager of the former museum in 1995, a copy of the six "Brillo Box" provided by Moderna Museet in 1995, and is likely to be a hundred more "Stockholm type" Brillo Box on wheels on the international art market.
A chain of long and complicated, artistic and curatorial mutations.
Warhol was created in 1964 by the first "Brillo Boxes", based on the red-blue-white shape.
In a 1968 Moderna Museet exhibition, Warhol agreed to produce hundreds of Brillo boxes: These (for cost savings) were not from Warhol, but transported directly from the Brillo map factory.
It was not artwork, it was their templates, simple exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission to manufacture some of the Brillo villages in Sweden, which were not produced in Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the age are now talking about fifteen boxes that were then certified as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the title "Stockholm type" in the art and auction history.
Some of them were sold for over $100,000.
However, the problem is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum manager, was falsely claiming that in 1968 there were hundreds of your walls on wheels produced and produced in Sweden, which then left Warhol.
In fact, Hultén 105 boxes were produced only in 1990 in Malmö for a Saint-Pétervár exhibition.
During that time, Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the moderna Museet’s main monument manager, looked at three boxes of Swedish private ownership, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed spindles were first covered and removed, and then they took the white oil paint.
Contrary to the structure of copies from 1990, the paint was brought directly to the spinal sheet without foundation - it is not oil, but a crystal.
"These boxes were not certified by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, Director of Moderna Museet, "If the New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' decides otherwise, the Six Boxes in the Collection of Moderna Museet will be classified as copies/export material."
The Authentication Board announced, of course, that in June, he was investigating the serious accusations of soap powder boxes.
Since then, they have been concealed in unquestionable listening.
Manilai Rebel Soldiers
In the Philippines, the soldiers who bariqued themselves at a hotel in Manila and demanded the failure of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot take responsibility for bloodshed, said to reporters at the hotel his leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Before that, government-friendly soldiers attacked the hotel.
The two dozens of soldiers have been in the building for hours.
Half of the team was in court on Thursday due to the failed attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly dissolve wheels with 30 sympathetics.
The military police, who was responsible for the man's guards, clearly joined and joined the melting.
They invaded the Peninsula-Hotel and then demanded the failure of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government-famous units have closed the area of the excellent hotel.
The president called the security office to an extraordinary meeting.
Norberto Gonzales' Security Advisor condemned military proceedings.
"They have enough for people," said Trillanes.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, formerly Commander of the Scout Rangers elite, stated that the military's other units wanted to join in a short period of time.
Government critics called for a strong protest against the president on Friday.
His government has been shaded by corruption charges for several months.
Manila’s financial district was already the main scene in 2003 for the attempt to revolve against Arroyo, organized by 200 members of the Army’s wheels.
The uprising failed only 24 hours ago when the army joined.
Since 1986 at least seven puck attempts have been carried out in the Philippines against democratically elected governments.
The United Internet will be a major part of Versatel
The United Internet has more than 20% of its share in the Versatel Telecommunication Company.
As the company said Wednesday night, the average price per share is 14.46 Euros.
This represents 20,05% of the capital.
Before that, there were thoughts on the wing.
The possibility of raising the share of ownership in Versatel remains open.
By this step, the German DSL market is intended to be consolidated by the United Internet.
Before this, there were assumptions on Wednesday about a possible link after Berenberg Bank increased its share in the Düsseldorf network service provider by further 5% to 15.1%.
The financial institution maintains its share only as a third party, is reported on the money market.
On the previous day, the United Internet owned a limited 10% of Drillisch’s mobile phone company.
Within the framework of the capitalisation, Drillisch set 17,4 million new shares at EUR 106,4 million.
The United Internet purchased 5.15 million shares for €31.4 million.
In addition, companies have initiated a dialogue on cooperation in the dumping of DSL and mobile phone products on the market.
"We're uniting our partner relationship," said United-Internet's spokesman.
The two companies jointly established the MSP Joint Undertaking for the reception of the competitor Freenet.
In the beginning, the two companies are satisfied with a good 10% share in Freenet and do not live with the right to take over 18.49% of Freenet, said on Thursday the United Internet.
However, the two companies leave all the options open, especially with regard to increasing their shareholding in Freenet AG, the news.
Negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on strategic partnership were concluded in the middle of November.
For months around the Freenet, poker play with a case-wind is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunication market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet was a 2.9 million contracted mobile phone client and a customer with 1.27 million DSL and wireless access.
The United Internet and Drillisch holding company have had a 6.01% share in Freenet.
Drillisch has now agreed to bring four percent of the additional wheel.
An agreement on the right to purchase 18.49% of the Vatas investment company was reached in August.
