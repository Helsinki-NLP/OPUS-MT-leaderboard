The victory of the right-wing populists in Austria, with a total of 29 percent
The two partys of the major coalition have felt deteriorating and the significant strengthening of the populist parties on the right hand, according to the first preliminary results, the Austrian pre-parliament elections on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party, where the current President Wilhelm Molterer's position was seriously affected, was particularly severely lost.
On the other hand, the President of the Association for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Prime Minister of Karintia, Jörg Haider, is preparing to return to national politics.
Based on the preliminary results, the country's strongest party remains with 29.8% of the votes and 5.5% of the votes lost compared to the recent 2006 elections.
The EVP has worsened, which loses nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst outcomes that have been achieved in the history of both major parties after the war in Austria, and in particular in the People's Party for Prevented Elections, the result is literally catastropheful.
At the beginning of July, when the EVP coalition was withdrawn, the party had a significant advantage before the SPÖ, according to public opinion research.
However, the voters seem to have been punished for letting the government fail.
In the first responses to the results, speculations have already been made about the possible cancellation of the party Wilhelm Molterer and the current alkancellor.
The observers believe that this can take place on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party.
This development is likely to make it easier for the election outcome to renew the SPÖ and ÖVP large coalition.
Given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ), 18% of the votes in advance and 11% of the votes in BZÖ, however, the Social Democrats voted for their fear of the recurring of the year 1999, when the People's Party agreed in common government with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at the time of the time, and in 2005, the BZÖ became part of the BZÖ), which also caused sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and I assume he can return to Vienna in national politics, obviously counts on this solution.
The Party of Greens, which, however, has lost some of its popularity and has fallen from the third place between the Austrian political parties to the fifth.
None of the other parties crossed the four hundred-dollar border and failed to reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations can be cooled
If it fails to solve the problem of Czech scientists who were unlawful for the collection of bugs, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said there could be some obscurity in the Czech-Indian relations.
This was published by the minister in New York after meeting with Mukherdzsi Pranáb, an Indian partner today.
“If it wasn’t resolved, yes, a certain obsolete event would occur,” he said after the meeting that took place from Czech stimulation.
After the trial, Mukherdzsi told me that the executive power could be difficult to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, which has been released and punished by fine, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership of Darjeelingi, whose law is part of the case.
“My problem could be solved,” the minister said.
Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, said, however, it would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
He would then be free to apply for a warranty, and he would be free to wait for the judgment, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial.
"It was recommended to appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to save him," said Czech diplomacy chief.
The only way to intervene in the whole case is the Czech party, the condemned to provide "competent legal support", said the Indian minister.
At the same time, the Indian party already gave them such help.
“Our main interest is to maintain the best relationships with India with many years of tradition.
This is acknowledged by the Indians," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to the ČTK, his partner emphasised that the Czech Republic is of great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We believe that it is a serious mistake to imprison and charge these Czech scientists,” he said.
To the question whether the Indian Party has been promised to deal with the case, the minister has removed the answer.
“I’ve had a lot of promises,” he noted.
Czech judges in the battle for the bottom of the sea
He enters a wall electronic map where Australia and neighbouring sea areas are visible.
But it is not interested in the land, it is a point that disappears in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and is also the neighbouring sea base.
During the area as much as the continent itself,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member working group on the ocean and maritime law of the United Nations Division.
Chief Václav Mikulka, Czech lawyer, director of the division, monitors the explanation that is sometimes supplemented.
Work and enthusiasm are dominated here.
The bottom of the sea is rich in natural resources, and it has not yet been known.
It can be found here in stone oil, melt and other minerals, but it is also unknown to live organisms that could be the key to developing, for example, a medicine against cancer.
Sea bases greater than dry land
The coastal states today are intensively applying for new underwater areas.
According to the United Nations Convention, their rights are enforced, which were agreed in 1982 in the Jamaican Montego Bay.
It is primarily about the so-called continental site, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometres from the coasts of that country.
Under the Convention, such a country has a exclusive right to all sources of the continental pad.
"We keep a simpler, continental paddle of the bottom of the sea and the underground layer, which is the natural continuation of the under sea.
The coastal sea borders, often over 200 sea miles, are beyond the only economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the country concerned to the Commission determining the external borders of the continental page shall be accompanied by a wide range of scientific and technical documentation based on cost-effective research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"Our task is legal and professional assistance to the Committee.
The Committee has so far discussed five applications, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have succeeded,” Mikulka added.
In the world, Australia’s success has recently echoed, which has first significantly expanded its underwater country.
But New Zealand has also won - the area of the sea bottom judged by the Committee is about 1.6 million square kilometres, which is six times larger than the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from the future use of the seafene are hoped to be invaluable.
Other countries are constantly submitting their requests.
They can do this within ten years of ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental landscape ends, the Convention begins with the territory of the ocean bottom declared by the common heritage of humanity.
There is no single country here.
The right to extraction in this area is determined by the international institution established by the Convention.
"But the bottom of the sea is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, "one of its areas were legally clearly surrounded and established in the treaty of their regime."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the sea bottom is now also the Czech Republic.
This former Eastern Block is divided into other countries within the common "Interoceanmetal" organization.
In 1991, this organization received the status of a so-called "router investor" as investors in some other countries.
You have the right to produce ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Zone between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area reviewed by the investor is slightly higher than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom of the sea is a copy of the Tatra under sea.
“A total of 75 000 square kilometres can be produced.
The area is a rich site of polymethane, containing nickel, receivable, cobalt and manganese," mentions another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a member of the division in Macedonia, presents another example of the concert.
He reminds me of a potato or a little fantasy of the pergamen with the magical novels of the Golem.
German special forces were present at the freedom of hostage
The Egyptian government asked Germany to help solve the hostage crisis, and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not engaged.
The release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt is becoming more and more details of the sun.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, indirectly German special forces were involved in the rescue operation.
In addition to the German Federal Army specialists, GSG 9, the German Federal Police and the Federal Crime Office were also logistical experts at the site of the release.
According to the information from the Ministry spokespersons on Monday evenings, German forces were not required, however, because hostages were allowed to run their prisoners and then escaped when they recognized the signs of violent hostage.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as a local support force.
"It was fortunately not done," said the spokesman of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers kidnapped the tourist groups of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian women and eight Egyptian escorts in the south of Egypt on September 19th.
After the abduction of the South Egyptian desert, the hostages were hurled here and in the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostages has remained unambiguous until now, as well as details of the release of hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the rescued arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of release were not expressed.
In Berlin, there was no information on when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, five tourists and special forces arrive in Germany on Tuesday at German Air Haderők Airbus.
The U.S. Assembly rejects the ambulance package.
The US Congress's lower house failed the 700 billion dollar rescue package for money markets by a small majority.
Dow Jones fell deep.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package by 227 votes not 206 against the financial markets.
Despite the calls from the American President George W. Bush and the political leaders of both parties, the programme was not received by the majority to prevent the chaos in the financial markets.
The supporters desperately attempted to convince the critics of the need for a $700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank called on representatives to support one of the negotiating leaders of the Democrat Party, even if the plan is still unfavourable.
“It’s easy to get political support to avoid something that has not yet happened,” he said.
During the vote, Dow Jones fell by more than 6% and 600 points.
The investors were concerned about the failure of the state rescue package.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote and then fell again after the failure to make the public.
Experts account for additional major turbulences in international financial markets.
To enter into force of the programme, both the Parliament and the Senate should be approved.
The directors register more and more reservations.
It is a good winter for German travellers.
According to a study, the traffic of the following months has increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent of the winter season.
Despite the weak conjunktural prospects, the Germans’ travel enthusiasm is not devastated.
In the winter season reservations, travel agencies booked a 31% increase in traffic compared to the previous year's period - described on Monday in Berlin the German Travel Association (DRV).
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of reservations for autumn months is higher.
The traffic of travel offices in October was 11 percent higher than October 2007, and DRV said.
These results are based on GfK data that evaluates the monthly booking data of the 1200 German travel agency and then extrapolates it to the whole market.
The Institute took into account travel booked by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak price rate, especially travel to the United States, DRV said.
The number of reservations increased here by a third of the wheels.
In addition, the Germans are particularly popular travel targets, as well as Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic landscapes.
Most importantly, the routes were searched, said Klaus Laepple, President of the DRV.
Due to the increasing energy and food costs, the costs of the routes organised can be better calculated for passengers than for individually organised travels.
Passengers can save money with reservation discounts or all inclusive offers - added Laepple.
The booking rate of summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to book traffic growth again compared to the previous year - although a second study suggests that less German tourists have undertaken to travel compared to the previous year.
My First Oktober Painting
Without a break, repetitive ballermann slagers, literal snacks and fashion dirndlit celebrities.
Debuting is Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are not much like each other.
He's a blonde, television director, and he's wearing a custom dirndal.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my clothes in the turkey.
One thing, however, connects us: we are only three minutes in Wiesnen, we are already run by photographers and filling up their memory cards - very flattering, and this is all on my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we can make friends.
It seems that cheap dirndli is fulfilling its purpose.
As a local Wiesn tourist from the white sausage to the north, my comfort is still bound by the folk flow.
But when you arrive at Theresienwies, it's not so bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears dirndals or leather pants; no one is looking back or embarrassed - everything is completely fine.
It's a strange look at the chocolate banana stand just the dirndli bond.
A müncheni woman draws my attention that I made the bond badly: "You're free, you're a virgin, you're right, you're a widow in the back."
I secretly crossed the massage from behind to left.
“That’s good,” he says, and laughs.
Others have fewer drives around fine flirt techniques, and they wear a simple prick base with "I'm too drunk to dress up" label and unquestionably show their naked back.
The young man who exhibits exhibits is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find is very fantastic, expanding the "aaaaaa" long.
He tells me all of this after he got rid of the content of his previously drinked whisper.
Right next to one of the firefighters everyone looks like garbage.
So, Bob is one of the famous "sleepers in the ground."
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o’clock in the evening, the ambulances go to the scene and take care of the poor couples.
Patient nurses always appear in a team - at the same time, four carry tents from tent to tent with a covered bearing bed.
This works as for most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, leaving is packed.
Who is lying in the alcohol coffin under the pond, it doesn't appear.
“These are those who are fully ready,” he cried to me for one of my questions and then in the forgate.
The police named the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and the hospital.
The Brentwood resident, Chelmsford Road resident, Carole Paulson and Carole Paulson, had an accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road, in the city.
He was sent to the hospital called Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with a suspicion of uninterrupted driving.
He has been released against bail.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Before Turkey had intended to join the European Union, European powers were burned from the desire to deepen their entry into the Turkish back.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, is one of the greatest relics of the failed empire.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neorenesan style.
At least the roadbooks write this.
The building is surrounded by the end of the perons, a torony at each front corner, and it looks like a German rural city house.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little overwhelming.
However, in view of the inside of the store’s ticket office, it is clear how big the company had the most Western gates.
The station was opened by the German Consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the “smart future” of conquerions, through this Damascus Bagdadon, wanted to achieve its ambitions to take the Middle East.
The German tribes of Conquest have collapsed during World War I.
Railway routes were attacked by Arab Lawrence and Arab parties.
Relative insulation from surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War have disappeared.
The British Colombian Army has withdrawn from Egypt and squeezed the Turkishs and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station wasn't much better.
In 1917, a shooting train exploded and destroyed the well-developed roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
Since then, he was slowly ruined, and his history went far beyond.
At the same time, today, as the train gates to the Anatólia and the entire Eastern region, at least symbolicly, serve as a distant diplomatic horizon in Turkey.
The Party of Truth and Development in the Government - the ACP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative insulation from surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War have disappeared.
The new policy is the metal of commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq, Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I went to the capital of Turkey, the night train in Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish parliamentary representative Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours after the blurred, which gave the famous documentary about the old world, the "The Night Mail" rhythm, I arrived in the capital of Turkey. The new city is designed to be a symbol of the new world state, which turns back to the past.
However, ACP is a paradigm change with well-known Islamic roots in the Turkish consensus.
This has caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I went with a taxi to the ACP headquarters, an ultramodern, stone and steel, expressly to this purpose building - which is in a developing suburban district, between half-finished shopping centres and coffee houses. In the latter, we meet with suited middle leaders - both men and women - to make a deal early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have added it to a better-centered politician in any other European country.
He wore a dress, a tie, and I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The political goal of the party is to help Turkey reintegrate into the direct environment.
The Cold War broke the order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from its back.
He had to turn east and west at the same time today.
He could not choose from the two.
He had to open both directions.
"But is it possible that you have to make a choice sooner or later?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to get to an answer."
He then stressed what almost everyone I was talking to here, and then almost machinely repeated: Turkey, not only the Middle East, but also the relations with the countries around the Caucasus and the Black Sea, serve the same advantage for Europe and the United States, as for itself.
It is like they want to send a message that, in a sense of transfer, with Turkey, all Europe can get to Asia and the Middle East on those roads to the east.
When I was at the Hydarpasha station again, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemans who looked at the recovery of this decorative building 100 years ago.
They would have been wondering if they knew that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey's hands.
And as soon as I was waiting for the ferry to return to Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was called the sick man of Europe.
At least then, there was no question of which part of the land to hold a demand for this exciting country.
Remembrance paths: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: since 1962, as music director of Guildford, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologue, sept. 11) led the Philharmonic Zenekart and Korus of Guildford.
Based on its musical plans for the part of the city next year, he founded a wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
In principle, only 21-year-olds were allowed to belong to the singer, but when Proteus sang his final in 1979 - many of us were already at the end of our 20 years - we were simply not willing to buy the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological transformer) was consistent with the choir’s determination and ability to cope with any kott they put before – whether it was a piece of the madrigal or a Messiah; without adventure or an ambassador.
The musical versatility of such a young chorus was often incredible and always exciting, and we thanked the man whose enthusiasm for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often Tod told us, "Let the music speak from himself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
Everything's in the bag.
So sing it!”
His master’s technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or over-excessive.
Whatever the music level was, he always raised on it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If he had ever lived a driver who had to beat him as a knight, Vernon Handley was.
I met well in the two decades during which he led the Philharmonics of Guildford from 1962 to 1982.
In the past 40 years, I have written criticism about over 100 concerts, but never, no disappointment, and often appealed to them.
Tod Handley had the size and modesty, which is very rare.
He hated those leaders who, living with his words, were simply "three-two well-known battlers all over the world."
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to William Woodruff (born 25 September), he continued his economic history studies in Oxford in 1946, and in 1950 he became the scholarship of the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he was constantly prepared to obtain the basic degree, the master’s diploma and the PhD title.
It comes from the authorial notes of Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
From 1946 to 1953, he completed his PhD dissertation of the British tyre industry, which was then issued in 1958.
In 1950-51, he actually retired in the United States with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in summer 1952 at the University of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
You can't know why Woodruff made this time of career.
J. Vicente Resino
"J. Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Lifeṣ" is recommended because black-white, documentary-style photographs are impressive.
The simplicity and strength of them, as well as respect for the people on the photographs, have attracted my attention.
This exhibition can be seen by emotions.
Resino was able to inherit the magical moments."
Secondly, sale record at Honda
In November, Honda begins to distribute the second-generation Jazz.
It is true that your predecessor has already had enough passengers, but the development of the new model in the internal field is even more extensive.
All this is combined with a sophisticated mechanic that makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus Revolution.
This is how the second generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although it is very similar to the predecessor of the new Jazz, there have been a number of internal changes.
These include, for example, innovative design, new armor series, larger sizes and new mechanisms.
But before we switch to the detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the first generation was thrown into the market.
So, first of all, we can say that Honda has been able to renew this model in a shorter period than other manufacturers.
In Europe, Jazz is less known, but it decides to sell records on other markets.
Such a market, such as Japan, where in 2002 and this year, Jazz was the most sought car factory.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million pieces of Jazz have been sold on the market since they went to Japan.
The second market was the Old Continent with nearly half a million copies sold in six years.
However, Honda with the new Jazz would like to further increase traffic in the region.
In 2007, the Japanese company sold 83.000 Jazz, and by 2009, the estimates target 100,000 cars, leading to 17% growth in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda sold 8000 pieces of Jazzt on the Spanish market, this represents 6.7% of the total turnover of Honda in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the Spanish subsidiarity’s leaders will be counted by 2000 copies sold over a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly mitigate the loss of the traffic of Honda in Spain.
The company’s representatives predict 22,000 sold copies by the end of this year, which represents 4,000 less than the 2007 data, i.e. a reduction of 16%.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.8% last year.
By 2010, I would also like to increase this proportion to 2%.
Honda hopes that it can be achieved by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-door and compact size - 4370 mm long - hybrid, of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 pieces every year in the world.
According to the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight’s market distribution would be made by the United States, while the remaining proportion would be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight’s commercial introduction after the official valence show scheduled for January, which is due in the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become wider in all respects.
The length reaches 3900 mm (five centimeters), the width of 1690 mm (two cents wider) and the axle distance increased by 5 centits, i.e. 2500 mm.
The height is unchanged 1520 mm.
In addition to the sizes, the passenger space became wider.
On the one hand, the larger inner space is guaranteed by the new arm series, on the other hand by the medium fuel tank - this solution can be known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the so-called double floor - container has grown in full warehouse, currently 399 liters, i.e. 19 liters above its first generation capacity.
Although this includes the type of engine 1.4 of these sizes, Honda Jazz's container is 379 litres.
Some external changes can also be found, such as rear down lamps or selectable panorama glass ceiling, as well as easier access to rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors belonging to the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, compared to the opening angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second-generation Jazz engines are new.
At the beginning of its use, this small model can be ordered with two, 1.2 and 1.4 litres of engines.
Due to the i-VTEC technology, both resource consumption is more favourable than its previous model, as well as low carbon emissions and excellent mechanical coherence, while the engine has high performance in all respects.
The power of 1.2 litres is 90 horsepower at 6000 speeds, and the maximum torque of 114 Nm 4100.
This engine - which was 78 horsepowers in the previous Jazz - consumes 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The second engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
Jazz 100 horsepower 1.4 consumes on average 5.4 liters, and its emissions are 128 grams of CO2.
The collision of the "bee car"
To develop anti-accident technologies, Nissan has this time been inspiring a new invention from the world of bees.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that avoids accidents by chopping the bees.
The device called Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step to develop anti-coupling technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co.'s advanced Technical Centre built this small robot in Japan in cooperation with the advanced University of Tokyo in Science and Technology.
According to Kazuhhiro Doi, the Director of Technology PR and Research Development, BR23C is a further extension of Nissan's four-level security protection bucket.
The robot makes the company’s products more complete.
During the flight, every bee develops its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety protective cover.
However, it is much more important to play a role in the complex eyes of the bee, with which it sees in every direction in more than 300 degrees angles. Consequently, the bee can fly in an uncomfortable way in its own personal territory.
To copy the complex eye function, engineers designed a so-called laser telemeter (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument identifies the obstacles within a maximum of 2 metres of 180 degrees of view space before BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into an operation to avoid the impact.
As soon as the obstruction occurs, the small robot will immediately change the direction of the movement of the bee by moving the wheels in a smaller or larger angle to avoid the impact.
The system is most distinguished from the devices currently available, that the avoidable manoeuvre is fully automatic in this case.
If not, the robot would not respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the project’s chief engineer.
By way of derogation from the bees, the avoidable manoeuvre cannot be directed upwards or downwards, and shall not move through a diameter, only in two dimensions, and only in the direction of wheel rotation, i.e. not in an endless direction and in a manner that occurs in the case of bees.
That is why Nissan used a rotation function in the robot to avoid impacts in addition to acceleration and slowing.
“This structure only has to process the data every few seconds and respond to them.
There is no need to store data or intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres, so it can operate without interruption with only a few dozen KB memory.
It may sound surprising, but it’s not really a gigabyte, but we’re not even talking about megabyte-sized memories.
This is the first step to develop a technology for immediate collision prevention, which can be included in serial cars within ten years based on Nissan estimates.
Robot operates with lithium polymer batteries, which are easier and more durable than the lithium ion version.
In the future, the unit may be equipped with GPS satellite navigation system to bring the car to the end by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Department of Treasury has a lot of cash that can be invested, there is no sense of understanding.
Since the crisis is on their necks and that Americans do not have a questionable mortgage banking drivers, a fun and informative online game was created by the "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the "Ross Credits Hotel", that is, the Galiba.
The image of the accommodation and especially the reception cosmos suggests that we consider once again, twice, even three times, whether the time of borrowing has actually come.
And especially where we need a loan, because it is probably the purpose of this thing.
The information available on the website is really useful, but little detailed.
It's more for teenagers than for the public.
But what would happen if we supplement the game?
For example, the hotel would have a room for our dreams.
Actually, it's something because we're not dreaming of buying the apartment...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that he would have a share in his capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after the exchange rate of Morgan Stanley shares fell on the stock market.
After a week of publication of the pre-contractual agreement, the two banks said that MUFG purchases 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock shares at a unit price of $25.25, i.e. a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is left by more than 19% of the value of the securities according to the book of 31 August.
MUFG invests additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities that provide 10% yields and their exchange rate is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said that when the global transaction is carried out, the average exchange rate of $29 is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley’s stock exchange rate fell back at 17.79 per hour and closed at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to speed up its transformation into a bankholding company," explains John Mack, CEO of the US Group.
Morgan Stanley has approved the new status last week that can diversify its activities, while under the Federal Reserve control.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from the companies registered on Wall Street.
On Monday, the terms of the agreement have been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that his share 20% was sold to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought that the share would be entirely part of the stocks," Toshihide Mizuno, CEO of MUFG, explained.
"But because of the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimize and protect potential risks."
In view of the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the yield for one share will decrease by about 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG may convert half of its priority shares into stock shares in one year if the trading rate of the latter is more than 50% above the exchange rate for a specified period, i.e. about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that you can use funds from MUFG to make use of your investment opportunities, improve your balance and increase your liquidity resources.
However, the group spokesperson did not want to provide accurate information on the two new allies’ strategic plans.
After the MUFG merger, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I payout rate by about 15%, which will be one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan said that his balance has been improved since the end of August.
For the last few weeks, the group has been faced with a great challenge, as the exchange rate of its shares fell to half, until the cost of insurance against non-payment risk has fled into the skys.
This cost was moderated on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
One of the major investor banks remained “treatment” after buying Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. This Goldman Sachs, announced last week that he got $15 billion: some of it comes from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa Monday statement, Quito
Reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of socialism in the 21st century.
This is a common plan for Venezuela Hugo Chávez, Bolivia Evo Morales and Rafael Correa.
Following the sample of his presidents and friends, Correa explained his ideas about the new constitution on Sunday.
He successfully completed his mission, since 64% of voters voted yes in the referendum according to the official results of 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted with gender, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of their voters were unfulfilled.
The draft Constitution was adopted by 50% + 1 votes.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out in the field of the exit of the voting books and the accounts carried out by a civil society have proven the vast superiority of the "yes" votes with 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa has already spoken about the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday to Monday night.
"The Constitution has won a great victory," he announced, and thanks to the Ecuadorians in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest from Quito.
As well as the general public, Rafael Correa Chávez, Morales and Chairman of Chile, Michelle Bachelet also congratulated.
According to the report of the United States Observatory Mission (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. The main topic was a 444-point text that compiled the principles of "new socialism" protected by the President.
The proposed constitution sets the state power into the service of the economy and maintains the right to “development planning” for a country that is basically living in foreign companies’ oil extraction and the foreign exchange sent by migrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa elected in 2006 also strengthens the power of the Head of State who may receive mandates for up to two consecutive periods and is entitled to terminate the assembly.
Correa has already announced that he intends to live with this opportunity and will compete again in February 2009.
In the Constitution, the President has already started to introduce it in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population living under the minimum of existence.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which may end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuador facility for anti-drug measures under the U.S.
19 hostages were released in Chad
Egyptian Commander hit him on kidnappers who hostaged 11 tourists and eight of their ambassadors ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian ambassadors were held in the desert for ten days, where they were shipped to the capital of Egypt on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad during the morning by an Egyptian communal.
They appear to have arrived at the Al-Maza military base, which is directly linked to the Cairo International Airport at half four o’clock on the afternoon.
The hostages were forbidden to declare to the press and immediately moved to a hospital in the outskirts of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy", and the kidnappers were "not paid ransom" - said at the airport by Egyptian tourist minister Zoheir Garanna.
The hostages were captured on September 19th at the foot of the Ouana mountain in the border areas of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they took part in a landscape safarin. The group then hurried from one of the 35 unknown hostages to the other.
In the group there were 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and a Romanian women) and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and director of the Aptous Travel Office.
According to an Egyptian security manager, a 30-membered special commander arrived at two helicopters, where the hostages were hit directly before the power.
"There was a firefight between the teams. Half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest of them escaped," said the leader asking for his name to be silent.
He also said that 150 people were sent from the Egyptian Village Brigade to Sudan, where they were added to German and Italian commanders.
Italian diplomatic director Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
“We have to recognize that this result could not have been achieved without our professional and effective intervention of our secret service personnel and our teams,” he said, without further details.
He also refused to pay the ransom for the hostages.
Last day, the Sudanese Army announced that during the patrol, they arrested a terrain on which the kidnappers traveled. Six of them were killed (including the Chad leader) and two were arrested.
According to the Army, the hostage doors were connected to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the organization concerned immediately detained.
Lettres - "most of culture"
There is currently a debate on the financing of culture at the heart of newspapers and the current election campaign.
That's all we're happy for.
But one of our cultural lives is still forgotten.
Who will raise his word to illuminate the ridiculous amounts of small museums, letters, archaeological mines and national historical monuments on the edge of hunger death?
Which politician dares remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings that are part of cultural heritage?
Or do neither in Québec nor in Canada have laws that guarantee the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spent only three and a half million euros to restaurize the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
The Constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that heritage should be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Québec Association of Historical Societys, more than 40 000 volunteers are tired of researching history and preserving a large number of private archaeological and archaeological findings, with a minimum budget.
Often, these organizations protect our heritage with teeth circles and protest with the last power of the drowning, when real estate developers and decision-makers direct their bulldozers to our old buildings and forgotten funerals.
When will anyone stand for the protection of historic and cultural heritage?
The Bank of Fortis is renovated by the Benelux Governments
Benelux states contribute to partial nationalisation due to the overwhelming impact of the US credit market crisis, as the first European, in trouble at the Belgian-Holland bank, Fortison: three countries support a total of 11.2 billion euros of financial and insurance institutions with interest in Hungary.
At the highest level, the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch government discussed the matter at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission responsible for competition.
In the euro area, the Fortis bank is the first major crisis in the waves within the framework of the international financial market crisis for more than a year, so decisions made in the bank can be classified as precedent in some respects.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states purchase in nearly half (49%) of the bank’s existing ownership there.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including above all the activities purchased from ABN Amró last year.
Fortis’ shares have started to fall into a steep fall last week, and in the second half of the week there have already been serious crises at the institution.
However, the analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to allow them to go bankrupt.
The company's papers fell to a bottom of about 12 percent on Friday, 14 years old.
Since January, the value of shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
In view of current share prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to corporate managers, this is not real.
In other words, corporate management caused overseas market uncertainties related to the adoption of a $700 billion U.S. package plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have risen slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx appointed a new CEO to the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private customers, but no one has ever signed up with a worthwhile offer.
The Belgian government has already stated that investors do not need to be unhappy, they do not lose their money.
There has been no panic in the bank’s clients, and the accounts have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has its own account and also purchases leasing companies.
Horse in the Chicken Cock
In America, life and health insurers often refuse to enter into an insurance contract with the applicant on the basis of the drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals are afraid that the data market will become uncontrolled.
"There is a data protection programme that links the use of pharmacovigilance data in each case to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be independent in hand, otherwise we trust the fox of the chicken coat," quotes Richard Dick, the developer of the program to follow the prescriptions, the Washington Post.
Insurance companies will depend on the health status of the applicant customer and the amount associated with the insurance fee and the damages, and if they consider the risk too high, they will not be insurance with it.
In the past, the person was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the light of the outcome of the investigation.
Dick has been inventing a much cheaper procedure for ten years: on the basis of the customer’s identification number, he easily acquires what drugs he bought in the last half of the year, and the program itself concludes what disease he suffers and what his health condition is.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol, it suggests that your blood fat level is virtually untreated, which is immediately classified as a higher risk category.
There are also several versions of the program on the market, some also set a risk multiplication, so the insurance undertaking is hardly left to do without paperwork, although small difficulties are encountered.
The disadvantages are that some medicines can be used for multiple purposes, such as certain compounds can also be used against migraine or heat waves, which are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered to be a significant risk-enhancing factor for business insurance companies, not the former.
In order to request and process the data, there were separate companies, and they, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the patient's consent.
They are now obligated by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure.
Some companies are also processing the results of laboratory tests and also linked to drug consumption data, so they can provide a more accurate picture of patients’ health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and controlling the use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate health data protection law, but it covers only healthcare providers and insurance providers.
Before the Congress, there is a legislative proposal that gives authorities control over companies specializing in reporting.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough: he has therefore further developed its programme, which would involve the transmission of the data to its explicit consent.
Another question is that the person concerned may not refuse the contribution, otherwise the insurance undertakings do not enter into a contract with him.
So then the chickens are all referred to as the goodwill of the fox.
Global Marseille Dining Site
It doubles trade between the European Union and India
As mutually leading trade partners in the European Union and India, the 9th Summit has also ruled the agenda on this subject, in addition to the other, mostly global problems.
Today will also be the French-India summit, where it will be mainly about nuclear cooperation.
However, the European Union recognises that India is a rising democratic power that should be given a greater contribution to international issues, but the Member States have not yet been able to become a common nominator to support the permanent membership of Newdelhi in the UN Security Council.
This was not the case in Marseille last night and now at the 9th summit.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the President of the Union, and the President of José Manuel Barroso, and High Representative of Foreign Affairs, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Szingh, with whom they agreed to double in five years, i.e. increasing trade traffic by abundance of EUR 100 billion.
In view of the increase in trade between 2000 and 2007 from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious goal.
In this respect, the 20 bilateral civil aviation convention with India was legally assembled, i.e. air traffic can drive in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised that the consultation would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU’s first trade partner in India, Newdelhi is only in the ninth rank of EU partners.
The summit has devoted its attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, the latter were condemned in all forms and urged to bring together the UN Conference.
They also called for the conclusion of the Dohai trade round, although both of them have a large part of the failure.
The EU has confirmed that, in addition to its sustainable energy and climate programme, it would like to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agrees with this, as should be a global agreement at the forthcoming climate conference and reduce the production of greenhouse gases by 50% to 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and supported the summoning of the international meeting to review the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Governor is going to the French capital, where the bilateral meeting is about to deal with the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they trust that French companies will receive an order of €20 billion to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the news reports, the agreement would be for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers represent themselves with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmesse Fair.
This year’s Frankfurt International Booking Fair is waiting for 7000 exhibitors from 101 countries, in 171.790 square metres, where more than 403.000 books are presented. The decorative guest will be Turkey.
At the opening party of Italian Pavilon, the Italian Government is represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Culture Javas and Activities: Italy, by setting up a single Italian Pont, will take 264 square meters of exhibition area.
The celebratory opening will be followed by a press conference in the Buchmesse 5.0 Pavilion's "Room Struktur" hall, where it will also be an opportunity to describe the situation of the Italian book publishing, information, trends and views.
According to the data, the share of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is constantly reduced, especially in the area of adult and youth publications.
They found the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane missing one year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared over the Nevada desert on 3 September 2007.
It was found in a 3000 metres high ground in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and Nevada, near Mammoth Lakes.
Human remains were not found inside the plane.
John Anderson, Sheriff of Madera County, dismissed all the existing doubts: “We sent a team after finding the plane’s situation, and we can now be sure that it was the machine Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance,” he said at a press conference.
The Sheriff also confirmed that there were no human remains in the airplane or the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (NTSB) announced that a few hours after the discovery of the wreck, an investigative committee was asked to identify the machine and to establish that it was actually the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on 3 September 2007 on the day Fossed from Nevada Yerington to a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some personal belongings near Mammoth Lakes.
Two certificates for Fosset's name, issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Surveillance, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was filed one month after he disappeared.
The billionaire set up a number of summits to put himself in history.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the earth with a balloon: two weeks of lonely flights.
Three years later, he fled the land without landing.
There are also several records of the flight above Andok, at 15.445 metres of height, which he carried out with a second pilot.
GLK, Astonishing Advertising
An unusual, at the same time, with an original and definite form of hobbirep, large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is the latest Mercedes-Benz "compact terrain" with which the German car factory tried to bring fresh fluctuations to the market.
This is precisely because of the different content from the traditional, it will also be surprising and unusual for the launch campaign of the SUV GLK in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October.
For the advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle, it is a media-communication tool that has not been known until now, including through utopic 3D plaques, which the car mill has not yet been used in Italy.
The giant plakate action, consisting of three stages, will govern the central shopping street of Milan by 15 November, the Corso Como.
The first stage of this new type of media communication begins with the car's spatial effect, in which the new SUV, with special glasses shared in the area of Corso Como, will be visible in almost real sizes and in three-dimensional formats.
The photographer will feel like the car is pulling out of the poster.
After that, through innovative Lifemina8 technology, all the details of the new GLK becomes visible to form a single picture.
Obviously, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotype advertising world of the automotive industry with this promotion.
Can you get the interest of future customers? We'll see.
We also show who the Italian Football Huligans are
Triveneto young people, they're probably excluded from the tracks.
But who is this 150-200 boy and girl who is now ashamed of all Italy? Members of the group called Ultras Italy, who have been following the selection for years, and which, in truth, has not so far caused too much trouble.
They never hit the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is right.
The main organizers come from Trivento.
Also from Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udina.
These were joined by small groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact only a few units) in Sofia.
Italian flags were hanged on which the hometown of the cheerleaders was marked: on Saturday they were removed so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi fan team with the Levski Drugs.
The Italian Football Association provided 144 tickets to Italian fans. These were tickets for the name, so it was easier to check the Tourcolo team.
The Ministry of Interior has also verified everyone: there was no one to be involved in the process, no one to be banned from the stadium visit.
Four Italian sponsors who have a record of football were denied tickets and exits.
At the moment, the Ministry of Interior is waiting for protocols from the Capitol Police and then takes the necessary measures: those who have been arrested or identified during the disruptions can also be subject to a five-year ban.
This is an international ban, not only for the visit of all stadiums in Italy, but for all of Europe.
So our football huligans can't put their legs on a single football field.
Fortunately.
However, we need to be afraid that the Huligans will find followers, i.e. that it will be nearly fifty people, and that others will join.
"But you have to choke this fire, do not excuse anyone who acts like that," the Ministry of Interior said.
So it is better to keep our eyes open, especially as the Wednesday day of the contest is near in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the Observatory Service and on Tuesday, the Committee on Sports Events, which can also be counted on one of the departments of the Internal Security Service, are meeting.
"Duce-Duce scanning and accelerating arm under the Italian hymn?"
This thought was developed, in a rather unhappy way, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed to the front of the Ministry of Interior's Observatory (the post was reserved by Francesco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi) a few weeks ago.
Before that, Mazzilli was Chief of Police of Tries, the city where a cell that has been supporting the Ultras Italy Group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true is not forbidden to live Duce in Bulgaria, but it was still shameful for the 150-200 fans.
I am not a sociologist, adding to the first person of the observer service, but the crimes must be judged in the country where the crime was committed.
So far, this group has not caused any problems. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to keep it going.
But let's talk a little about the Italian anus: it's not a crime, but, if you can say that, it's not called a goodness."
