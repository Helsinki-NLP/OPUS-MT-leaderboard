Four members of the Kemerovo Group were held in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police in Spain arrested the so-called Kemerovo group leader in Estonia, Slava Gulevich, known as Slava Kemerovski in the criminal world.
Gulevich was arrested in Spain with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects in Estonia.
According to doubts, the so-called Kemerovo criminal community members of the age of 27-57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
The alleged leader of the criminal community was held in the province of Mala in Spain in Mijas.
Three men were arrested as suspects in Estonia, one of them has been collected according to a criminal community leader figure and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles of the criminal community were clearly allocated.
The aim of the criminal community’s activities was to commit drug crimes and thus earn criminal income,” commented the president of the pre-criminal proceedings, the prosecutor Vahur Verte.
“We do not preclude the increase in the circle of suspects in this criminal case,” the prosecutor added.
This is the case with people who have been in the interest of law enforcement agencies before, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that throughout the investigation, cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important.
“International cooperation has become normal for us and this week’s operation shows the success of cooperation,” commented prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said that the pre-examination of the arrests preceded nearly a year and a half.
“In the first half of the world, long-term work was realised and we held suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time,” he said.
He added that the Central Criminal Police officials were assisted in detention in Spain.
For years, we have a good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civil cards.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe,” said Leis.
The information collected so far indicates unanimously that the suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, so the prosecution requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
In the context of this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash have been arrested to ensure confiscation.
The prosecution of the criminal case shall be carried out by the Central Criminal Police Agency and shall be chaired by the state prosecution.
The City Court of Tallinn sentenced Slava Gulevich to extortion in 2005 and punished him with five years of imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered a second man in the criminal world after Nikola Tarankov, the submarine leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, emerged in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortions in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed tax drivers and prostitutes operating at different hotels and demanded monthly roof taxes from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal income and effective judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, the eight accused from the criminal community of the so-called Dikajev, from which the criminal income was confiscated by EUR 80 000, or the judgment of nine persons, in 2006, that Igor Aleynikov established a criminal community aimed at the illicit trade in and the execution of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Eastern Virginia and South Estonia.
The amount of confiscated criminal income is approximately 71 500 euros.
In these criminal matters, success has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, jointly take action in any EU country.
The Civil Rights Group warns for traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri for discriminating policies and racial attacks of the state.
The group's statement states: "The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri until 28 August 2017 calls on all African American travelers, visitors and missourists to be particularly careful and extremely cautious in the whole state, taking into account the whole race's bizarre race-based events that have recently been made across the state and here."
According to the NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning to both the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win discrimination cases, as well as the fact that the targets of state officials are in an unequal proportion of minorities.
Human rights are violated.
They're pulling the tea edge due to their skin color, beaten or killed," said the NAACP Missouri branch president Rod Chapel newspaper The Kansas City Star.
“We’ve never received so much complaints before.”
This is the first warning that the organization has issued for the US state.
The group referred to events such as racial insults in the direction of black students in Missouri University and the death of the 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died from the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he got out of the state and Missouri's police arrested without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the comment refers to the recent report drawn up by Missouri’s prosecutor, which shows that the cars of black drivers are suspended in the state by 75% more likely than those of white people.
“It is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends, and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared, whether it means the inclusion of the bail money or the information of relatives that they are going through the state.”
On the basis of the latest data from the FBI’s hate crimes, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, which put the number of similar violations in the state in the 16th section of the country.
Travel warning is also the answer to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to appeal to the company’s court for housing or job searches for discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU had previously issued travelmarks on Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws, which obligated the local ability to arrest people for immigration violations, as ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Usually, the Ministry of Travel provides warnings for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have started to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends in the US.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the various forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, may be caused by five different - A, B, C, D and E hepatitis virus.
All these viruses lead to acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, with a low cost of chronic hepatitis B and C, which can continue to develop into cirrhosis of the liver, i.e. choking of the liver and liver cancer.
The epidemiological adviser of the Health Board, Kuulo Kutsar, says that signs of acute hepatitis are similar in all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, grey faeces, dark urine, muscle and joint pain and yellow skin and mucous membranes.
The name of the liver inflammation is also derived from the last disease.
In children, hepatitis can occur without signs of disease.
Various types of liver inflammation can only be determined based on laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can go into chronic hepatitis for decades without signs of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his harmful liver disease.
Kuulo Kutsar brings out various hepatitis forms and describes their course more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us with contaminated food or water drinking, sexually, from infected person’s excretion to food, surfaces, objects, injuries and drug consumption.
The family members and guardians of the risk group of hepatitis A infection, people with chronic liver disease, people with infectious sex, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with high spread of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccinations, particularly in people travelling to a lot of hepatitis A risk group.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands before using food to wash all fruits and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, when injecting drugs, tattooing, augmenting, using blood contaminated human forests (hambacles, racing tools), donor blood, sex with a hepatitis patient, and hepatitis-infected mother to the foetus/antibodies.
The hepatitis B risk group includes drug addicts, sex partners of infected people, men who have sex with men, newborn mother, sick family members and guardians, health, rescue workers and police, and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, people can be vaccinated; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people within the risk group and, in addition to those with chronic liver diseases, HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and people with diabetes.
The other preventive measures of hepatitis B are: avoidance of the use of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharp devices and syringe needles, tattoo and augmentation, and use of condom in the case of infectious sex or avoid sexual risk management.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan and free of charge for children in Estonia.
Hepatitis C viruses spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, when injecting drugs, tattooing, augmenting, using blood contaminated human forests, donor blood, sexual sex with a hepatitis-campant person, and hepatitis-infected mother to foet/infection.
The risk group of hepatitis C infection includes drug addicts, sex partners of infected people, men who have sex with men, newborn mothers, sick family members and guardians, health workers, rescue workers and police who are exposed to blood and other body fluids, people with HIV infection, and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis C.
The prevention measure of hepatitis C is: avoidance of the use, tattoo and augmentation of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other steel equipment and syringe needles, and use of condom in the case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
hepatitis D causes hepatitis D virus that is multiplied in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
This is why hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis viruses spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringe needles, sexually transmitted and rarely infected mother to the foetus.
The risk group of hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
Effective preventive action is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with hepatitis D virus.
E hepatitis viruses are spread by fecal orally with drinking water and food, including in the eating of low-heated animal meat, fish and marine carrots, donor blood, jointly used syringes and infected mothers to the foetus.
Passengers may be infected with E hepatitis in high-infection countries.
E hepatitis prevention measures are to comply with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after walking in the toilet, before cooking and eating, after taking care of the patient.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated animal meat, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid the consumption of drugs.
While in the last round, the competitors tried to move a four-fold Olympic winner off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength and won at 26.49.51.
Farah didn’t think long, pulling her and her husband Tania and children along the road after the final.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on them was wonderful," Farah said to journalists.
Farah aims at the fifth title competition in London in a row of 5000 and 10,000 metres of gold dubbles.
Everything is possible if you believe it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor divings in gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's extraordinary story from the birth story of one art works to a much deeper from the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to the cultural life of Vienna.
But even more in-depth history.
It would have taken a harder scary amount of information, or a narrower theme would have allowed to get more impact on the extraordinary story in the title.
It would now be like two books between one cover: Gustav Klimt and his painting "Daam in gold", the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a more extensive and extensive history book of respected Jewish families and German occupation, along with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to a cultural life in the middle of Vienna, and who himself has arrived in the capital of Austria, can at least fail to imagine how more than a hundred years ago the life was around the Ringstras or how all the heads in Central Cafe turned when Klimt entered.
In one of Europe’s richest cities, the focus of cultural figures was a high name, and in the book, you feel more like a gram of culture.
However, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where the untreated syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if it did not give anything more to development.
Or perhaps, every pair-speaking pinch will add colors to the cultural life of the 20th century in Vienna.
A dream of traveling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna has grown explosively, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
In the century, every ten of Vienna’s inhabitants were Jewish.
Adele’s parents were newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married her two times to the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt for his famous paintings, her father’s bank had already become the seventh bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But the whole glamourous life in which he belonged did not pull.
When you look at "Dam in Gold", it is hard to believe that the end of life this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband's portrait from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
The order for Klimt paid 4000 kroons at that time, a quarter of a good location from the price of the country house.
The fact that some of the portraits were suspected of the master’s love story with a model, the sugar magnet did not deteriorate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist developed during the work continued for the rest of the life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Daam Golden.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait," Varrak 2016, Translated by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the beginning of the work with Adele, Klimt had visited Ravennas San Vita, and researchers believe that the glorious mosaics that were just seen there gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of the mosaic painted from Adele.
Klimt presented his "Dama's gold" in Vienna in 1908 and about at the same time (in 1907-1908), another golden land was born in the "Sudlus".
The artists did not miss the similarity of two women.
What about Hitler?
"I think I owe him to make his handwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after leaving the artist (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family Climt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before the death of Klimt had made another portrait of Adele.
In his will (Adele in February 1925), he also asked his husband to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes to Austrian Gallery.
His jewelry was inherited to his nephews Mary and Luise.
A year after Klimt had finished "Austria Mona Lisa", he had tried to get to the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but fell through the drawing.
Although Hitler’s later antisemitism is sometimes considered the reason that the Jewish professors did not accept him in the Academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the Austrian Galerii task mentioned in the Maria Testament had changed significantly by 1939 - it had become important for Vienna’s rich Jewish art collections to find delightful works for the Nazi parties.
Hitler’s personal art property was also suitable for some of the jobs at home, but not Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year trial began between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs.
In this case, it should be noted that when the "Suudlus" is seen in the Vienna Belvedere Castle, Adele Bloch-Bauer's Gold of Dam must be watched to travel to the New York Neu Gallery.
And before the Vienna ride, you can also read the book mentioned above.
Even if you’re going to watch Climt’s work, because at least my emotions rolled around more Nazi and Jewish subjects after closing the book than $ 135 million sold painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
Therefore, not as portrait as a family destiny story - and a very moving story.
In the beginning of the book, the Bauerian family tree facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
Gold was very close to his own 200-metre serial swimming personal record swimming at 2.16.62.
Tippmark comes from a 17-year-old bike from the back of a week, when the Canadian Junior Championships took place at 2.16.58, Priit Aaviku Swimming Block is mediated by the Priit Aaviku Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last to get to the A-final.
In the final, he passed a distance from 2.15.76 and reached a great seventh place with a new powerful brand.
Alina Kendzior’s Estonian record (2.15.13) left Gold a little over half a second.
Gold grew third in all times of Estonia and its fresh personal topmark is the fifth result of all times in Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still starting 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in the Canadian adult championship and 200 m and 400 m in the complexity.
Last week, it took place in Toronto at the Canadian junior championships, and Gold made a successful start there too.
He won 200 metres of freezing with silver medal at 2.03.22.
This was so quickly swimed by the frontier of the distance in 2008.
In Estonia, this distance is swiming faster than the Estonian recording lady Elina Partõka.
The ancestors living in Canada won a pronx medal of 100 m free time with a great personal record and a new Estonian season of excellence 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than him, has swimdled this distance by only one century faster.
To the top of the individual, he reached a letter of 1.03.69 when he was swiming around 100 meters.
In half the distance, he only reached the seventh place when he swim at the end of 2.17.31.
Gold is currently in the leadership of the Estonian season in four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpening teeth
It's time for holidays - it means relaxation to President Donald Trump.
Since Trump has been one of the most recent holidays, critics are already strangling the teeth.
According to US Today and CNN, the president's 17-day holiday is scheduled to be at a so-called golf club in Bedminster, located in New Jersey.
Although the president’s holiday began yesterday, Trump’s opponents have spoken about holidays for a week.
They're throwing too much rest on Trump.
In other words, the president is used to spend weekends in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
In other words, Trump has not been the most relaxed president in his 196 days of office.
For example, George W. Bush had 67 days on this holiday, but Barack Obama was half less than Trump, only 21 days.
Trump’s things are getting a little bit more unforgettable.
The counted days after becoming president, Trump said "60 minutes" that there would be no time for long holidays within his agent, because much needs to be done.
Three years ago he also expressed a disgrace for Barack Obama’s holiday.
The current president wrote on Twitter: “When Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to party and jazz concerts, ISIS is cutting the sun off.”
According to the White House officials, the 17-day golf club is not exactly a relaxation.
It is officially called a leave of work during which Trump has no time for reading or other attractions.
In addition, there was another reason for the leave of work.
In the west wing of the White House, the conditioning system is replaced and the entire staff had to leave.
Ovaalkabinet and other presidential offices are also located in the western wing.
“I don’t think any of you would like to be in the west wing in August if there were 38 degrees and there is no conditioning,” said Lindsay Walters, spokesman of the White House, who stressed that the president would continue to work during the holiday.
From where President Trump spends 17 days, you'll find out about the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not apply to the state authority if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew so much about the negative media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers didn’t take long to start smashing him for everything from internal policy to political principles.
Critics, of course, irritated him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that freedom of expression could be taken away from us, and in dark and silent, we could be guided in sheep’s way to slaughter.
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to be more than Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted at least 450 posts who published their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And in the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought him to court.
The governor's officials made the action empty, and the web commentariums coupled the counter-reactions in the style "Is it interesting?".
“It’s just Facebook,” many said.
But it counts.
And it counts very much when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular Republican governor in the overweight democratic state.
The percentage of his approval is better than one of the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a responsive snackhead.
He has led the state with a certain hand and remained strictly determined by his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool in communicating with his electorals, showing, for example, the first time after chemotherapy, a lazy head.
Therefore, the governor’s page, which is a public forum with official marking, which is managed by the blocking of people who are hiring from taxpayers’ dollars, is inadmissible and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan press spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the conduct of the Governor’s interview to the Washington Post, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing but moderation.
But it is too easy to paint a picture of online trains, trash mailers or anger full of people.
The Post talked to several real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's what they're real people who communicate with their chosen leaders. Teacher, company owner and pastor, not onlinerolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not inferior.
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post by pressureing on the Catholicity of Hogan.
A lawyer from Bowie from Maryland, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani did not inspire anger, but a real hate crime.
“I have politely commented that I am disappointed because he has not responded to anger crimes or other recent news,” he wrote in the commentary.
“I don’t like the idea that if a lot of people comment on the same subject, some call it indifferently collective effort instead of admitting that it is a huge number of concerns with citizens.”
What the governor's official called "directed spam attack" would probably be called "public support".
Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking the critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it used to be when workers were sent out to collect and burn or arrest the journals with critical guides and force them to silence.
This is what is happening now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official criticized by making Facebook and other social media channels bite.
President Trump has brought Twitter users to court who are blocked from the Twitter stream.
One of the first judgments of the meaning of this matter were taken last week in Virginia.
In Alexandria, the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacher, decided that the chairman of the Loudoun County Supervisory Board violated the first correction of the Constitution when he blocked the electorate on his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited ACLU after using Facebook and Twitter, Governor Matt Bevin (R).
It shouldn't be so hard.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had similar effects as the Internet.
In the range 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers chased his way of management.
Even then, Washington had to chest with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington’s decisions to land.
According to historic documents collected in the framework of the Web-based George Washington letter collection project, he was buried under the petitions of the office, which criticised his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't make them shut up.
Freedom of speech, special opinions and discussions are the foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty expects the comfort of the home area at Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty, in the next three days, hopes for the comfort of the home territory when the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses take place in the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
The North Irish, who was on the Archerfield Links tracks in the neighbourhood last year prior to the recession of Paul Eales, has been engaged in a new event and performs the role of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad instead of the tournament ambassador.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and now we see the club shining with this event in full glory," Rafferty said.
“The travelers see the path in their best form, it is in a glorious condition.
Jerry has done a great job to build this place.
He is an enthusiastic supporter of the golf game and feels proud of what has been achieved here.
This enables the track to be a great presentation.”
An English Eales expects it to protect the championship for the first time, although the man has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It's going to be a very special feeling," said the player who was washing in Southport.
“I couldn’t protect my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off from my winning calendar a year later.
It's magical to come back to this place.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, the win last year was special.
It was a very special time that we will always wear in our hearts.”
On the ground of the homeland, Gary Orr will also return to the competition, who joined the European tour of the seniors in the beginning of the year when he got 50.
This is his first event in Scotland after the participation of Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“Home play is always a bit more meaningful,” Helensburgh’s man Orr said.
“You want to play well, but you’re also feeling extra voltage.
I've been playing again with a immense pleasure and a fairly decent golf game.
I am happy with the progress of things.”
Trio is joined by the former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and the Champions of Senior Tours Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cartoon Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scotlands in the competition, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge and the parking of the car will cost 5 pounds for a single passenger car and 10 pounds for two or more passengers.
All revenues go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death Indonesian Golden Green Land
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, he doesn't use a pill.
He doesn't even use the pot.
In Enarotal, a wooden house located in the capital of the Papua province of Indonesia, a homemade batate called nota in local language is placed directly on the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charged mushroom is removed from the fire and stirred with unwashed hands intensive skin.
Degei sits on the mud floor with no furniture and also does his daily household work, for example, washing with cloudy water from the nearby sex.
The role of the gym fills in the room without a roof.
Since he is the youngest of his husband’s four women, he is not appointed to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common in this country.
However, late working can be dangerous most of the village’s men are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
“No one dares to visit after five nights,” he says.
It is a rare look into life in the Papua Mountains. It is a former Dutch colony, which was added to Indonesia in 1969 after the no-emika of which only 1026 old people were forced to vote in the eyes of the occupied forces.
The movement of the Dutch supreme power towards its rage against the Jakarta government, which still keeps the region under strong control by keeping away from foreign journalists and human rights guards.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and the Western Papua, so the eastern part of the island remained to the independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is also a distant and abandoned place. To get here, a five-hour journey from Jayapur to Nabire is required to fly from the capital of the province 90 minutes and then through Nabire.
There is no public transport.
Around 19 000 inhabitants of the city consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wave iron roofs, which have been transformed by rusts to different shades of yellow browns.
Very few individuals have made the journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have almost any foreigner been here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the pope of Mee Pago worshiped God named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
“We hadn’t used to wear such clothes,” Degei said, referring to its colorful hand-drawn turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"Even before we wore only plant leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty border, and the statistics on the mortality and literacy of infants are one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also a golden land in Indonesia.
Only 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of around 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, is the world’s largest and most profitable gold mine Grasberg, which belongs to the Freeport McMoran company in Phoenix.
In 2015, Freeport alone extracted gold and copper from around 3.5 billion US dollars.
In addition, Papua can be proud of consumer wood stocks, which are estimated to be 78 billion U.S. dollars.
However, these wealths are the source of the Pope’s suffering, because they make the powerful presence of the Indonesian army.
The New York Times study in 2005 showed that Freeport paid approximately $20 million to local military and military units from 1998 to 2004, including $150 000 for one officer.
The efforts of the Paputes to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden shark and are mercilessly circumvented.
According to human rights activists, over 500 000 pope have been killed since 1969 and thousands of others have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by Indonesian armies.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killing in the mountainous countries of the Papua tribes in the 1970s was a genocide measure.
Last year alone, over 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested in the Indonesian police area.
The 2016 report of Birsbane's Archbishop "We Lose All" contains evidence of the cruelties committed in the previous year, such as out-of-court executions, torture (a second report suggests particularly common rape and electric shocks) and the cruel depression of peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of victims is difficult to read, because such incidents are taking place every week," says researcher Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
The screws have been tightened even more, as Papua’s natural resources have caused the inflow of new residents from other Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but demographics are changing, as Muslims from the population of Indonesia, Japan, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes are coming from Muslim economic migrants.
Jaavalainen family meals sell gaddo-gado with crustaceans and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals cannot compete with them.
"The migrants began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local pope," explains Pania, born 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to Jayapura for work.
"The priests of the petite soles of the pope's mama's will lose their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised in the 2014 electoral campaign to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won on his way to Jakarta’s presidential palace in the 29 electoral circles of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed and locals feel disappointed.
“Our hearts have been broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokow to expect that he will fulfill our hopes regarding the restoration of justice,” says You.
In fact, Paniai was only two months after Jokow’s office in the low.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotalis sang Christmas songs at the end of the fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle.
The children who met told them that they should turn on the front lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers insulted their voices and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, drunk soldiers pursued children and beat them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot in the children.
A 16-year-old Yulian Yeimot was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Election Committee building was set to burn and the next day things were further escalated.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children were gathered to demand justice to the football field in front of the local police department and military management centre.
They carried ceremonial hunting buses and presented the wait-tance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe, during which they ran around and matched the bird song.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police and military.
In the event of an aggravation, soldiers were sent through an internal radio. “If the mass is more than three times resistant, let them down,” according to the official document that has been seen by the magazine TIME, but which has not been issued to local media publications.
The senior Yeremian in Kego Koto city of Enarotal (56) felt a threat and called for peace, asking the crowd to go home.
No one had to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told the magazine TIME in his bright colors on the veranda of the wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the rows of the gathered soldiers.
“There was a lot of money, a lot of shooting,” he added.
The local man Alfius Youw was shot three times after his shooting.
"I ran to him and studied him through his body to make sure that he was with him," said TIME in the synthesis Yohanes, who uses only one name in the way of many indonesians.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told the reporters that he would only be subject to his return only to the security of his department because it was attacked.
“We need to protect ourselves when we are threatened to kill us,” said Papua Police Press Officer Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and were abundantly injured.
The news of killings came to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapuras had a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy to the families of the victims and promised to deal with abuses in Papua.
“I want to solve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said that it would establish a non-judicial mechanism to solve crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately there were apologies.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
On June 5, Jakartas, speaking with TIME, Wiranto returned his words, saying that he has no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything is solved according to the law."
Wiranto, accused of crimes against human rights involving more than 1000 deaths in Eastern Timor during the 1999 verical Independence Reference, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania accepted such claims with a disgust.
“I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress,” Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives fearful years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed that Paniai’s people are afraid to dissolve this incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bury four victims.
“The army came to search for me from the funeral of the bodies,” he said.
Shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired villagers in the Neighbourhood of Pania in Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when he went into war between the villagers and the manager of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
The 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned fishing for the nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing off the police with stones that the latter responded with warning shots.
However, according to the local authorities, the mobile brigade (indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in great panic, fearing revenge," said TIME 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured entry.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiyai Parliament has called for the responsibility of the police involved and the police to withdraw the mobile brigade from the region.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds the discomfort of the tribes of honey, multi, dani, and damali.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) Army of the Rebels, which, according to it, protects the rights of the Pope by organizing incidental attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the Army's pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the state has been arrested in Pania over the last few years and seized thousands of people voluntarily.
Some of them will never appear again.
Papua is known as a "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds unsatisfactory.
A few rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive to buy for locals.
The bread is equally unacceptable.
People grow all their foods themselves mainly in batate, in addition to a little fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is women’s work, each of whom can care for four or five bats.
They usually keep most of the crops for the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten batteries only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have deepened between indigenous popees and new migrants who have arrived in the new routes of the Nabire airport since the opening of the new routes.
These few jobs that exist are better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua themselves often lacks capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
“Young people are not interested in staying, because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, Chairman of the Council of the Paniai tribes.
The separation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition to external media, strict restrictions remain.
In the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out of Papua because "they did not follow appropriate practices", although they were given a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, Vice-President of the Human Rights Watch Asian Department, Jokow's electoral promises have not been implemented to eliminate restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development.
"Indonesia, the new threats of rejecting the visa and carrying on a black list are threatened by journalists trying to report in the eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua," he said.
The lack of a poring look in the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries were encouraged to investigate “the many wide-ranging crimes” in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
The same countries have historic support for VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs press spokesman, dismissed the allegations of the group, saying to the journalists Jakartas: "Indonesia still holds a democratic regime and freedom of the press, so evidence of human rights cases would be difficult to bury."
Local people want more foreign governments to be observed.
When the Dutch official delegation visited Jayapura, Keis Van Bar on 4 May, the local people interrupted the meeting, but according to the source who wanted to remain anonymous, asking for their silence, “We want freedom.”
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the pope do not believe they will vote again for Jokow.
“Jokowi is a good man with intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai shooting,” says Hobai, Chairman of the tribes.
He wants to understand to Jokow that, in addition to the fact that the people of Pania live constantly under the threat of the predatory army, they are struggling because of the misery of nigel education and health services.
According to Gobai, Paniai’s people, like other pope, consider their voice to be a debt to Jokow.
“They don’t need money, they want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and threats, the families of the Paniai shooting victims managed the last sympathy they buried one of the dead bodies in a country against the police department and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on foot, at least they will not let the defendants forget their crimes.
“One of our family members were killed,” Yacobus said.
"What else can we do?"
Dubai Torch's cloud-breaker came in for the second time.
On Friday, he drove through one of the world’s highest residential towers in Dubai, forced hundreds of people to escape from this 337 metres height and 79-store building.
This is the second fire that has been devastated in just two years by a high building called Torch or Torch tower.
The building was evacuated, no injury was reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
“We slept and woke up on firearms and screaming people.
We drove down the stairs, and we took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters was a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai civil defense officials, firefighters erased the fire at about 4:00 in the morning at local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working for the victims of shelter.
This incident may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outside surface of high buildings worldwide.
In the 2015 investigation conducted after the fire of the Bureau of Torch, the most damage suffered by the facade cover - the decorative panels and insulation of the external surface.
The British police have said they believe that the insulation of the London Grenfell Tower and facade panels could contribute to the rapid spread of fire in June, where about 80 people died.
See: these phones will probably be sales buildings in the autumn.
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for technical fans, as phone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
In spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were sold, too, in the autumn, there are new hit phones for poets.
According to Tele2 Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Seema, today’s flagships are characterized by an innovative design, an eyewitness scanner, a 4K resolution screen and a high-speed processor.
In the technology world, Samsung Galaxy S8 has created great excitement, which has also reached the front page of the Estonian smartphones.
In autumn, smart people are allowed to avoid more fast loading, more durable battery, more high-quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that, on the basis of the hearings, you can already make assumptions and predict four top models that probably capture the sales presentation tables of this year.
These four top smartphone models will be available to poets in the autumn of this year.
Long-term iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach poets in mid-September.
The rumors that the new Apple model looks like and what you can do with it spread a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to vary completely from previous models.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire phone’s front panel, lost on the home button and the fingerprint reader is built on the screen.
Apple's designer JonyIve requires a new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There is also a ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the eyelash scanner, wireless loading and even more high-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
It is certainly one year expecting smartphones.
The pre-telling of the uhiuue model Galaxy Note 8 begins on 23 August.
There are a lot of reports that the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is reported to be more designed for a business user and S Pen allows for even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which has a wider width and the other TV object with a narrower field.
At present, no one else knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, it is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8 for quality.
We are looking forward to the 23th of August.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones in front of Nokia 6 this year, there is still no flagship - Nokia 8, which is already presented on 16 August.
We look forward to Nokia's 5,3 inch to the edge of the screen and high-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also a talk about aluminum housing and a significant level of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras produced by the company Zeiss.
If Sony’s secure flagship has been XZ Premium until now, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future, with even more innovative functions.
We wait for a smartphone, which is a little more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
Sony’s new model is speculated that its screen is at least six-inch.
What reality brings, we can see right soon, because, traditionally, Sony has released his autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place this year until 1-6 September.
Trump pressured Mexico for payment of the border wall, according to the transkripts that had leaked the phone calls
The Washington Post released the transkriptions between the President Donald Trump and the heads of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, Trump called the Mexican president Enrique Pena Nietole to stop publicly proclaiming that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of America broke the wall with him for public condemnation, saying, "You can't tell the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign to build a southern wall of the United States and swore that Mexico would pay for this project.
Transkriptes were also published from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals a tense debate.
Trump told Turnbulli that the agreement that the United States would take over the refugees who go to Australia would be "nasty", "nasty" and "rumal". He claimed that the agreement, which was made during Obama's government, would leave him an impression of "juhmard" because he has offered refugees a ban on resettlement in the United States.
Trump finished the call by informing Turnbull that “the doing was the most unpleasant speech of the day.”
The Court did not discuss the complaint of OÜ MRP City Lines in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer for bus transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is an order to reject the OÜ MRP City Lines offer at the bus contract in Tartu, since the offer did not comply with the requirements, Anneli Apuhtin, director of the City Law Service of Tartu, explained.
This is the procurement of public bus services within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The links of the MRP City appealed to the Riigi Court of the District Court of Tartu.
The Supreme Court did not take that action.
Although many in social media complain that the noise from the Weekend festival disrupts their night and the whole city is full of drunken parties, there are many people who don’t have any bad words to say about the festival on the beach.
I’m even very surprised that the store was so polite!
I didn't see any illusion or rudeness.
I even saw love," says the league.
“It’s nice to come, be and feel joy from Pärnu, which is winter as left in winter,” he adds.
The stubborn wave from the beach doesn't bother.
When he heard music in the beach when he lived in the city centre, music has not yet reached his home intent.
"But I hope to hear you," he said gladly.
Agnes, who talked about the evening page, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu, is a good contribution to local traders.
He also rejoices that the summer capital has come to visit so many foreigners.
The feast noise doesn't interfere with the woman.
All right, I'm not on the beach anymore, but it's nice that the beach is alive.
And it's nice that the people move and it's been three times," says the woman.
It was probably a little worse for the first time.
“There may have been complaints,” he thinks.
However, the noise in the beach says it is common for the summer peasants.
"This Weekend is a very good promotion for our small city," says Harri, who is peeled in the park.
The noise and the noise have not smashed his rhythm.
What's up?!
We should keep it all together.
Think about how this international communication would be better.
There's no loud music man.
It doesn't bother, though I live near the same place.
"Good people can hold together and have no trouble," he says.
The guests who come to Pärnu say they are polite.
“Of course, they have exaggerated a little, but young people are young and God-- let go, but be human and we can do it!” he says.
By then, the coastal residents have traveled away to some place, whether to see relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival is positively influenced by people who like such noise," said Tiina walking with children in Pärnus.
Even his family’s sleep in the festival music is not disturbed, although in the past year it came even further than this year.
Last summer, the stage was different, then we heard more.
We live out of the city, that it actually goes far to the Pärnu River quite well,” he says.
Pearson cuts another 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to restore business
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that he cuts another 3000 jobs and reduces his intermediaries by 72%, launching another restructuring programme to solve business threats.
Lost jobs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, are highly likely to be concentrated at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, will be added to 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May the plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (394 million U.S. dollars) to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company that agreed to sell a holding in Penguin Random House to his partner company Bertelsmann last month said that their expectations in relation to the year have not changed since the 1 percent increase in sales revenue was reported in the first half of the year of £2.05 billion.

Convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide attack
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul, killing one of the NATO soldiers and wounding several of the others.
In the NATO statement, five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unauthorised local notifications, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the Qarabagh district of the city.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence caught in Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in the mosque attack in Herati.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Embassy of Iraq in Kabul.
The NATO statement said that Thursday night explosion took place when a joint patrol with the Afghanistan Army was attacked with "human-born explosives".
According to the statement, everything is injured in a stable state and treated in the US Military Hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the Correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) are a serious source of concern for the forces in Karabagh in NATO Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Chite region in Kabul.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a major bombing attack killed more than 150 people in the city centre - it has been the most killed by a military attack in the country since the US-led forces rejected the Taliban in 2001.
This violence underlines the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US military and police armies.
According to the Correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul have led to public confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPA annulled the decision to postpone the order after the action
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revoked the decision to delay the adoption of a Obama-time regulation which obliges the States to limit the emissions caused by the rods, one day after the 15 States complained to the Court of Justice due to this movement.
The EPA announced the decision to continue with the ‘2015 Ozone Level determination activities’ on Wednesday, saying that it demonstrates the commitment of the Agency to cooperation with the States.
“We believe that we need to dialogue and listen to partners from our states,” said Scott Pruitt, EPA leader.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to reject the determinations of ozone content in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced by one year to October 2018.
15 mainly democratic states brought action together with the Columbia district on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations established by former President Barack Obama. Trump says this is part of a broader economic growth plan.
However, these efforts have caused counter-reactions among democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about increasing the impact of pollutants on human health.
It is stated on the EPA website that the inhalation of ozone-containing air can "decrease the working capacity of the lungs and increase the risk of getting sick to respiratory diseases", such as as asthma.
The German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and beef may come to a party, as strong rain threatens the yield of the second wheat producer of the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year, the sagging of weeks before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is suitable only for animal feed.
"The quality of the wheat is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeisen's analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can go into animal feed, which is double compared to the usual, predicted in Agravis.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have faced all kinds of weather this year.
First, winter was too dry.
Then came a cold spring that was replaced by a hot wave in June.
In July, the Germans hit the rainfalls that have continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to North Germany, where the rain prevents harvesting.
Only five percent of wheat have been cleaned.
Most areas have not yet started harvesting, the local harvester reported in Ceravis.
"It's quite difficult days," said Ceravis's senior dealer Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, or Finnish interior designs
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the messiah homes, because through large windows, the excellent views of the Saimaa fish are reached in many (life) rooms.
At all stages, our northern neighbours are looking to create both hard and perfect (energy-efficient) homes.
The ability to use Finnish wood as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty is also worthy of the imminent and follow-up.
Incredible methods and smart solutions are found in the messiards by both the builder and the designer of the home.
It is evident that black, white and grey shade compositions, if they are additional wooden towers and rooms, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked for another week, as the fair lasts until August 13.
The needles and potatoes suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
Overnight, the line was drawn down to the Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix gave himself everything to remember as the last performer.
The people were in a real turn during Garrix's performance - singed, sighed, danced self-respectively.
When Garrix ended, a common mass of Pärnu was dispersed from the beach to the city.
We will bring you a gallery with all the photos that our photographer tried in three days on Weekend.
You must have some of them, too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing possible contradiction
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at a collision rate to go to the most confronting boxing category of up to 66.7 kg of weight in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were at the ESPN office in separate rooms in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council lightweight champ, walking on the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's closed weight champ.
After Garcia’s unanimous decision, the winner of the former four-fold World Championship Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters belong to the premiere of the weighted table.
Garcia handed his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck.”
Lomachenko protects his belts against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
When a couple posed for photographs, Lomachenko’s manager, Egis Klimas, said that there would be a "full Dimensions" between fighters.
"I'm formerly closed," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up to 63.5 kg for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to move down to the lightweight.
And he has to move upwards of lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have wanted it.
Let's offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The Pox world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be payable. This is part of his strategy that he wants Lomachenkol to debut at the end of this year in the 61.2 kg class to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37.7-0.0, 30 noots), who is also interested in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbelli winners after their 23 September title line.
“It could be worth watching this fight because fans have wanted this contradiction,” Garcia said, later saying that he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the main authors.
No other name can get so much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said she thought Lomachenko was a "powerful fighter" and could go see her Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest when he praised Garcia, saying that in his view, the three divisions of Riverside had seen "very slow; I'm sorry, Mikey... you wished to do that.
Garcia said it was designed to show impact strength and then fight.
Both confirmed that they felt the excitement of forces between them.
“It’s a struggle that awaits realisation.
No other opponent gives so much attention and suspicion.
I'm more than ready to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is just that.
This will be a good fight.”
From which corners of the world are moved to Estonia?
The Police and Border Guard (PPA) enlarged and issued records more than 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mainly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, if a temporary residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreigners, the number of tuna bubbles was 4928.
The authorities can’t tell how many migrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, the number of Ukrainians begins to reach close to 2000 in recent years.
The number of residence permit applicants increased rapidly during the Ukraine crisis - in 2014, 1087 people received a fixed-term residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to statistics, the number of Ukraine’s citizens in Estonia is increasing - more than 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia.
“The Ukraine community has been large in Estonia all the time, and due to difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that the opportunities for work and learning are sought from a country where the community and many of the family are already ahead of the family,” said Kristin Rammus, the press spokesman of the Ministry of Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who had been authorised to live in the country and the tuna was higher than the number of Russian citizens, although the most timely residence permits have been issued for the last few years.
If the Ukrainians come here to work, the Russian citizens will be in charge of the family.
"With this historic Russian community, they are likely to have the biggest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing.
“If you look at where Russian citizens who have been admitted to residence in Estonia have moved to life, then after Harjumaa, it has immediately been Eastern Virumaa,” she added, and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
In 1696, the country received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number of Russian citizens.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wished to extend their residence permit decreased.
"The problem is that instead of extending the residence permit has been applied for a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia," Rammus, the press spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, who said the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia's residence permit has remained stable for years.
A new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia can be applied for by foreigners who have lived here for at least three years since the previous year.
Its aim is to encourage adapted people to stay here.
However, a long-term resident’s residence permit requires five years, for example.
As a result of a new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit is also likely to have decreased.
For example, such a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
The Ukrainians are now able to change their work and the Estonian state will no longer be pushing a tip on whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit became popular - applicants are still grey passport owners (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people received a residence permit for residence in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and as many Chinese people.
In the first semester of this year, the total number of such applicants has already been 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, soil was 200.
Nigeria is going to study in these universities.
Moreover, Estonian higher education schools are popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turkish.
The number of people in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen predominantly thanks to the curriculum.
It also applies the rule that where the community has emerged, it will be easier to add to others,” Rammus added.
In ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much as Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If an annual residence permit is available to around 6,000 third country nationals, it is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if you consider more citizens of the European Union, migration remains about a percentage,” Maasing commented that the numbers are actually small.
According to statistics, 14 822 people travelled to Estonia, but 13 792 of them.
This means that immigration crossed the second year of migration.
Most foreigners and immigrants are Estonian citizens, but more are amongst the departers.
As a result, the Estonian citizens’ migrationaldo landed with 2,000 people at a minus.
In particular, the Estonians migrate the difference between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's Princess Modo charms with sacks, twins and bulls
However, the history of Maria Tammeoru has been in a thorough time of ideas - old paintings and costumes: "I took hours to dream somewhere in the museum and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
If you do something with a passion, you will study and learn about it every day.
It's a discovery pleasure!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may appear to some of the aliens, but the designer does not think so.
You decide how much shine is in your life!
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of the dresses of my created haute couture.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go on a red carpet every day, he wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and wear them!
You can live your own life as a special!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between bright events and grey everyday.
This was the idea that made a more rolling plan to bring the high-end to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people to whom the fashion often does not reach.
For example, the collection of Mammu was presented in Võrus, Jõhvis and Pärnu, where the Royal Defilee with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, there are often more emotions in the shop, they are swept up, they want to thank you on their hands.
A lot of the audience had to be news, but now they are the fans of Mammu Couture.
If you cross people's expectations, they're excited!
And I like the feeling that I'm in my fashion as if I'm in summertime.
We had 50 metres long red carpet, full of beautiful dresses in the street, and it seemed they didn't come to the end!
Maria does not recognize the fashionable fact that the creation must be presented by a supermarket supermodel, she will be delighted to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my customers to the stage - they have always been happy.
This is such a wonderful experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my show, I'm always behind the stage to give the last bucket of things as hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves would not allow you to look at the hall.
Maria is the kind of moderator who wants not only to play a representation role but to be inside everything.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, most of the collections I do myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far away from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
It is not limited to design, including stylists, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything has to fit away one temperamental woman's day.
These work hours are still huge in fanatics.
I can't tell you when my workday ends, for me it's just a full day of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an unstable happiness: I'm doing something beautiful, a man gets something beautiful and yet compliments.
How many times have been said that my dresses have magic - they make you feel like a princess.
Mammu Couture has remained a signature for today.
Martin Muürsepp U18 of boys: the Estonian subgroup tour weapon was turned against us now
Sorry, the fairy tale ended.
The first thing we saw was that we couldn't get our table.
And if there's such a big difference in the table, there's nothing to do," said Estonia's U18 basketball boys 61:75 left for the UK, the only basketball player who played in our NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant trainer Martin Müürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attack board and received so much more attacks.
We were not prepared for their aggressive protection or attack, it created.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn’t build protection.
In defense, they were able to hold hands everywhere, but we couldn’t combine.
It smashed the team's legs.
The work of the opponents was better done.
According to mystery, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to remove the prosperity of the opponents.
In the last quarter, we had zero mistakes, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
The athleticness and tightness that was on the subgroup tournament, our weapon, now turned everything against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The mystery remained in peace with Kalevi, Matthias Tass.
In general, there are good words to say about the whole team, today there was a single blow.
It is a shame that such aggressive opponent has already been confronted before.
The cup has always been self-confident and played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he's wearing quite a burden.
But he made some pretty moves I've seen before in training," the instructor added.
The horrifying numbers: in the basketball box, the EM tournament was thrown by less than 10 points in three quarters...
In the U18-year-old class, the EM B basketball tournament is not limited to young men in Tallinn, and the women began overnight in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland, however, sparked into the anti-rekord area.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, it was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took the foot from the gas pedal, and that period remained at 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia throws a third 1 point...
In the beginning, the ancestors hit two pieces in two minutes of the first four whiskeys, and then over 25 pieces of the game, then one in three and then another 21 shots...
Maybe in almost half an hour, one of 47 whiskeys was hit.
In addition, 2 points came from four free visits.
There was a reasonable number of departures at that time, 12.
At the end of the game, the Polish whiskey was 33 percent (68/9) and in Estonia 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losss, on the opening day it was necessary to recognize the superiority of Portugal 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to complement stocks
Today, NATO 1. Permanent Minor Control Group arrived for a scheduled port visit to Tallinn for the weekend to complement ship stocks and prepare for pre-existing exercises.
During the visit, ships prepare to return to the sea and give team members a chance for a couple of days of holiday.
After a visit, NATO ships remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and be prepared for future historical explosion search operations.
"Estonian participation in the NATO unit and their co-operation in local waters reveals our integration with allied forces," said Captain Arto Reinmaa, Chief of Operation and Planning Department of the Navy fleet.
Since 29 June, the Latvian Navy Commander Gvido Laudups, heads NATO 1, who took over the duties of the ceremony group commander in Riga from the Estonian Navy Officer, Captain Johan-Elias Seljamaa.
The group’s flagship is designated by the Latvian Navy Support Ship LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the group’s headquarters.
In this semester, Sakala, the Estonian Navy Mining Hunter, also belongs to an international unit.
One of the four crews under NATO military leadership is the NATO 1 permanent mine control group, one of the primary fast-reactors, which the alliance may send to different world places within five days.
4 - 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery become a place where 13 years ago the Birgitta Festival was reintroduced by Maestro Eri Klas.
The Birgitta Festival will be a beautiful, powerful and unprecedented artistic leader in Tallinn Philharmonic Risto Joost (36).
Risto Joost: Listeners reach the classics of the opera world, including "Therapy" and "Tosca", ballets by the fantastic "Bolerost" fun "Karlssonin", and also lack their own production of the plan, which is the stage of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratoorium "The Awarders" by the same international creator team that brought Pirital to the stage of Haydn's second masterpiece "Looking".
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre stages.
This is bigger than any music theatre in its usual form.
This is a festival that the charm takes power and never lets go again.
Because the experience that the listener receives in this overwhelming and mysterious environment makes the human souls sounder and touches the human minds in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the first year of Birgitta Festival.
Didn't Maestro Eri Klas shoes seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Class, it has helped a lot.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of the dirigency career.
Maybe because of that, I’ll be easier to continue my work.
Eri Class has injected the Birgitta Festival team so much goodness and, of course, it is all transferred to me.
It was great to join the team who knows exactly how things work.
The great heart of Eri Klas also gave me strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now and I can do it!
What could the audience be excited about this year’s festival that you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and as a surprise the first ballet written on the story of Astrid Lindgren.
That's what "Karlsson is flying."
And one of the criminal noses about it is that the author of this ballet is the author of the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the desire to write this work.
He's probably been living a character of Karlsson since he was a child.
Risto, how do you handle all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner.
Such a work requires a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have it with a fall.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions are not so dependent on other people as much as I am, or how I am going against every new day.
And keeping this conscious tone, maintaining positiveness and actually smiling for yourself in the mirror in the morning, significantly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially this week, when there are the most important samples, I have practiced it especially incredibly and it works.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I think people don’t know half the things about their body, which the universe offers to them, but everyone will discover it at the same time.
Now, there's an important moment.
Do you have a ritual before you enter the dirigend?
There is a need to change clothes against more comfortable.
This is a little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have the opportunity to rest before a big show or a little sleep.
In fact, I even like communicating with people actively, even before entering a dirigend.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here is what to discover not a very big opera and ballet friend!
Watch the moody video with Risto Joost!
New results of the age assessment of Swedish asylic applicants have been published
The latest results of the test show that more than 80% of the untested were estimated older than 18, but not all do not believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for Judicial Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing for the beginning of this year.
The tests were created to evaluate the age more accurately during the application for asyl after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticised for the fact that they have not been able to correctly determine the age of several minor refugees.
Currently, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test and the Court’s Medical Institute has issued a total of 2481 tests from mid-March 2017 until 31 July.
Eighty percent (2002) were estimated to be 18 years old or older and 25 more cases were assessed by the Court’s Medical Institute that the test could be “may be 18 years old or older”.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person was “threeper than 18”.
Tests are only used if the age of a person is under the question mark.
According to Johan Göransson at the Institute of Justice, the results are consistent with the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference compared to previous months' statistics, numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed older than 18 does not necessarily mean that the applicants have lied about their age.
In May 581, the Institute issued the results of the test and said that in 442, there are references to the fact that the investigative person is 18 years old or older.
But when Svenska Dagblade studied the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases, a person had just argued that it would be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, during which smart teeth X-ray images and knee-length MRTs are carried out, which will allow dental doctors and radioologists to analyse, is criticized in some circles.
One of the skepticians is the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute, Claude Marcus, whose job is to assess the biological maturity of humans to determine whether they passed the puberty before or later.
“I have had a reason to think about it, and I don’t think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The determination of a biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't be sure, we shouldn't face that we can," he said to Metro.
But Johan Göransson, the Institute for Judicial Medicine, protected the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of dissolving a child is low.
The biggest risk at around 10% is if a person is a little less than 18."

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old left wrestler, made a beautiful debut on the London MM, getting a great 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was MMi’s youngest female witchwitcher and a happy woman confirmed that he hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and got a good experience.
With the first attempt (64.80) I immediately made my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much and the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear,” Orel said.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's MMi debut ended well at 18th.
The rainfall did not interfere with Orel because he trains the winter through the TTÜ stadium.
"I'm scratched," he said with a little snake.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did Orel perceive people around him or could he turn them off?
I realized, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it gives more - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he was in peace with the MMi debut and that he was still waiting for a lot of good competitions: “I came here in the 32nd season, or the last result, I ended up at 18th.
This is a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and MM - that's the only thing that counts.
I take a good experience and some days I want to compete for medals.
The Governor of West Virginia announced the party exchange
During the meeting on Thursday evening with President Trump, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that he would exchange parties.
“Have it or not, but the democrats walked away from me,” the governor of Justice said.
“Today I will tell you, having prayed and thought so much... today I will tell you, Western Virginia, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor.”
At the gathering, the joys were fired.
“I’m going to be a Republican tomorrow,” Justice added.
"I'd like to tell you that it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a great announcement at the Western Virginia gathering.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, the only billionaire in the state, proved to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns stone coal mines in five states and that he owns stone coal trade from his father.
His value is about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "the exchange of the Governor's Justice Party is another attack on democratic parties, which would rather prevent the country from becoming better than working for it".
"From 15 governors and control over the lowest number of states in history - the statement of Governor Justice is simply the most recent dissolution of the parties that are endless and cannot find a positive and combining message," Ronna McDaniel said to CBS News.
It is no surprise that where there are many people, there are also many injured people.

Coe thanked the Russian honest apologies for the Doping Candal
According to his words, the international noseman Sebastian Coe praised "Russian Thursday's honest apologies" for the doping candle, but he repeated that it is not time for the country to return sports.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, a Russian mild-powered neighbour at the IAAF Congress in the pre-east of the World Championships, said that the contest ban on his country is right and has a strong goal to fight doping.
He apologized to “all mild forces who have been snapped by gold and silver medals in the races.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of leaving in force the contest ban established in November 2015 after the report of the World Antidoping Agency (WADA) found evidence of the country's supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told journalists.
“The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian sub-unit also acknowledged that they had quite difficult times and that they would make everything possible to reorganise the area.”
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted its own criteria for restoration.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress will take place, but the Congress supports the working group's proposal that it is not the right time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
“We have to do everything in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always based on the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the broken system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian mild-powerists who meet the strict criteria of IAAF will compete as neutral athletes in the world championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, Head of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia did not meet several criteria for re-establishment.
After his report to the IAAF Council, he said to journalists in London that the doping control is still insufficient and the trainers who have been banned are still free to act.
The revolution of electric cars significantly alters the demand of metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
A little of the fact that the revolution of electric cars significantly changes everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers on the metal market.
Although mines like Glencore can say that from one place they win and lose, smaller mining companies do not help.
Glencore currently serves stone coal and oil, but in the future the age of electric cars increases in cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel demand.
This year, the UK, France and Norwegian governments have increased their contribution to the spread of electric cars, which allow for the next few decades to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels.
Since then, Volvo has already known that they are planning to give up the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper model 3 electric car on the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that more electric cars are sold over two decades than oil fuels.
"For some metals, it changes everything," said the Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambranin Bloomberg.
We have already seen a significant impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium that have grown demand for years.
In electric cars there are about three times more copper than in the ordinary car, Glencore said.
More copper is needed in loading stations, so Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore comes from an increasing trend in electric cars from the vase price increase and that it is the world’s largest cobalt producer, predicted by Jefferies Group.
According to this broker company, the winners of the winning of electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market responds to a changing trend.
This year, the London Metal Exchange has increased by 70 percent.
The price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also increased by 14% this year, mainly due to growth.
Glencore’s share increased by 20 percent in London after rivaling Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the side of the losers, there are lead-related companies such as Recyclex and Campine who need to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of lead is the battery with the power supply of starters of petrol and diesel motor vehicles.
Electric cars use lithium ions.
“This is a serious risk to the plinish, unless there is any other need for it to overcome the decrease in demand,” said Michael Widmer, the Metal Market Analyst of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In the face of the price movement of lead, the impact of the unfolding trend has not yet been observed.
The lead has increased by 17 percent this year, which is the best metal in the main industrial metals in London.
Investors can see problems with metal in the long future.
“I’m not sure it’s so bad for the lead because cheap oil keeps the ordinary cars in competition,” said Triland Metals’ sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
If the demand of the lead falls, it happens slowly.
It could happen in about ten years.
However, the harder emission standards mean that demand for hybrid cars is increasing, depending on the often developed lead-based batteries in the launch of engines, the international lead and zinc research organization evaluates.
Light metals such as aluminum replace steel because the lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
This is already explained by an additional 1,6 million tons of aluminium egg demand for 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7% of the total production of aluminium in the world.
This trend is likely to deepen, said Widmer.
Aluminum has risen by 13 per cent this year because the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market deficiency.
Steel manufacturers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding collaborates with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of amazing light car gloves.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter melt from steel to resist the aluminum.
"The superior steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, the Exane BNP Paribas analyst.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to the platinum.
The soil cost about half of this precious metal diesel car catalysts, said the metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
“A lot of raw materials, such as oil and platinum, may not have a big demand in the future,” said Bernard Dahdah, Natixis’ raw material analyst.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance becomes within 15 years.
Plastic manufacturers believe that the demand for diesel hybrid cars continues.
The Uncore leader, Marc Grynberg, said, in 2025, more hybrid cars are being sold from full electric cars.
The high hope of platinum manufacturers in the 10 years is developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos based hydrogen element cars that depend on the platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, this technology has not yet justified itself in business.
"Disel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars," said Exane BNP of Paribas Brunet.
In July, the German car manufacturers became part of a large retreat, as Stuttgart’s court prohibited the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche’s hometown.
How football finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing uncontrolled use of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from the world record from the Spanish football club to the Paris-Saint Germain Club in Barcelona.
Whatever the consequences of the UEFA, the leading body, which manages the European game and whose power is to ban the teams from participating in the prestigious Masters League tournament, is still waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
The financial rules for the fair game established in UEFA in 2011 (FFP) mean that PSG has to prove that the transition to Neymar was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) exclusively for purchasing a Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar’s wages are going to reach tens of million dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s transfer to the French club.
PSG will certainly be able to recruit Neymar and add such money to its multi-speed ranking, given that the team is funded by the family of the Qatar’s energy criminal.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they need to balance it with legal income sources that allow them to come out in the football industry.
FFP was founded by Michel Platin after he was elected President of the UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs who fall in the search for success into large debts are actually engaged in fraud and risking loss if banks or owners should refrain from supporting.
Since 2011, the FFP clubs focus on monitoring their losses instead of debts.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a potential club and then make major costs to make the team better and create a global brand - is harder to apply.
For the current three-year evaluation period, which lasts until 2018, clubs may bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platin was dismissed from the presidential office in 2015, UEFA’s successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will continue to strengthen these rules," said Andrea Traverso, who is a UEFA FFP supervisor last week.
Although PSG paid for Neymar’s oversale clause as a single whole-payment, it is possible for them to divide that amount for accounting purposes into parts throughout the period of validity of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year agreement, which is why it is possible to show the transitional fee in the next five years as a sum of EUR 44,4 million per year.
In 2014, for the first wave of the FFP sanctions, PSG, along with Manchester City belonging to Abu Dhabi, received the most severe penalties on the neck.
A fine of EUR 60 million (this moment, $82 million) was imposed on PSG, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the team of the Masters League during the 2014-2015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs who can try to plan over regulatory financial institutions by exploding their income through companies related to the owners of the club.
The Qatar company may sponsor PSG, but if the sponsorship value is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as an official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support had been erupted.
It has been said that a certain part of the service of Neymar PSG can become from the 2022 World Championship Management Committee through payments from Katar.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador of World Championships and claim that UEFA regulatory authorities could easily reveal such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules.
People who were familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition of the PSG to Neymar.
They talked to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is ensured because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
Lastly published reports show that PSG earned more than 10 million euros of profits in the 2015-2016 season at the turnover of approximately EUR 542,4 million.
The data of the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar’s arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
With regard to the conclusion of the contract, the club expects to increase turnover by at least 30%.
Spain too, being clearly irritated by the departure of one of the largest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar from moving, claiming that PSG would infringe the FFP.
"This is a clear "financial doping" case with the club and the country," said President La Liga Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to the Qatar.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to American sports Magnet, shares La Liga's attitude that the country finances the club.
"This is the result of ownership rights, and it has completely changed the whole football landscape in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the rules of the fair game because the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player’s country.”

In addition to the expansion of the Norwegian activity geography, there has also been an expansion in the area of people earned in a plane descent.
For example, the selected persons include Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (picture) and Miguel de Cervantes.

Today 50 years ago: the hurricane storm in Estonia, which ripped the roofs and windows from the houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which caused major damage to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa on 6 and 7 August.
In northwest Estonia, the wind speed was more than 30 m/s over these days.
My old man ran from the garden to the other tree and touched them with his hands to support them.
Everything was blind and ragic, like the end of the world.
Taam already flew roofs from houses, in 2002, the old woman Linda Kurova Haapsalust reminded the Estonian Nature interview.
Linda’s husband saw his planted garden collapsed.
But what do you still support with the wooden hands where you get against that storm?
The sea came under the window, and the windows squeezed into the water," said Mrs Linda, who lived on the street of Haapsalu Kalda.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and that the rail station had flyed 20-30 meters away, Linda saw the most of the Haapsaluans like the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were in the loop land, some completely down, some to half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees as a rag and pragin like a war.
In the August of 1967, West Virumaa could not suffer particularly severely compared to West Estonia, but the damage was also large there, Virumaa Official Journal wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Loss Park and Padise Park were sanctified from the groundwall, but our parks were also severely affected.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was up to 35 meters per second, i.e. about 130 kilometres per hour.
In Tallinn, in the evening of 6 August, a little girl called: "Mom, mother!
“The chickens are in the air and can’t be down anymore,” wrote Virumaa Journal.
The landscape building in Viljandi was destroyed during the storm so that it was later destroyed.
Augustitorm did not resist the structures of the Turk Skiing Hill, which were no longer restored later.
The Red Star wrote on August 12, 1967 that the cleaning of cities and settlements is slowly progressing from the devastated trees and their oxes, and the inhabitants could be involved in cleaning.
In the storm, the grains were also severely affected, and the newspaper said that "party organizations must be both in order to be inspired and guided in the harvesting of fruit."
Orcans can be spoken if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of the blowing wind in Estonia lasts from November 2, 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at the wind speed of 48 m/s.
Onlydloo’s island broke a measuring instrument, so the strong wind speed measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean baths: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Cold summer worlds also mean a smaller cleaning bucket in Tallinn swimming pools.
“If there is no weather, people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people,” the beach cleaner says.
On the beach of Stroom, North Tallinn is screaming.
They are provided with a melody competition in low turns of tractors, which squeeze the strip off the plate.
In fact, the last sews through the sand in depth of seven centimeters, picking out the seaweed and the abandoned rice of people: bottle caps, cigarettes, and more.
People still come to the beach, regardless of whether water is warm or not.
When the weather is beautiful, people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people," says Alexander Usov.
At 6:30 p.m., and the beach has a bitter cleaning work, because at 8 p.m., the plate must be good for people.
Usov is already at 4:00.
In addition to Stroom, he still keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and the Paljasaare Pikakar Beach.
The amount of waste has decreased.
There were a lot more years ago.
People are already able to evaluate what is being done for them,” says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
Before something new was set up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.

One of the biggest works on the Estonian beaches is cleaning sea waste or adru.
For example, in the Pirita beach, it needs to be carried off on the beach season by 400 000 tonnes.
“This is an incredible amount,” says Usov.
Another large category is the human waste, or all that people leave themselves behind.
A half-kilometre beach strip of Stroom has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptyed three times a week.
There's a lot of garbage.
However, colder summer eyes have meant that the garbage is five times less than otherwise.
The third species form abandoned things.
They are mostly children's bones.
As a harvest this time, Usov has scrambled a tenth model car from the inside of the sand.
They will be waiting for the owners on the beach.
"They usually come out more, but it's a normal harvest." Usov already knows that he will soon find them again inside the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them again in the sand.
Waste is dispersed
Erika Scholler, Haaberst’s representative of administrative services, acknowledges that the tractor’s screening work is disrupted by locals.
The noise that lasts from night to early morning will interfere with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
Today, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach must be screened twice.
“If we don’t do this, the city section will fine us,” says Scholler.
However, the aim is to be similar to Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu to get the Stroom beach under the international blue lime quality label.
“Working Europe in Estonia has much more work to ensure that the beaches are maintained,” says Scholler.
We have more adru and stones and harder to cure sand.
But there is less waste on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Having heard that the beach is talking about garbage, Martin, who lives near Stroom, will enter the conversation circle of journalists and cleaners, bringing out the current narrow spots of the beach.
In the morning, there's an ugly picture everywhere.
The problem is with birds and bottle cleaners who have been pulled by garbage bags," Martin said.
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behavioral habits, Martin hopes that the city government will do something with garbage boxes and put them on, for example, covers to prevent at least birds from renewing it.
In general, Martin is pleased with the development of Stroom Beach.
It is seen that the city will take care of it.
With children's fields, lighted and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
“Sometimes it was possible to drive only on one road,” Martin said.
Findings of a treasure hunter in Stroom: coins, only coins
Morning has come to use the 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasurer, combines the beachside with a metal detector.
He doesn’t think that today or in the future it will find anything valuable.
The sea gods are not generous enough.
"I've been working on this for a year and I haven't found anything valuable so far," Dmitri said.
As a hobby, Dmitri’s treasure is a few euro coins, bottle caps, and dangerous pounds that later throw in the garbage box.
There are usually coins.
“There are usually no rings, no rings, and no other such thing,” he says.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
Bank of England expects interest rates to remain at the previous level, as ineffective economic growth and inflation reduction have softened speculations in relation to the rise.
Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains a shade, as households' sealed income has put interest rates on expectations.
The policymakers of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of maintaining 6:2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members demand an increase in this month because slow economic growth has weakened their support for growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced the growth forecast of 2017.7% and its 1,6% in 2018. and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain, as the autumn continues to be expected to increase inflation by 3%.
At the same time, the Bank also pointed out that the increase in rates is necessary for the next few years to control inflation caused by Brexit and that the financial markets may have a higher expected increase than expected.
The members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package, which was launched as a result of Brexit.
In February, the Bank will terminate a fixed-term funding scheme providing banks with cheap funding, although it said that it is now expected to expect a greater offer of 15 billion pounds in this scheme, which is 115 billion pounds.
In Protocols to the Decision on the Determination, the Bank states: "The MMPC’s central forecast will remain ineffective in the near future because the difficult situation in real income in households will continue to have an impact on consumption."
The definitions have been repeated that, in order to mitigate inflation, a "somewhat tightening of finance policy" is necessary, and it is "a lot more" than expected in the markets.
The stock exchange predicts the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that all kinds of jumps were gradual and limited.
The reduced growth forecasts of the bank are compared to 1.9% and 1.7% for the next year.
The forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, the pound rate fell over the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 U.S. dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointment-producing growth indicators, which have suppressed growing hopes in relation to the increase in GDP in the second quarter of the previous three months increased by 0.2% to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it is beginning to accumulate a bit.
The latest inflation report of the Bank gave little reason to rejoice with households suffering from rising inflation and scary wage increases, saying that the situation will get a little worse before improvement.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent the impact of income in the next few years, but a significant recovery of wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to weak pounds, the growing demand for British production also stimulates the economy, which partly compensates lower costs for consumers.
The decision will take a year after the rate was taken by 0.25% in the past August after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully invade prices and the economy.
Before the Bank’s last decision, it was necessary to feel the growing demand for the increase in the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on households in narrowness; in July, three policymakers demanded that the rate be increased by 0.5%.
Inflation decreased by 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although it was expected by the bank, and in the coming months it is expected to rise again.
The bank said that excess growth compared to the 2% goal was caused by a weak neighbour.
Coreco, head of mortgage brokers Andrew Montlake, said: "As a recent decrease in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive, as lenders want to work and hope to end the year positively.
The exchange seems particularly favourable for those whose current transactions will be completed because refinancing, often unserved and low rates, has become increasingly popular."
NHS is describing 10,000 people with contradictions to HIV
Since September, patients have access to preventive treatment of "transformative" HIV after a battle in the Supreme Court on whether NHS should be financed.
NHS England announced that national health care now makes the initial three-year clinical trial estimated to be available to 10,000 people prior to exposure (PrEP) - a tablet that is administered prior to intermediation, which has shown a decrease in the risk of infection in people with high risk by approximately 86%.
NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court that NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite its own claims that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
NHS England’s CEO Simon Stevens welcomed this Thursday’s release as a “new extensive intervention”, while the NAT described it as a “reverse moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, more clinics will be added before the program is rooted everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a curb of HIV medicines taken before the intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV in people with a risk of infection.
Preparation of PrEP prior to intercourse means that the human body has a sufficient amount of certain medicines that prevent infection in HIV.
Such medications can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the intercourse.
The appropriate candidates include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people whose partners have been infected with HIV and cannot be treated.
Clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsexual people and those whose partner with HIV is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can register their wish for participation in the local sexual health clinic in the program.
The programme will cost 10 million pounds and NHS England signed a contract to obtain drugs this week after the international procurement procedure.
The clinical trial aims to assess the real potential of PrEP, collecting clinical evidence of the intended drug and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said, “This new extensive intervention should complement and strengthen the fight against the wider and ever more successful HIV spread.
This is another milestone in the struggle of more than three decades with one of the biggest health problems of humanity."
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said, "This is a turning moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is properly targeted to those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic of England.
Since September, people with high HIV risk have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and is not dependent on negotiating with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly."
Terrence Higgins, CEO Ian Green, said: “Now it is essential to ensure that the clinical trial is rapidly pushed over the country and that no member of the HIV risk group is excluded.
Now that PrEP’s clinical trial medicine has been obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV infection.
Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the preEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delays and the stretch of the government’s legs.
The evidence shows how great changes this medicine can lead to the termination of HIV prevention work and its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will bring us a step closer to the full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that a clinical trial is carried out as quickly as possible in order to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
July decreased the difference between the exchange price of electricity for the next day between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania to 1.94 euros compared to 7.71 euros in June, Elering reported.
The main reason for price difference is the failure of the Lithuania-Sweden Community.
In Estonia, the average exchange price for electricity was 34.33 euros of megawatt hours last month and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percent from 36.27 euros to megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the Nord Pool system price was 26.37 euros per megawatt hour.
The prices increased by 12 per cent and seven per cent respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75 per cent of previous month’s hours in Estonia and 16 per cent of hours in Estonia from Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of hours between the two countries did not have transactions for the next day.
The electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved 99 per cent from Estonia and 73 per cent of the hours of the total transmission capacity was used.
According to the transactions held on the last trading day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the electricity exchange price may be approximately EUR 34 and 37 per megawatt hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the production price of electricity increased last month and the transaction took place at a price of EUR 5.04-5.47 per tonne.
Living high - half floor and smart design lines have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker, a passionate real estate renovator, changed his big Knightsbridge home against Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed his bags and sold the apartment forward is a respect for the new design.
"Even before I lived with a former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
“I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I have offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer on the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-hour-metre apartment has passed the full course of innovation.
In the beginning, it was a single bedroom and a complex apartment - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to use high ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azad’s Notting Hill architecture and design studio in Duck & Shed to use 3.7 m heights of ceilings and create a home that would not be just a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
It was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so there was an architectural challenge to create a half floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complicated," he explains.
“We need to reorganize the spaces, so they were on each other without having to bend.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure so that the height of both upper and lower space is correct."
This setting allowed Erfan to create two full-length rooms in the room with a lot of dramatic elements.
On the semi-store, the old-looking, copper light opens from the Retrouvius window to the glamoury living room below.
Golden furniture with mirror surfaces, silver details and retro-highing Serge Mouille lights emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, spatiality and light.
In both ends of the short corridor, mirrors have been added to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with the mirror leaves an impression of the window opening in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage place for all Joanne dishes and glass containers.
The living room adds the charm to close the kitchen section if it is not used, creating an imagination of the glamorous space.
Collecting kitchens are not new.
However, there is a unique fact in this kitchen that it is a lifted door of the type of garage.
"There was a bit of design in it," Erfan explains from the MDF door swept with steel strength.
"It has a counterbalance, so it slids very easily if it pushes up."
Thanks to the smart use of the room and the storage room, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"In the end of the end, the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to the property," Erfan says.
"The property broker enters an outdated room and makes calculations based on the surface of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor surface by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
“Materjals are the ones you touch and thus help to create an emotional connection with your home,” Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electric cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart sound.”
This shows that good design and increased area helps make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they can create a desire not to leave as happened to Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a Chicago skyfighter headfighter who competes with his colleague for the promotion.
No matter what the amount of money you earn, with all the ethics you forget.
His wife and three children only see him early and late in the morning.
In the first half of the film, I think that this is a "Kaardimaja" business version - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler talk engineer are similar.
What’s going on with the film, the less the cable element remains, and the moralizing intention of filmmakers begins to appear more and more.
As a life-changing experience, the main character becomes a child’s cancer.
It is now necessary to make a choice between work and family life.
The dreaming son of the architects forces his father on walks to the large buildings of Chicago to think of really important things such as faith, goodness, love..., without even touching the catastrophe of twins.
After the third scene where the son opens the eyes of his father, the feeling that filmmakers are based on the goal of the audience to cry, because even with the most expensive heart viewer can’t keep tears back by seeing the sufferings of a beloved cancer boy.
When the son falls into a coma and his head seems hopeless, his father will fully understand his work of morality and do the work of an old man seeking good work.
Now I bet on myself - if the movie is happy, I'll prem my perception after the movie's coffee, but if I'm wrong, the scene can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a doubt that I'm going to miss coffee -- when your husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man storms slowly along the hallway.
However, the son is wonderfully healed, and although his father has just lost work, it is also positive, because it is now time to deal with the family.
I can feel well too – I can predict the end of the American drama!
The film is well constructed, and all the elements necessary for it are available.
You can cry, laugh, actresses are good and morally beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I think this movie will bring you in well.
Trump’s new staff manager plans to limit the media consumption of the President.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do that.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new Head of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow of President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that it keeps the boss in a cleaner water.
Here's a break reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the White House's new staff chief John F. Kelly met with high officials on his first working day, he brought out the key problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he was planning to solve inadequate information to reach the president's hands.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through him, either on paper or on meetings, because the president would make better decisions if good information were given to him.”
Kelly’s diagnosis seems completely logical, but others have tried it and have failed to track Trump’s media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with TV extends over decades, and even now that he is in the White House, his TV-showing habits have not gone anywhere.
“When the candidate Trump was angry about the unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was reflected honestly in the publications that were affected,” said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politicole.
At that time, Politico Tara Palmer wrote that “the six former campaign workers say Trump’s Twitter habits are the key to ensuring that his personal media consumption has a stable record of praise.”
Okay.
But the idea of using Trump Twitter has never been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe those campaign workers know something that the rest of us don’t know that Trump’s sparks would have been even more inevitable without their interventions.
We'll never know about the shines Trump didn't post.
If his assistants were able to save him a few times from the troubles, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from constantly creating noemics.
Part of the problem is that people in the White House, which competes with each other, try to promote their own interests exclusively by sending to Trump material that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, reflecting the course of the story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to feed information with strategically questionable value to the president.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Primes and former Trump are underlined that Trump can respond to negative press, particularly harmful information leaks, explorationally, taking into account the detection of their source.
This also happened at the end of February when someone gave the president a printed copy of the article of GotNews.com of the website of Charles C. Johnson, which accused Katie Walshi of being the source of the White House.
It’s no matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of a distraction, or that he has not provided any specific evidence, or that he has also filed false accusations in the past and taken them back.
Trump read the article and began to ask about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that the former Staff Chief Reince Priebus and the Head of White House Office Rob Porter " have tried to set up a system for managing and documenting documents coming to Trump".
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Maybe he proves to be a more effective leader from Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for the influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad do not get permission for a bitter performance.
In the city centre of Tallinn, many foreigners are mocking.
Those with whom the Nightpage got to talk were admitted to playing in the old town without the permission of the city government.
First, we found three street musicians near the Viru gates who had taken as many dogs with them.
It was clear to see that musicians with racists and loose fabrics were backpackers who needed a shower for berry.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the community played a story with a fun rhythm, while one man next to him called the žongler with three balls and the passers closer.
The third man was sitting next to them on a backpack and smoked a twisted plunger himself.
These three dogs did not let themselves be disturbed by the transient people.
Bob, who played with Noem and balls, told me that they played on the streets for fun and money.
The aim of the community’s performance was to collect ticket money on a ship flying to Finland the same night.
The question is whether they asked the city for permission to play in the old town, shake Noemi and Bob's head.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple and mostly give permission for a month or something like that.
It's not worth paying for it," Bob explained.
When we got back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians and were driving them away.
The community moved to the crossroads of the Viru Centre with backpacks and dogs to touch happiness.
There were also three Polish young men on the Viru Street, one of whom played a violin, another klarnetti, and the third had brought an electronic piano.
“We are here to provide people with entertainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living,” Mivosh explained.
According to Mivosh, they are aware that the city government must have permission to perform.
“Of course we don’t have it,” he said.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we're going somewhere else, but we have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank purchased bonds for 149 million euros in the framework of the euro area central banks' public asset purchase programme in July, the central bank's bond portfolio increased to 4.36 billion euros.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases.
In response to the interruption of members of the Riigikogu, President Hardo Hansson of the Estonian Bank has previously explained that the asset purchase plan of the Eurosystem central banks covers three different purchasing programmes: the covered bonds of the financial sector (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public bonds (PSPP).
The central bank purchases bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest elsewhere.
As a result of the purchases, the production of lower risk assets is reduced and motivates investors to take greater risks.
In general, in the framework of the public debt purchase programme, each central bank acquires its government bonds, and the debts of other countries are not purchased.
Since the Estonian State has not issued debts, the Bank of Estonia will make the so-called replacement items within the amount allocated to them.
The replacement purchases are also made by central banks in countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
Eesti Pank generally purchases bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank purchases bonds under the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering’s bonds were also purchased, but from June 2016 the Bank of Estonia will no longer buy Elering’s bonds.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, both Elering and Estonian Energy bonds are purchased by the Central Bank of Finland since June.
Travelers ignore the scratch and return to the "Millioners' Region"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of West Midlands have reappeared to anger with determined migrants who have ignored the dignified deck to win back the field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 trailer booths on the field as a wealthy "million-region" crossed by Solihull Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children and trucks after they were swept out in May, without letting themselves interfere with the garage that was dignified by the board to prevent their invading.
The tactical group found a weak place in the protection boundaries by squeezing their vehicles through the unlocked part that had been left on foot.
The rabbits of residents have been banished by the Solihull Council, saying that the council is "needless in dealing with the problem".
One anonymous resident said, "They moved there Monday night after their explosion of Bentley Heath, where they were throwing passers with stones.
The Council must be embarrassed to start acting because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The migrants were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back.
They came back last night, probably even more today."
He added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protecting its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I am not pleased that I have to continue to pay the voluntarily tax if the council can’t even prevent such a thing.”
One local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's ridiculous. We just saw the last of these travelers leave, and there's already a new attack.
This time the number has grown, and even the horse has been seen in the grassland.”
“We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite near Streetsbrook, and we work with Solihull’s police. We apply the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
The collection of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling number 101.
It helps to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The Weekend Festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture, Indrek Island, who is pleased to bring the real world’s top names to Estonia.
To the question why the Weekend Festival is so important for Estonians, the island answers that it should be asked from all those who enjoy the festival for three days on the full breast.
But he admits that the real people in the area have come to Pärnu.
"With the level of artists that can be brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre will be brought home - this often does not happen in our bearings," says the minister of culture.
What festival does the artists talk about themselves most?
I think I am a relatively old man and for people like me, one of the most experienced artists, Armin van Buuren, who came up last night.
According to his recording, at some point all of us have turned their own legs,” he says.
However, he will bring out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own artists in Estonia: starting from NO.P. and reading them in a whole row.
In reality, the concentration of known names is very high," he says.

Audi updates up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of criticism hit by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it would offer software supplements for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the BMW Chairman, the company believes that "There are smarter variants than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the BMW hometown Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be renewed to reduce diesel engine emissions.
None of the companies described these operations as a return call.
European car manufacturers have encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitric oxide from diesel engines is considered to be a carcerogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise diesel gases for automotive companies is also increasing, making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
While the German car manufacturers are undergoing an in-depth investigation, the Chancellor of the Union is also accused of the suppression of powerful car manufacturers and of the disregarding of the marks to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen errors, which quietly disrupted the use of such fraudulent devices, which allowed to adapt the example of exhaust gases to comply with the regulations during the test of the car, but reversed in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been accused in the United States and the others are both sides of the Atlantic Ocean investigation.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamic department of Audi engine development was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from the issue and may go to court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was attracted to the criminal investigation of Volkswagen in Germany, when the authorities accused the installation of the Audit system in order to divide the requirements of European emissions gases by extending the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The involvement of the audit in the investigation may be a major hoop for Volkswagen by the manufacturer of luxury cars generates a disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen’s profits.
The European Union flags are awarded to Estonian schools for €20,000.
The Ministry of Education intends to purchase flags from the European Union to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
Overall, 105x158 centimeters of the European Union flag receive 570 educational institutions.
Tickets are intended for exhibiting indoor spaces, they must also be carried out in high quality printing equipment indoors with tunnel confirmation, via the ERR news portal.
The label of the flagvarda has a text: "A gift for Estonian schools to mark the first presidency of the Council of the European Union of Estonia.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the cost of the Ministry of Education, which is that one flag will cost EUR 35.
The reporter's murder highlights the growing threat in Mexico
Riodoce employees usually gather on Wednesdays to review the plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, which are sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their security.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two older writers discuss which seems safer: whether to bring children to the office that was targeted by the granade attack in 2009 or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on the front end of the room: "The enemies", "neutrals", "ligans".
They ask reporters to provide the names of each column not necessary to provide evidence, enough impressions and inner sense.
In the absence of government or cartels, drug traffickers, politicians, business men and journalists are suspected of a whole list of offenders that make the reflection of the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
The majority of the bodies gathered across the country are journalists, according to journalists, they have been killed by President Enrique Pena Nieto since the admission of at least 25. 589 journalists in December 2012 after attacks and threats under national protection and during this year at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The last dead include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce’s contributor Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep sense, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building hangs a great picture of the middle finger showing Valdez with a letter "Just" and two 30th reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing a T-shirt with his smiled glasses with a face or a characteristic pancake for him.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death, the reporters discuss joint trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecution was established in 2010 to deal with journalists, only two cases have been brought under the legal responsibility of the Journalist Protection Committee.
As for most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, with a number of thousands, journalists rarely come to court.
Riodoce continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice of the murderers, Ibarra said there is no great benefit from the meeting on security.
“It’s very stupid to waste time in this meeting,” he says.
"As long as the reason is not known, you're disgusting everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan on May 15.
He managed to drive only a few quarters before two men stopped him from the red Toyota Corolla. He was forced to leave the car and shot 12 times. This is expected to be due to the name of the newspaper, which means translated "twoteenth river".
The armed man drove away from Valdez's car and crashed in the vicinity of it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left a woman and two adult children.
The news spread freely in Culiacan.
But on Valdez, only silence is dominated.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and issued to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the most bloody battles in the country because the cliques rivally fight for the execution of the power force.
There is no difference in the Sinaloa streets being shot every day by a person or even several people, or that the graveyard is plunging abundantly decorated of the two-fold drug kings’ mausoleums that are larger than many living homes.
Let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one cartel heads the seafront state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the risks associated with his work, Riodoce, the contributor and President Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels huge guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes have contributed to killing.
The first of them was the publication of an interview with the Guzman's sons in February with the nephew Damaso Lopez, a cartel competing with the Guzman's sons.
This piece of paper might have hated boys by suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived in the newspaper.
Another mistake was that Valdez did not force him to leave the country for his own security after the adventure took place in another newspaper that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had stayed alive so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he was always there.
He worked at Noroeste in 2003 as a veteran reporter when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar units.
Bojorquez said in Sinaloa, “It was impossible to deal with journalism without any drug problem.”
The newspaper gathered its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish powerful research without fear of the censorship and readers in a lucrative print that they could read stories that no one dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its Latin American reflections.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize (AKK) to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He clearly acknowledged that he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he said with the AKK award.
Last October, he told Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking was a lifestyle in Sinaloa.
“You need to take the task that the journalist’s second chance is to play foolishly.
I don’t want to ask me what I did when I faced so many deaths, or why I didn’t tell you what was going on.”
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who roped like the sea, a friend who kindly shared embassies and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar and sat on the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became destiny to him.
His death has also made them doubt about how to do their work best and stay alive.
"They don't like to bully with these women, their children, their legal business, the secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
“These things were not to be touched,” Bojorquez said.
The result is even in the best times a strong self-secret and self-subject.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said the problem is that "the smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa no longer apply, just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros or other states, which are home to the toxic co-operation of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupted state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff were gathered for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before it was revealed that only governments were used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for a lightning of 40 degrees of heat.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, located in a four-store building in the middle class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered whether these police officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself had unfaithful debriefing.
Several months have passed since the reporters have travelled to mountainous lands where control is in the hands of the drug forces.
Riodoce’s publication of this week discussed three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the former boxing league of Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had an overwhelming story about spending government money on the governor’s hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about the one who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time to write what everyone in the city knows is both the attraction of drug dealers and the authorities.
Reporter became aware of the public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who belongs to the institutional Revolution Party (IRP), which dominated all the levels of politics over the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of a widely reflected case in corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous incidents in the same place, including how the name El Chapo's son of Guzman escaped the military.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have searched for the Valdez column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose dressed bodybuilding has earned his nickname El Flaco.
“Now, all communication channels have been broken with our sources.”
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and editorial workers have become something they never expected to activists for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of tags and went to the local prosecutor's office next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the West Michoacan State three days after the death of Valdez.
The body was found and officials said it belonged to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more pronounced across the country and criticize the "SOS Press" phrase as organised protests on footways and buildings.
On this day, President Bojorquez is in Washington, trying to collect international support for justice in Valdez.
The day after Valdez died, when he met the governor Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the journalists of spying and killing them because of telling the truth.
After that, he asked him to redirect government activities to another place, worrying that his anger has influenced his objective.
Valdez had repeatedly said that the Mexican journalists were "limited in this."
In his last book "Narko Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug forces, but also by the command of politicians and security forces organized by crime in the past.
In the last year, more than half of the attacks of journalists were assigned to police and state officials.
“In Mexican you will die because you will be quiet,” Ramirez said.
The murders are apparently blood-resistant.
No one forgets blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias' death in Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter that probably signed by a cartel in Los Zeta: "I'm here for my reports."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to his sleeved head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, for example, the newspaper El Norte in Chihuahua, North Border State after their correspondent, Miroslava Breach, was killed in March.
Others continue as El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their president in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug cartelle, “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have escaped from home states or even the country.
This is a decision of nerve cancer.
It is difficult to find a job in exile and they still have to hide the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they will be pursued, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in one of Mexico's apartments three months after leaving Veracruz.
Those who remain in position and continue to work must dance every day around risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that the reflection of the drug business scares him.
"The Mexican is on the way to hell and that's why I started to be a reporter," he said.
On the midnight of a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, the editors of Riodoce sat on the way to the office and roared a beer when suddenly all the phones started vibrating.
In Mazatlan, the coastal resort, 19 people were killed in the forces of rivalry and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as were promised by several posts of cartels found in the region.
From the same side of the walk, reporters put news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The next day's first partner needed to change.
The sirens swept through another firewall in the area.
Bojorquez was in the vicinity of the police to see if they were vigilant.
If they were afraid, they did not show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the founder of the newspaper, where his average finger is visible to all Sinaloa, the workers of Riodoce delivered in his footprints.
"How can I even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "When Javier was killed on the same day, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaurus used a protective color to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a shape, although quite frightening.
Scientists have now disclosed the first findings regarding the incredible size of the Canadian miner, which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered with her rings was red brown color and his past had been somewhat "complicated".
The report published in Current Biology described the nature as "the most preserved soomus dinosaur that has ever been found" and as "one of the best dinosaur entrances in the world".
For fossil, it is a new type of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the critical era, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation is open scientists who describe it as "really significant".
This vegetarian covered with sooths is the best preserved type of fossil that has ever been found in the National Geographic data of the magazine.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he extracted Suncor Millenium in the mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn’t remind me of the surrounding stone, and decided to study more closely.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrelli Palace Museum.
For the next six years, it was developed to extract the animal out of the land of 2500 pounds (1100 pounds).
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready for the public.
“If you kiss a little eyes, you can almost believe that you’re sleeping,” said the leading author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrelli Museum where the nature is exhibited.
"This goes into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur entrances - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
When investigating his skin, scientists found that this vegetarian, who was covered with rings and reminds of the walking tank, was likely to be at risk of meat-fooded dinosaurs.
It used red and white protective color in a lot of rings, to hide from the predecessors, and applied a shadowing technique called the suppression and also used by many modern animals.
According to experts, this allowed dinosaurs to be better enclosed and avoid enemies, as the larger dinosaurs likely hunted him.
This 110 million-year-old family of nodosaurs first came to the news in May and is now visited in the Royal Tyrrelli Paleontology Museum.
The scientists have now studied the nature and gave it the name of Borealopelta markmitchelli’s museum laboratory, Mark Mitchell, who was part of a team that spent more than 7000 hours exposing the animal to be effortful.
Due to the amazing maintenance of the person, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of researchers were able to document the shape and size of the animal on the body.
They discovered the suppression - the protection method common in the animal state, which means that the top side of the being was darker than the bottom.
Although the resistance is common, the findings come as a surprise, because Borealopelta is much bigger than the animals living with resistance today.
This suggests that dinosaurs were actively hunting enough by other muscular food dinosaurs, that evolution prefers to be hidden instead of a survival act.
However, most of the animals that use contemporary suppression – such as deer, sebrates, or armadillis – are much smaller and more vulnerable as harvests, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to really work to survive.
"The powerful hunting of dinosaurs with a large and numerous rings shows how dangerous they could have been from the dinosaurs of the critical age," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the gums also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get hints of this life, including the preserved content of this intestine, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur died in the river, thus reaching a stream of sea, where he fell in the back of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further to the inland than now.
"This nodosaurus is truly significant because it is fully covered with a residual skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, maintaining the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the critical era.
To reconstruct it, there is no need to use a lot of imagination - it’s just enough to kiss your eyes and it seems like she’s sleeping.”
The time of the crisp was when the earth was swiming huge dinosaurs from muscle meals on two legs - teropods.
Although their king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, some of his fearful predecessors could hunt it from the absorptioned dinosaur.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons of weighting monster.
Researchers whose recent findings have been published in the Journal of Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was washed in the sea after death and it mumphisized in the mud.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered its existence when he extracted the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in the world of soomusdinosaurus, including skin and bowels, and it is a comprehensive convenience to hips.
These beings were an average of 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch valleys invaded their shoulders.
Scientists believe that this vegetarian covered with sooths had adventured through the current West Canada until the flooded river was washed over its open sea.
However, the underground funeral site of the dinosaur helped to preserve its properties in excellent detail.
The stoned residues of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the muscular rubber plates along the heads of the dinosaur still cover skin residuals.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "The level of preservation is as rare as the lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The extinct skin residues still cover the skulls of the animal.
The right front foot lies next to him and five of the toes are straight upwards.
I can count the rings on his house."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Who streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell became a full shock.
Only a day after traveling to New York, this St. Louis resident sat on a bed rented through Airbnb, browse on Facebook.
He was posted by his former schoolmate.
He said, "The police killed just 18-year-old, and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused why no one else had sent this information to his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Constant @TheePharoah posts were repeatedly distributed on his timeline.
In real time, the rapper from St. Louis, sent Michael Brown, unarmed for the death of a 18-year-old black man killed by a white policeman in Missouri in Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought himself.
Death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put off his phone, but later evening he saw a blink that reported the gathering of people on Canfield Drive this time.
They shared photos of police tapes and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a sign of "Ferguson's police killed my unarmed son!"
He looked at the real-time flow, where the police officer stood in front of the group of protestors with a dead dog.
In the second video, another policeman said he had a gun and screamed, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrelli remembers how she hit herself from the thought: "It's unusual."
"This is not the kind of murder we've been used to and what we might call typical."
I felt scared at the moment.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a flight back and went home the next day.
When he landed at 23 p.m., he went to his father's six-year-old daughter and decided they'd drive the next morning alone to Ferguson.
What happened with Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is the main theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Kelle streets?"), which will be pre-introduced in the cinema on 11 August.
This is the story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and strength of people who live in this community and who met the answers of the streets.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who had a flower dress on her head, went to Ferguson, they again talked about what they had spoken before that morning, about the experience and living conditions of the black people.
“Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for his rights?” he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving Ferguson now because the police killed the 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
“I couldn’t take him,” Ferrell said later.
“What’s going on is the culmination of the past.
He needs to know and see and grow in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organisation and also feel different layers of black experiences and living conditions and what we need to do to get free and free.
Even if I succeed in raising him in such a way that he does not personally experience fearful racism, he does not differ from another black girl.
I feel like I'd make her a bear if I defended her from this world."
The first stop they did when they arrived at Ferguson was on the way to South Florisant - the police station, which had become a certain kind of campsite, where activists were waiting for news about policeman Darren Wilson, who had not finally been charged.
Ferrell and his daughter joined the local business owner who made lunches.
They put together food bags and helped share them with protesters.
For Ferrelli, new kind of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activity changed completely after 9 August," he said, pointing out that when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, he was president of the Less Student Union and focused on food justice and health-related inequalities in black communities.
“I had no organizational experience.
It was all just broken."
Weekends later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folian at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and his film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to just document the event.
Ferrelli asked the question: “Do you try to document or find a story that can be used?”
Such skepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white skins - come into the community and try to cut the benefits of pain and durability.
Folian explained in the recent interview: “We had heard that the voice of people born and grew in Ferguson was not heard and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already beaten hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the region who was known for activism in relation to the sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project linked to Ferrelli and six other locals who were tracked by the team of "Whose Streets?" after shooting Brown for years.
“No one talks about us or us in this documentary, but we talk about ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was important to me how these people were imagined because I was also imagined.”
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrelli’s experience – they wanted to show that the movement was not a "lost guide, but a community meeting," as Folayan said, he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly documents personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as love and marriage to his wife.
“I felt like I was naked,” Ferrell said, laughing at the first time when he saw the tape.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanization of black people must be associated with certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrelli’s story emphasizes and reinstalls the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three beginners who thought in social media in 2012 after killing a black teen Trayvon Martin are homosexual.
“In the current role, black homosexual women have maintained movement in general,” Ferrell said, “and that is precisely because we have to constantly fight on several fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that “the movement is truly kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women.”
He claims, however, that "doing is not with any type of equal opportunities" - Ferrelli did not choose to be the center of the film because of his identity.
“He was a man from whom he exploded the right energy,” he said.
"But it is not a coincidence that he was located directly on the front line, because a black homosexual woman in such nodes is considering a lot.
His energy can be perceived through the screen.”
At the same time, newscams from Ferguson have long gone, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
During the demonstration of Ferrelli, the conditional penalty for blocking the road will continue to last for 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy airstyle in the area he calls home, just "smoking."
However, he still finds it important for a mantra that he has eaten the memory since he went on Ferguson streets three years ago.
“Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
7 tips on how to get over the pohmel after Weekend party
Some of the strongest men find a party after a day off, that the trouble, too, helps.
Or they are based on the word "out of the pohmell, stay drunk."
But this is just an inevitable postponement and a proper condition for health.
What can you do after today and tomorrow’s Weekendi trall - or other party - to feel better in the morning and get as painfully as possible over the pohm?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and down, after a big party in the morning ... or even, if possible, instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses alcohol while it consumes a lot of fluids, it has to be recovered.
In addition to water, minerals are also washed out of the body and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomachs are often irritated after drinking, it is especially good to have a bubble-free or only easily gasted.
Go for a walk.
It would certainly not cost you to go to Grandma to break trees - it may be a fateful wrong decision.
But the easy walk helps the body remember how it feels to be alive again.
Sleeping in the tent and sleeping out of the pohmaka is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give the body energy back gradually and carefully.
If you're going to get an occult from last night, it's definitely not worth trying to load a large fat sauce.
Start with fresh juice, for example, containing fruit sugars in your body to market quietly.
If the health of the southern place is already suffering, you could try, for example, a wedding.
And a little later, the back of the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic releases your body from the last water.
As has already been said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a pohmell at night, your liver has to deal with a lot of paracetamol or ibuprofen and loses performance in addition to alcohol.
So you break your liver even more and there will be worse in the future.
In addition, the painkiller will not stay in the body for as long as it is.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it with an empty stomach - it irritates your dirty stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you'll get along well with yourself.
It works about the same way as walking, but when you walk, you can't get an orgasm.
Avoid too active tempo and crazy poses - during the pohmelli, physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Time a foolish story with friends and associates, make simple fools and laugh friendlyly over yourself and others (resistants).
A joke and a laugh may not make the pohmacat, but it will certainly be more fun to bear the aftermaths with them.
Once again, the pohmell goes over anyway!
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University employee are being sought as suspected murder
According to the police, the professor of Northwestern University and the employee of the University of Oxford, who has become suspected after finding a dead body of men with deadly stabbing wounds in one of Chicago's luxury apartments.
According to the Cook County Court Documents, on Monday, the arrest orders for 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued for the arrest of the first-grade murder due to the alleged death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
The police received a phone call and found a victim in the body with multiple stab wounds when they arrived at Grand Plaza's apartment.
According to the officials, Cornell-Duranleau was recognized to be dead at the event and the investigators are concerned about being stabbed as a murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor for microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement by Vice-President Alan K. Cubbage of Public Relations of the University, Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and is prohibited to enter the city centers of Northwestern University.
“It is now a criminal investigation of the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University is working with the investigators,” Cubbage said.
Warren is a parent member in the financial department of the University of Oxford.
In an e-mail statement from the University and Somerville College, we have been in contact with the British police and are ready to help U.S. research institutions in any way possible.
In addition, the statement stated that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and desired to give themselves out.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago Police Department's Communications Department, urges suspects to give themselves up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are working on the exact location of the police," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, suspects will be helped by both local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said that the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza Corteror, who had just received a cryptical hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to the police, it was a spectacular vision.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said that security cameras confirm the presence of Lathem and Warren in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” said Guglielm.
Grand Plaza’s management sent a letter to the inhabitants: “The police are currently working on the chronology of events and the background of the victim and explores various motivations, including the possibility that it was a family member.”
Businesses that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in his e-commerce start-up company, but the surveys were profitable.
The answers were often unequal, useless, or even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Madison Reed, who runs the e-commerce company selling hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called for help from outside people.
There are new types of human resources-based start-ups that help companies to find out what their employees know.
Developing and licenseing software with a clear aim to measure the involvement of workers, allowing companies to conduct sudden interviews, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line of complaints, and in some cases allow linguistics to go through C-level leaders and contact directly to the board.
“Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” asked Jim Barnett, Associate and CEO Redwood City, Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to this, he has received a much better overview of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to sudden research and specific team surveys, this provides a company’s heat card, which provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which leaders have the lowest support, allowing them to explain the reasons.
Entrepreneurs have started to understand that they must remain aware of their work culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been rebeled in scandals since the former employee published a blog post, which described the abusive environment where they were punished by those who dared to speak.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global management, regulation and compliance area may be worth more than $ 118.7 billion in accordance with the Let's Talk Payments website for 2020.
Convercent, a start-up company operating in Denver, Colorado, which helps businesses prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, observed interest and activity growth in Uber's suspicious reputation this year.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a client.
As in Glintk, Convercent allows companies to send customised pulse surveys, collect real-time confidential responses and look at the heat cards from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous communications line that allows employees to know the inappropriate behavior.
And if the CEO is concerned, the complaints will go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been banned by regulatory authorities," said Convercent's founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if it is found that the company treats its employees poorly or acts unethically, the company may face serious consequences such as consumer boicots, workers’ departures and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and operations and to provide an easy way to communicate with the headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the headquarter phone number or e-mail address, file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a discomfortable and uncomfortable process, Ruby Tuesday said General Advisor James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track workers’ complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, there are problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair salary practices that have not previously reached leaders who acted in offices in other cities or states, to quickly identify and deal with them.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360 degree experience of workers," Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group on Ruby Tuesday.
“And we protect our partners from disputes with employees.”
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behavior, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed in connection with the Enron scandal due to ethical violations.
But only when “social media became mature,” the companies realized that they could not prevent their black washing from being publicly washed on the web.
Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supported by both start-up companies.
Convercent was funded by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, raising the capital collected to $47 million.
In November, Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments will not be a surprise when taking into account the interconnection between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that today’s employees expect more from work than before.
Competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, have high wages and interesting projects merely on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy in the company, they feel that they are listened to and that the work they are doing is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, who is Vice-President of the General Benefits and Experience of Workers in LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies belonging to their portfolio are doing well; businesses are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools allow you to increase your employee’s commitment and involvement, it is no wonder they find support.
Knowledge of employee involvement is important, according to the professionals of working culture.
However, these data are useless if the company’s executives don’t do anything with them.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback from his employees, the company may create expectations that changes are expected to occur.
And if changes do not take place quickly or at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask for 4000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4000 discussions," said Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen how businesses make a mistake to rely on too much data.
“For if things aren’t written to the end, the employees think, “Do you really take me to hear?
Do you care?
And if you don’t care, why should I care?”
According to this, Madison Reed, who now conducts six studies among employees, has been able to take measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from disappointed workers at the speed of decision-making and communication quality, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and offer communication training to address problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, collects new data on workers and hopes that in the long run, this will lead to the long-term commitment industry of workers, which is known for the flow of their large workforce.
“If you are not committed to transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
“And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.”
The euro area’s bright star is Baltic: income is rapidly growing
Although in the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes a reference to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the ECB, since 1999, the total economy production per person has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
There is a low debt burden, rapidly improving institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
“Baltic countries in one of Slovakia are among few euro area countries where real GDP per person has been significantly approaching the EU average,” the central bank said.
Although the goal is to equate the total economic output per person with the richer Western Europe, in 2015, the Baltic economy’s total production per person was only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries belonging to the European Union prior to the enlargement circle in 2004.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for a better salary abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in positive light and the economy is growing today, local residents are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer study, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents assessed that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, less than half of the surveyed people thought this about their economies.
NCAA’s decision to cancel twice a day’s exercises will make Bruins’ days long
It is almost 23:00 when the trophy of UCLA footballers stops talking to the team at the campus of the campus.
Some of them have squeezed a shirt from their backs, exposing the efforts of their first day of training.
For a large part of the team, these teams offer medieval breaks.
During the summer courses, players will head back to co-work after three hours to study for final exams before returning to Wasserman’s football center at 6.30 p.m. next morning.
"The next three days are a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said a little before Monday became Tuesday.
NCAA's decision to cancel the load of players twice a day, has actually changed their days longer - at least until the final examinations on one side of the Friday.
For this reason, the UCLA had three first training scheduled to start at 19.15 to match the players with a tight schedule.
Transition from two training days a day means more days with one training - the beginning of Bruins training courses was increased over the last season, almost a week ahead and for the first time during the courses of the summer courses in Mora six Westwood seasons.
They have 18 training schedules until 20 August before the official preparation for the opening game in September for Texas A&M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA change in the rules, although it adds another item to the tight charts of players.
“They have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge,” Mora said.
“And they break themselves through this struggle; they make effort, they are nice young people.
“I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it’s really nice.”
When the camp is finished, the UCLA training is closed, which is not a simple task, given a clear view of their fields from the nearby parking area and the nearest Luskini center, the higher-class hotel, which has already been hit by the footballs that have escaped from the gatemail network.
Since this weekend, the players in Bruins are hosting the hotel, but Mora acknowledged that problems could occur with free rooms during the season.
"We're implementing security measures," Mora said.
“It’s a real concern and it’s not too overreacted to think that people can rent a room and work out there.
If you have a recording of exercise, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're using security teams on the 8th parking lot.
We will do our best by using our existing ones.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan in place."
In order to vengeance the Election Union of Savisaare-Ivanova, the Christianina Ojuland and EKRE from the Reform Party, created by the merger of the forces of the Mariana Kaljus, on our Tallinn and the Party, seems to be at least as much as the political parties are involved in the local elections in the initiative of the Party.
However, the chicks are considered to be in autumn, and the key issue is whether they all share enough disappointed voters.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
If the Edgar Savisaare support group has fallen small, it may be unauthorized of the events organised for its electoral union.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current environmental and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And why do some loyal sidekeepers and friends of the Savisaare’s Savisaare in Tallinn have a reason to seek that the list of deputies “Savisaares”, which are suspected of corruption and corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
The music video film filmed on the roof of the city department in the Russian-speaking pop song involving the older part of Lasnamäe; and, in any way, the original computer game in which the Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid the voices of the 16-17-year-old voters to be allowed by the Environment for the first time?
We will look forward to the idea of a young election campaign by other political parties.
If the channel 2 or TV3 views the black square from the beginning of August instead of the entertainment pool, there are two options: agree that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels will be viewed in the free range or released to some teleoperators every month.
There are probably also those who initially enjoy publicly advertising-free telekommunication experience, but at the end of all, although contradictoryly, pay for television and advertising.
The garbage left on the streets is the unpleasant side effects of every major music festival.
If you don’t want to get a share of the noise, instead of hurting your head at home, you should go to the home and leave a sleeping place for a cranky amount to the festival guests.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
The media publications quote President Donald Trump, who said there is a new U.S. immigration plan that changes the green card rules.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for the acquisition of temporary work methods and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The Bill will go to the two houses of the Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, as it changes the way it delivers green cards to other US citizens.
The law reduces chain migration and starts to replace the current program.
The new application process benefits candidates who speak English and have financial resources for their own support and skills that benefit our economy," Trump said.
Siberian seto young people move to the city, pensioners return to the country.
Jevsejevi Anatoli continues the tradition of the former famous seto gold miners of the river Maana.
He works 140 kilometers away from home as a driver of gold artell on the side of Maana’s additionaljoo Kuvai.
It's hard work: two months in a row without resting days, 12 hours work and then only 10 days at home and back.
In three years of work in Artelli, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
"There's a hard time: there's a thorough check on the way in that vodka doesn't bring, and when you go out, you don't bring gold," Anatoli says.
Mare Piho talks to Haida in the village with local seto Jaan, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of Siberian setoes will also affect home-cetoes because it is just so amazing, thinks the most thoroughly explored by Piho Mare.
His first study trip to Siberia lasts 30 years this year.
During that period, he has been there 14 times and lived there a year.
How many seats did Siberia still travel out at the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century to get the land here?
This is an unsolved question.
I'm saying 8000.
I figured it out by Siberia's seto men, who have thought about it myself.
It's quite hard to say, because at that time, there could have been up to 30 people in one group, but the passport was granted only to a man.
The pass was only given to one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this area was here!
It was several times bigger than historic Setoma.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
Setod came here as farmers, but their lives changed, because here they came to areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (flooring), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Petseri, many setos later worked in a classified city in Krasnojarsk-45 (then the Soviet power built the uranium plague - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the setos form a majority of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and multichildren remained long.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much of Siberia’s seto culture differed and differs from mother’s setoes?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They did the same, but they always did the difference that was brought and what had been done here.
Climate change strongly influenced the traditional clothing of setoes because it is colder here.
Food changes.
For example, in Setomaal, the meat was salted, but it was just cold.
Where are the villages of Siberian setoes and what lives there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The relationship with the motherland was mentally strong, and it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back to it, it's going to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
The Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida in the day of the Kingdom of Seto at the beginning of July and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What's still here is amazing.
“It’s very easy to come and go away, because the city has a great place of residence: the railway noise and the road crossing point,” says Reigo Tamm.
The city is no longer just a military leader, we have lots of nature, sports and culture, and the pizza is available at every corner.
Kill is the top-topp city!
There is a small island along the White River that runs through the city, where the murderers practice the jannies.
"This beautiful place does not appear from the train window," Reigo mumbles.
Whoever does not fear cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
You can keep a picnic in the river and simply make romance - you can face the flow of the river and think about life before and behind.
I've been walking with my girlfriends, too.
After all, Ooperisolist Tamm has been on the riverside between three bridges to practice his archipelago: “When this place is at the side of the city, no one may come up with it when his stories come together.”
"A wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, winter ski, and now, for example, discgolf play - golf course has been made, disks can be borrowed from the sports centre," Reigo leads.
The old professors are going there with their discs, but I haven't played there yet.
You probably need to visit Mr. Rasmus Kull Tapa because he has a experienced discgolf player and has discs.
He lends to me!
Reigo and Männikmäki were inseparable for the ages of the current operasolist’s childhood.
At least during ski lessons.
There are many tears, disappointments on this mountain, and you can win in my sports life.
Not to mention broken squirts and skies.
“The whole city is now full of construction work, everything changes to anonymity,” Reigo praises.
Kill an old and tired vacant building, however, is a very attractive place to play summer responses.
I am pleased that in 2012, the leader of R.A.A.A.M.M. Mart Meos accepted my idea and came to a vacant theater with my theater.
Although this year’s theatre season “Aleksei Karenin” was just over, on 11 August, the railway station is “Freaching” when the old vacancies are moving around in the 1980s.
"After 11-13 August, the days of the city of Tapa, under which the vacant building has been awakened by open houses, and there are a series of cultural events, including a folk race," Reigo, who suggests that the 91-year-old city be visited in those days.
In a small yellow house on May 1, the palace road has been a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibitions are very much and the information is immensely," Reigo praises the place full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on rail and military.
Reigo tells us that if the Tapa is going through all the recommended places, the stomach will be empty long, but fortunately, the small town is full of cafes.
“We have so good dining places and when sitting in cafés sometimes feels like you’re abroad,” he describes.
The trained and young soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cabins, since sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international community together.
I think it would be very exciting to listen to stories from French or Americans.
Warriors, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tent in Greece
BTV quoted the foreign ministry who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tent in Greece.
In the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegally camped people on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but they are currently investigating.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told BTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free tent and already impose hard fines for all who are missing in a place not prescribed for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose fines.
The puppies teach the wolves go to break the sheep.
After a break, the Hiiumaa farmers have to return to the wolves from their flock to their "studies" - wolves that have probably taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year wolves have broken sheep in the region of Hiiu three times, total 23 sheep and injured eight, written by Hiiu Leht.
The number was only three years ago 124.
There are also data from the Environment Agency with breaking syncs that the Hiiumal wolf site was not born and the Hiiumaa Hunting Council information that this year two wolves were fixed on the island.
In the evening, the wolves broke the land of Emmas in Kabuna and injured 18 of the survivor’s sheep.
On Wednesday early morning, wolves broke one sheep in the flock of the village of Reheselya and injured a lot of others who had to take an emergency.
The rules for the processing of genetically modified crops must be clear.
The Ministry of Agriculture sent a draft law on the transfer of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and amending the plant protection law to the coordination circle.
The amendment of the Act shall refrain from creating a separate database for both the locations of genetically modified (GM) crops as well as for actors, and will continue to use the plant health register.
In addition, the obligation of the GM agriculture operator to have an prior agreement with a person dealing with honey at the radius prescribed.
Although at the moment genetically modified crops are not cultivated in Estonia, we consider that there are clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least as long as it has not been decided to declare Estonia's GMO-free,” Sigmar Suu, Head of the Department of Plant Health, said.
"It must also be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account both the costs and administrative burdens associated with the private and public sector," the oral added.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the data collection of GMOVS crop locations and operators and to the training of the processing of GM crops, lays down requirements for the treatment of GM crops and for the establishment of economic activities.
In particular, as regards beekeeping, the obligation of the GM grower to inform beees of the start of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with a beekeeper prior to the start of the breeding.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to see this in the information system of drafts and, if desired, to present their opinion to the Ministry of Agriculture.
In particular, the proposed changes affect persons, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board in the field of plant education.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810 is allowed.
However, none of the Estonian farmers have been interested in growing GM crops.
The reason for the facts is that there is no maize in Estonia, a European strawberry plant for which MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this corn line have also been developed for southern regions, and this May is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture has ordered studies to detect potential GM organism pollution in the seeds of various varieties of summer rape, maize and soy.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the study concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soy varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that in Estonia, genetically modified crops are not consciously grown and also confirmed that there was no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu as a "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited a "genius" in the face of Nemanja Maticu after the middle field player Sampdori made his debut on Wednesday night.
For 40 million pounds over Chelsea, the player started in Dublin in the last seasonal game in United before Uefa Super Cupi Real Madrid on Tuesday in the 2-1 winning line, impressing on the defense force, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attacks.
However, after leaving Blues' seasonal Asian wind, Maticul was in need of a match form, and he only lasted 45 minutes. According to Mourinho, it has to improve it firmly before the Premier League season begins.
“He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, genial thinking – he has a football entertainment,” Mourinho said.
“We help him reach the form as soon as possible.”
As Matic, other newly recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also began in the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began to place one of their first men in the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club has already done a "great work" with three of its four priority options.
“I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three of the four,” he added.
"I'm even happier if they can do four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Once again, the son of a hairdryer came to the foot on GSM on August 1, and this time in Muhus.
According to Mati Martinson, the first bird observer in the ring got a ringboy equipped with the escort, and this nest is already flying around, leaving the base and joining the Great Nightquarters of Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because the Sword is not a fertility, the Sound of the Islands writes.
On this Tuesday, it was relatively late to ring the throats, and there was another gorgeous son on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of escorts is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
A bubble boy named Mati GSM was equipped with Swords in Turbulent.
“He’s doing his work on the Internet is all watching: how he went to Spain more winter, coming back for a while at the borders of Germany and Poland, and then came to Saaremaa,” Martinson said.
The British inventor lets you install a microchip in your body to get to the house and the car with a touch.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be installed with a microchip so that he could only open his front, get to the office and even start the car.
A 33-year-old Steven Northam allowed a small chip to be installed between his thumb and his name finger and now offers this service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with their technology.
He has combined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson of the Royal Hospital of Hampshire in Winchester in Hants to ensure that the installation procedure is consistent with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip to be installed on cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company also replaces the locks of houses and cars to match the chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married father has now installed technology in both home and car BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is in the wheel.
The White House Exponent went to taxpayers to pay thousands
According to the military documents published in TIME, the White House decided to fly the Navy helicopter last month to the South yard taxpayers for an event that celebrated American production last month.
The green and white color Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One during the president's boarding, was the central attraction number of the events of the American construction programs in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Higher officials of the White House, reported industrial products from all 50 states on their turn.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a hunt from Maine, a firefighting car from Wisconsin and a forks made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House's military cabinet required the helicopter's presence of the helicopter, or FARGO, for almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern yard for the "unusual" event.
“I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually significant event,” the commander of HMX-1 said the day before the event, in an e-mail to his commander, the deputy of the Navy’s commander in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter arrives at the southern courtyard on 17 July morning at 7 a.m. at 15 a.m. and stays there until the courtyard is cleaned between 18 and 21.
It was added that if leaving the White House should be stayed, a second ekipage is needed for return flights due to work time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the security team of the escatter stayed close to the aircraft throughout the time it was on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents given to the TIME magazine whether the second equipment eventually needed or not.
The Hatchi law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
Documents indicate that HMX-1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision.
“We asked if it violated Hatch’s law, and they told us not to violate,” wrote the commander.
“It turns out you have no choice,” replied the deputy officer.
The White House declared the event "made in America" as an official event, and the Hatch law would not cover it.
Even in official events, there are political subcontractions.
The President supported the efforts of the Health Reform during the Senate debate at that time and praised the efforts to keep government regulations under control.
The use of a aircraft under the name Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for a photo session is unusual.
Trump was given attention in February when his first campaign event in Florida in Melbourne rolled the background of the President's plane, and his Twitter account crawled out of messages that complain about how his predecessor used the President's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the presentation "American made", where the products were represented from all 50 states that have been manufactured by American workers from American materials," said Lindsay Walters, the White House press representative.
HMX-1 teams often perform experimental flights around Washington and on the southern yard to train the United States President's White House with a centimeter precision.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1, the White House held 58 attempts in the yard.
According to the official, the flight to the "American" flight team was considered to be a standard of the course of the course of the course of the month.
The Escatter helicopters also flew on that day for another 11 hours for "non-presidency support missions".
According to the White House, no other exhibitor of this event was burdening the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky’s representative, the company in the southern yard was not related to the organisation of exhibits.
HMX-1 does not maintain the president's budget documents and the exact costs arising from the event are difficult to determine.
However, according to the year 2017 of the Ministry of Defence, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24 380 per hour of flight.
The Escatter documents indicated the flight length of the main base of the Navy Quantico airport in both directions of Virginia 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is hardly below that amount.
"The calculation of the costs of payers based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated reimbursement rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include staff costs, but they cover the costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
The White House's former press representative, Sean Spicer, defended the use of a helicopter at the time of the event.
“The idea is to show things made this week in America,” Spicer said.
“And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of them to contribute to our national security and that there are probably hundreds of people, not even thousands, whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have been working on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it.”
It’s not clear if Trump touched a helicopter in the southern yard during the event, but he sat behind the firefighting car’s steering wheel.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky turned to representatives, throwing a joke about the company’s products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - through the tears arrived in peace and joy
In the 2011 MM Daegu, Šadeiko was hit in the last area, 800 metres running a foot ramp, and the stadium was taken away with a canderam.
Right before that, he had received zero in a distance jump in China.
In 2012, the Helsinki EM was damaged by the injuries, but at the debutolympia held in London, he received a position of 23 in 6013.
However, the misfortune continued.
After the opening day of the 2013 Moscow MM, the Estonian record had a distant jump in the Estonian record chart.
Two years later, he received a 15th position in Beijing’s MM and met the Olympic norm, but this was more than what he wanted to disappoint the athlete.
Shadeiko only passed the hardest catalogue in the soil if he was not able to get a letter in the Amsterdam EM at the beginning.
I just want to put together a fair multi-contest once or again.
One time, Shadeiko confessed.
The worse was ahead: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio broke out due to a thickness.
It was time to take off - do you want to continue with seven competitions at all?
Is two days of effort worth all this?
She thought long, but found peace in herself.
I got my head cleaned.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, it was time to cure and think clean.
“I knew I didn’t put the pill in the bag yet,” Shadeiko said about his self-cleaning.
I had to turn the clean page and go on with a new moment.
According to coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the sufferings of the cared, but he realized that the athlete himself had to find out.
He was so buried on all sides.
It was hard to endure.
“Grit said he wouldn’t give up and he wants to prove to himself what he’s worth,” says Mägi.
Now there is some kind of peace in him.
He's doing it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set up a new Estonian record 6280 points at the Götzis multi-verse.
During a high-level competition, he improved his personal top-mark shot with nearly a meter (13.89) and runs the blockage of records close to time.
Then, a multi-contester felt that it was not the ceiling of the power, but that it was erased only the primary exhibition of the race.
The mountain who taught him for years says Shadeiko is a pattern student.
He's an athlete, it's good to train him.
If something's wrong or something's wrong, he'll say it right away.
He feels his own body and trusts his feelings.
That's what we need to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and follow it.
A new approach has also been found in Shadeiko.
“I’m not the one who does the maximum in practice,” he says, and he says, that the most important thing is getting the right feeling is because it also guarantees a good result.
The baby’s happiness of the closest makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko the happiness of loved ones.
Her former coach Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-contester has received support from new world citizens.
“It’s been interesting,” says Shadeiko.
One alcohol that drinks is equal to the brain 'training'.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes - wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscient at Yale University.
His words are not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather in the "very active" wine taste process.
By sniffing the glass, sniffing wine in the mouth, enjoying it and perceiveing the after taste, we make our brain work to create a taste for wine.
Sheperd said that wine molecules actually do not contain taste, but the taste arises from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares how the brain “sees” colors.
"There is no taste in wine, it creates a taste of wine," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the taste of wine are our age, gender, and even the amount of spices that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, warns that wine is not to drink.
"There must be more in practice," he says.
If you're taking too big, the system's overwhelming.
Excessive wine drinking can cause harm to the brain instead of benefits - according to the 2004 study, people who drink over three glasses of wine, memory loss, balance loss and reduced mental capacity are risking.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector get less salaries from colleagues
The information in Fontes reveals that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector will receive less salaries from colleagues.
The ten percent pay gap is between men and women, the portal is written by Genesis.
59 IT and telecommunication companies were involved in the Font ICT sector’s wage survey.
Overall, there were under 8 577 posts.
63% of posts worked by men.
"Although only 3 companies stated that the pay difference is for men and that the remaining companies say there is no pay difference, then, in reality, the main wage of the month of men is an average of 10% higher than the average wage for women and the total annual wage for men," said the Fontese analyst in the North.
"Narcose" Semester 3 Advertisement Clip: Now that Pablo Escobar has gone, the Netflix hit series will enter the center of Cali cartel
Despite the fact that Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season, the Netflix series has not ended far.
The third and fourth season has been confirmed by the transmission service, and the first of them has already been completed by an advertising clip that stirs the series with new illusions.
In the third season, DEA pays attention to the world’s richest drug business organization - Cali cartel.

According to the United Nations, it depends on the role of women in politics in Afghanistan.
On Wednesday, the Head of the UN Afghanistan Mission said that elections can represent the people only if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of UN Assistant Mission, said that hundreds of women are candidates in local council elections, three women are candidates as Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“It is not possible to overthrow the role of women in stressing the importance,” he said in the statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent and be credible only if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections and presidential elections of the local councils of Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
On its part, the Taliban has threatened the electoral process, which coincides with the transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year’s elections will celebrate for the first time when the power will be given peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that women play a strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent electoral committee of Afghanistan, 1.2 million women are registered from 3.6 million voters.

From the philippines to the heart of the moefants in a wide world or Oil Home
Bags from oils are a summer class, which has become a separate hit product in recent years, which one of the right souvenirs has to hang onto the end of the hand and which traders have been able to weld the price label according to the hit, despite its modest origin.
The purse of oils is probably one of those things that have existed for every time in life and whose possession has not caused special emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, the shoulder bags are making a true race, and the fashion fans have changed their fine design decots for summer months, instead, against simple shoulders.
This is not just a beach bag, but it is also popular today as a street bag, and the bravest women walk to the office.
However, it is worth making it clear before it is necessary to make sure that such a summer look to the boss is still sitting or worth a wet, and the laptop is a little more formal to sumadan.
The exchange of shoulders, however, have made women’s true summer love.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing remains to be seen is that the fashiongurans bring their holiday trip to the local market as the first thing to do and buy a shoulder bag to which they are faithful throughout the holiday period and are accompanied by the beach, the market, and the friends on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous to buy bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
In this regard, it is worth noting that among the readers, the demand for bags is so large that women (and men!) are likely to go to each other in the real world to become a happy owner of a bag.
In some respects, such a madness is also understandable, because these times are rare when some of the things in the fashion world can be purchased for just a fewty euros.
In fact, smart traders have also discovered a simple money service option here and so the finer luxury brands sell beer bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Apparently, richer customers should not feel plainly mortal who promote some cheap bags around.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana over a thousand euros paid shoulder bag.
However, Chanel’s shoulder bag interpretation can be made around EUR 6,000.
Unlike most fashions, the shoulders do not come from some large fashions, but their story became more remote.
In fact, the shoulder bags are supposed to be far from the Philippines, where they have been carried without a wide range.
Drinking the shoulder bag is especially an ex-poor business, and locals are not often seen around them.
According to the 14th century, the beer bumping technique is quite similar to the usual basket.
However, because the shoulder bag doesn’t have to pour as strongly as a basket, they can stick patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and more attractive.
For example, in recent times, there are particularly trendy bags that have been poured in colorful ribbons or leather strips.
Thanksgiving bags may, in particular, be sent to actress Jane Birkin, who had not seen the biggest puffed shoulder bags before.
In other words, he matched the shoulder bag with all possible clothing sets and didn’t even have much to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
At the popularity of the bags today, however, it is also not a minor role that cares for them is a skullhead, and, unlike all other sumadans, it is not necessary to maintain them with special means, but it is also a water and a wet towel.
As in the case of trends, after classical appearance brands have come out with all possible interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can acquire a strawberry or a tiny shoulder.
However, it is worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag will never go out of fashion, but on the shoulder.
But, what is the classical shoulder bag?
For centuries, such a strawberry bag, which reminds of its style of basket, has been considered classic, is open and is short, as well as strawberries, sangs.

GMB is concerned about investment in McVitie's Glasgow Factory
The company expects a confirmation from McVitie's manufacturers of cookies on long-term production plans at the Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company is silent about the future of the investment of the Tollcross object.
In a factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products are produced, more than 500 people work.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they have invested the object over 5 million pounds in the last few years.
They hired employees and trade union presidents "the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's activity.
In a letter sent to the company's object manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie to "resolve concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines".
GMB's senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we are not able to get a clear understanding of the business needs of Tollcross and the investment plan for the future, makes our members deeply concerned.
There have been several generations of families, and the workforce is largely composed of the local community and the people around Glasgow, being essential to ensure more proper employment in the region where there is high unemployment and dominates social weather.
Therefore, Glasgow needs a firm with a strongly growing production in McVitie in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part and the rise in Brexit, the cost of living and the growth of production."
The representative of the plastic said: “The object manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company responds directly to him because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago there was a regular meeting between employees in Tollcross and GMB representatives, which opened up a number of problems.
We then discussed with our employees that, like all other firms operating in a very competitive and insecure economic climate, we are looking at our activities in a running way - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds of Tollcross object, most of it has gone into production lines and the improvement of operations.
We fully understand the heritage of Tollcross as a production object, and if any changes in the activity of the object should occur, employees and representatives of the trade union are the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up on attempts to attract Neymar into its lines, making an offer of 189 million pounds to buy it. But did they warn Barcelona about this recording trip three years ago?
This disgusting approach has opened a summer transition window and the League 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of overpurchasing, which was set up last season by Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million.
When the transition is completed, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world who will start to pay more than 500 000 pounds per week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is known to be angry because of both the way of approach and the break-off of Neymar, although the source close to the Catalans Board confirms that the club has always taken the best care for the footballer since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
But did the President of the PSG warn the football world about such a possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in concluding a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strictly warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of the best players in PSG.
"I don't worry, because they know that if they touch some of our players, we'll come back to them and contact these players," said Al-Khelaif.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to make a deal with some of our players, they must face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this border, as the Spanish club previously showed interest in this summer by the PSG middle field player Marco Verratt.
The PSG made it clear that they would not let the Italian leave any condition and that Barcelona would be able to get backwards as a result of this interest, losing one of its expensive assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit threatens to severely defeat the gap between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Vardkar warned the first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
“I can’t imagine who would benefit from it,” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of current people and goods, said Varadkar.
“This is our vision for the future: build bridges, not borders,” he stressed.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer to remain part of the European Union, and since it is not possible, he would remain part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The second way to make the UK’s departure more smooth would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Prime Minister of Ireland.
Having noted that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Vardkar said, "We could have such an agreement with the United Kingdom."
The alternative to this would be to return to customs stations that would declare historical fragmentation and political failure.
"Fight to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Prime Minister of Ireland.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its result could affect every aspect of the everyday life of Northern Ireland.
The Prime Minister of Ireland met Belfast by visiting the main leaders of Northern Ireland.
The first half-long triathlon through the March Avandi: everyone can pass Ironman.
Today, the largest triathlon festival of the Baltics was held in the winter capital Otepää, when the half-piece Ironman competitions were located about 1,000 triathletes from over thirty countries.
The distance of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of bike and 21.1 km of bike.
Among others, Mart Avandi also finished the first triathlon of his life.
“I thought it would be complicated and finally it was complicated,” Avandi said.
Despite the complexity, Avandi stated that the triathlon is effective for everyone.
"Not the distance kills, but the tempo kills," he said, suggesting that with a valid pace, everyone reaches the final head.
Except Ott Sepp: “The physicist is fine, but he can’t swim.”
Avandi had been training since February.
At the beginning of 4-5 hours a week, and then ten hours a week.
During 05:34:12, he reached 270 in general.
Although Avandi lost both to Raio Border (Age 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (Age 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominent class" fighters.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost a good example to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The general winner of the Otepää stage of the Ironman series was crowned by the German Johannes Moldan at 3:58:27; the Estonians were the best Ivo in the Great Time 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Danube Helle Frederis won 04:24:01, but the Estonians, Maria Rabbit, who lost Frederkseni in almost half an hour and received 04:58:58.
The opening went through a swim distance of 1.9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in position 410.
