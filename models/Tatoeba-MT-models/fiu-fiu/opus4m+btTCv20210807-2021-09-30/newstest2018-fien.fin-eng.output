Camille Auer wanted to fix his sex, diagnosed as mentally ill, and now he makes art about the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body."
The roof of the Project Room Academy of Arts hangs ten patient reports.
Each of them says Camille Auer's name.
Papers tell a multi-year story about how external people have written up their interpretation of Auer and its identity.
Decided for him who he is.
“I wanted to tell a person about my treatment history so that the violence of the process would be visible,” says Auer.
With the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a years of study that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts by sending the diagnosis studies of "sugar-identity disorder" conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen that he ordered through the Internet and had been very long in his own repair process.
He felt that he was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person has to go through a repair process so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
Transact, i.e. the law transsek on strengthening the gender of the mouth (563/2002), obliges transsex-sex people to forced sterilization in order to get the right sex into, for example, the population register centre and passport.
Currently, every gender remedial requires psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of reproductive inability.
People have the right to decide their own body.
“This situation is unbearable and violates human rights,” says Auer.
Transformation has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations in law and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to comply with the right of self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared the amendment of the law under the leadership of the Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
There were elections and the Finnishs went up to the government.
Now the change of law is stuck again.
This is an internal policy dispute that does not even relate to this law.
"The administration does not want to raise it to the table because there are disagreements within the government to amend the law," says Frank Johansson, CEO of the Finnish Department of Amnesty.
The front part of the exhibition space is controlled by two large installations.
One of these consists of the packs and instructions for use of the medicinal products used by Auer.
In the patient’s report, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpolic psychologist of the University of Tampere Hospital from Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and, on the basis of these, wrote a report that should define the treatment of Auer's law and the provision of assistance.
The consciousness of exploring reality appears to be a susceptible to deterioration.
The exploratory understanding of itself appears to be fragmented and the instability of personality is highlighted.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," Auer said.
Even more shocked when Auer was not given gender repair treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpolis waiting hall on TV.
Later, this television was created by a works of art called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
“It’s crazy that any person defined as a woman in birth can increase their breasts, but to remove breasts needs a diagnosis,” Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you experience anything other than the amount of your sex specified in your birth.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not the only quality.
The gender repair process is harder for many mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Its people meet tens of people who need to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, begging that their resources are not enough,” Auer says.
Many people applying for the process have psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, potential temptation experiences.
Inviting them, the care staff may order that treatment cannot be initiated.
“Avoiding care and help can lead a person to a worse situation than it was before the process began,” Auer says.
Auer’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: “I have had self-destructive thoughts throughout my adulthood and that’s what people are usually hard to melt.”
Depression has been treated with drugs, and when Auer started using hormones, the feeling became easier.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and teenage age.
Why the wide jaw didn’t feel suitable for its own body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people near him who see him.
Being a vision is a fundamental goal.
“The man has to reason so much by speaking, dressing, using voice and moving,” he says.
Nowadays, Auer feels he's coming to see, he exists as a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, the incidental comments of the closest could hurt a lot.
It hurts most when close relatives mismatch.
“They should know and they know who I am, but they won’t agree or be able to internalize it,” he continues.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, i.e. body conflict, where the body or its parts may cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, it is not possible to obtain official confirmation for its own sex.
“There are no medical grounds for these studies,” Auer says.
And that's true.
For example, in Denmark, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on self-determination right in relation to legal sex.
A full-aged applicant shall make a written application for a new identity, stating that it will experience a different gender.
After six months of consideration, the applicant shall ratify its application in writing and the Ministry shall grant the applicant a new identity ID.
This right of self-determination is also required for Finland and this requirement is also subject to the exhibition of Auer.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for an artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can lead to political changes during the time that politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organization gave travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP Organization of African American Civil Rights has provided travel warnings for Missour, which are due to the state's discriminatory practices and racist attacks.
"The travel newsletter of the NACP Missouri will enter into force on 28 August7, and calls on African American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to follow extreme caution when travelling to a state which has recently had numerous suspicious events based on races," the Organization's Communication states.
The recent law in Missouri makes it difficult for the export of discrimination cases to the right, and the enforcement of state laws is disproportionately targeted by minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the provision of travel warning.
Human rights are violated.
They are stopped on the basis of skin color and are assaulted or killed,” said the NAACP Missouri President Rod Chapel on Kansas City Star.
“We haven’t heard one of many cases in one short time.”
The Missouri travel newsletter is the first warning to the US state.
The organization mentioned, for example, racist comments against African American students at Missouri University and from Tennessee, the death of the 28-year-old Black Tory Sanders.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and Missouri's police arrested him, even though he was not accused of a crime.
The Travel Notice also referred to the report by the Minister of Justice of Missouri that the police would stop the black driver by 75% more likely than the white driver.
“The purpose of the Travel Communication is to encourage people to be alert and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri,” Chapel says.
“People must prepare, for example, by taking money to pay guarantees or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, in 2015, a hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixteen most of the U.S. states.
Travel warning is also an answer to Missouri’s new law, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge their rights in housing and employment.
ACLU recently provided travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws that obligated police to arrest people from immigration violations.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and are concerned with other states, but recently, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair to report on the additional pension of the CEO
Minister of Commercial Administration Mika Lintilä (kesk.) has requested Finnair to report the additional pension fee received by the airline CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
According to the minister, it is inconsistent with the State's statement of will.
The additional pension received by Vauramo increased this week when Helsinki’s Sanomat news about the reward development of the managers of the stock exchange companies.
The Finnish Film Magazine news about Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said he would give up extra pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that no additional pensions are used for rewarding.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the last year's decision on ownership management.
The constraints immediately hardened speeches.
A while ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
During the G20 meeting in Hamburg, President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of the United States appeared to be a great deal.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled significantly.
The new economic sanctions signed by the United States Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were rigorously responded in Russia.
The most disgusting answer has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which Trump's signature was a "full trade war".
Although Russian reactions would only be disqualified as the tops and overlyings of political retoric, the excitement between the United States and Russia is the fact that after the short post-election of Trump.
In the United States, it was not easy to pass through the Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
However, the Congress accepted the law as a significant unanimity, but the adoption of the law to the President was much more difficult.
Trump criticizes the law that he has recently signed as "incomplete".
President Trump must have been responsible for the crispness in particular for Russia, although the adoption of a law restricting his own powers must also have been disgusting.
As well known, investigations are conducted in the United States on the possible involvement of Russia in the presidential elections and on the Russian relations of the Trump campaign.
The excitement between the United States and Russia is a fact after the short month of honey.
When the White House staff has switched into a thick and various scandal-driven translations have been revealed almost to update, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy in the United States is not under the leadership of the President but despite the president.
Such a situation is certainly not desirable.
If Russia is a turbulent in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the excitement of the security situation in the Union's core region in the Baltic Sea also tightens relations.
The EU has seen the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Treaty.
Although the Union has remained at least on the main side of its policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that trades a lot with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been real.
The impact of the U.S. recent sanctions is still unclear.
It is feared in the EU that sanctions will make the operation of many European companies more difficult.
In Finland, for example, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project can have the impact.
Oxidity in Europe has caused the absence of sanctions, for example, a liquid natural gas in lng for the US economy.
Commercial sanctions are the means of global policy to demonstrate deterioration.
However, economic sanctions must be very thoughtful and accurate.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than useful.
Is nothing holy anymore?
Trump's White House now has a Freedom Sculpture
The lack of statutes is surely a sign of power exchange.
The Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, were killed in the Firdos Square of Saddam Hussein in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideas of Trump’s administration, knew well what was going on in a intense debate with the CNN channel Jim Acostan.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of cruise organizers and immersed characters from the Freedom statue.
His attack was subjected to the significance of the statue, and in particular the fact that in 1903 his statue was added to Emma Lazarus’ poem – 17 years after his completion.
In this way, Miller radiated Acosta: “I don’t want to go further into history, but the Sculpture of Freedom is a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the whole world.
The poem was later added, and it is not part of the original statue of Freedom.”
Miller was not wrong, but it's not just about history, as he said.
Important are the words of Lazarus, the only of their quality, where the state calls not only immigrants, but also the "poor poorest": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeting shore."
The poem is now more up-to-date than ever.
Miller did not practice literary criticism, but he made it clear that the poorest poorest people are not welcome to Trump's United States.
The debate on the importance of the Freedom Sculpture is part of a wider political and cultural debate on the importance of the United States.
Lazarus’ friends campaigned after his death for poetry to be attached to his footsteps. They knew that the act was strongly political.
The statue was designed to manifest the links between French and American Republic through a classical symbol, a feminine emblem of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female man is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the exiled mother.
The linking of the poem to the image was a genius feminist revolution and a destructive attack against the American National Act.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh, an instructor, which can now be regarded as some kind of predictive sign of Trump, claimed in 2010 that the Freedom Sculpture does not appear to be invited to anyone, but is the early pioneer of the New Conservatives, which takes the United States to the darkness to cover the world: "Lady Liberty appears.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States."
Of course, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of the statue of freedom depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship’s deck after a long and tested journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for a better life.
His Son of Freedom comforts by giving hope and welcome.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want.
Their soil does not show the way, but lays the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
MM competitions in general sport 2017: Neil Black praises Scotland members of the UK National Team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scotches got into the UK country team
The British Sports Union’s CEO Neil Black says that 16 members of the World Championship team are a "significant confirmation".
On Friday, a number of Scotland athletes have been selected for the MM competitions in London.
According to Black, "There is something special going on in Scotland," which UK general sports need to learn.
“This is welcome, and we continue to study it for so long that we understand what’s going on,” Black says.
“I studied with the representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sports, and they thought it was related to the operation of the Institute.
The Scottish Association of Sports believes that it is related to the operation of the Union,
And the UK General Sports Union believes that it has their activities.
And the usual streetkeeper thinks he has something to do with it.
But this is something really great, why is it?"
Many Scots are competing in London with medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the race of 5,000 metres. Eilidh Doyle, on the other hand, was elected captain of the country team.
"Eilidh is uncomfortable.
His captain's speech was incredibly amazing," Black says.
“The sportsmen left the opportunity proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they live and practice.
There was a real feeling and passion for sports in Eilidh’s words.”
Eilidh Doyle is the championship championship of the National Community in the 400 metres of fence, and these are his fifth World Championships. He thinks it's "incredible" that the country team has 16 Scotts.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
The middle traveler Laura Muir has run five British and two European records over the year.
He competes in London at 1 500 metres and 5 000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 metres in London. He is also worth keeping an eye on him: a man has an excellent season behind him, including winnings in UK MMs and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship, when the only Scot was Lee McConnell.
The team's captain says he's "very proud" of the fact that there are so many Scotlands involved, some of which really compete with the final places and medals.
“It’s a great honor to access to Captain, but it’s even more special because the members of the country team voted for the captain,” says Doyle.
“I am, of course, very proud of all the Scots who got into the country team.
It shows how far we've gotten.
They are among the earned athletes who compete for awarders.
Captain's speech?
I think it was all right.
I focused on how lucky we are when we have home races.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home public and that we are at the Olympic Stadium again.
I get another chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be incredibly amazing."
Abuse of critics on Facebook: Do not qualify for public office if you do not endure criticism
Our father knew what was a bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him from all possible domestic policies to his political principles.
Critics must be annoying,
But he did not silence his critics.
“If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led by foolish and quietly as sheep were slaughtered,” Washington said in 1783.
That's where we get to Maryland's governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their players.
The U.S. Civil Rights Association challenged Hogan's court in the past this week.
His staff considered the challenge unfounded, and their attitude was decreasing also online.
“What does it matter? This is just Facebook,” many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the astonishingly popular Republican governor of the state of democracy.
He has received the second best estimates of his activities among 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to the hot fish.
He has led the state firmly and firmly in line with the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main communication channel to his voters and published a picture of his head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, the prevention of users coming to the Governor’s Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor’s page is a public and official forum that his staff maintains with tax resources.
Hogan’s reporter Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s action in his interview with Washington Post. He said it was just about the moderation of comments.
However, it is too easy to stamp commenters as trolls, spärs or haters.
Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to discuss with the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors.
They told me that their comments were respectful, kind and appropriate.
The Pastor quoted the Bible in his comment; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic faith of Hogan.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland’s Bowie was not hostile, but asked a question of anger crimes.
“I said complimentfully that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a position on anger crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in Washington Post’s comments.
“I cannot accept the fact that when more people comment on the same thing, they are considered to be a sort of organized group and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.”
The governor's staff called comments as a "central attack". Someone else could call them the most important things to promote.
During Facebook’s era communications, it is easy to manage by blocking a critic or removing a critical comment.
Prior to the old, you should have sent the staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical headlines, or arrest and silence protesters.
However, it is the same thing, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have challenged him.
The first important decision was made last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria’s Judge James C. Cacheris, the government of the Loudoun County violated the first addition of the U.S. Constitution in preventing the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Association was discussing the use of Twitter and Facebook with the Republican Governor, Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be hard.
During Washington, cheap postal payments had the same effect as today on the Internet.
The number of newspapers fourfolded from 1776 to 1800, and unnamed writers mocked Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
The names of Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius were written in the newspapers in which they hailed Washington’s decisions.
The president’s office flooded petitions that criticised the Jay Agreement, i.e. the U.S. Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, which reflects the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Free speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of conversation are the basic stones of our nation.
Real leadership means acceptance of this fact.
The summer food of birds should be stopped immediately
The samples have come from about half a decade of locations, and in addition to online statements from two, three.
Most of them have become South and Warsaw Finland, but then the individual from Haapaved and Seinäjoki, specialist researcher Marja Isomursu Evira.
The green peppers have died of tricomonosis.
It is caused by a scientifically called Trichomonas Gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit the cereals, and especially the pussy.
However, in the 2000s, the disease was also detected in pedestrian birds.
In 2009, it was very stunning.
At that time, tricomonosis caused a large collapse in the Finnish green pepper stock, after which the strains of the species have been revival.
There have now been sick green peppers, but at least not in a large scale, the Museum of Natural Science at the University of Helsinki (Luomus) says.
It is fearful that the previous epidemic of green peppers will be recurring if nothing is done.
What you need to do now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop the birds’ summer food immediately.
More about this later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantages at Renaissance Club
The first player in Europe, Ronan Rafferty, hopes to benefit from home field promotions for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in Eastern Lothian, hosts a 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Last year, Rafferty, the North Irelandian, led a tournament in the Neighbourhood of Archerfield Links before the last round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has a new place and works as an ambassador for the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will be filled with its glory,” Rafferty says.
"The players will see the field at their best, and it's in a great condition.
Jerry has done great work with this place.
He is an enthusiastic ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a fantastic event for this field."
The English Eales defends the championship for the first time, even though he has won his 32-year career for both the European tour and the European Championship.
“This feels like a really special opportunity,” says the player in Southport.
“I couldn’t defend Extremadura Open’s victory because the tournament is not part of this year’s tour.
It's great to get back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time we will always remember.”
Gary Orr will come back to real action with his own soil, and he went to the tour after filling 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
“Playing in home is always more relevant,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played pretty strongly.
I am pleased with my game so far."
Triple will follow the field with the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the seniors' major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament is held by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs five pounds if the car only has a driver, and 10 pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All earnings are donated to the Prostate Cancer UK Cancer Organization.
There were some indoor problems in the room.
At the bedside of the Pori Brigade of Communications Companies, there have been no internal air problems yet, the Brigade was reported on Thursday.
Indoor air studies will continue.
The studies began when a man who suspended his service for health reasons thought his health was weakened because of the bad indoor air of the barracks.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, the Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigadier General, there were no problems in the health situation of other guardians.
It turns out that it was an individual case, and no other service providers had any health problems.
Every statement is taken seriously and we wanted to settle this in a thorough way.
It is currently not known that we have an internal air problem, Holma says.
The Brigadier’s news says that due to the July arrival, the barracks must have been moved to the barracks, which could result in a momentary increase in dust.
That's why the air might seem intact, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Republic of Indonesia
Bardina Degei does not use the charm of his cooking plant.
He's rarely using a caterpillar.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital city of Pania, located in the Indonesian restorating Papua province. When he prepares a dinner, he usually put a batat – locally “nota” – directly in the fire.
After half an hour, the batt burned on the carrel will be eaten greedyly with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Degei’s home. He sits on a mud painting, where he usually cares for his daily askares, such as washing in the same water applied for from a nearby sculpture.
The office of the bathroom is provided by a bucket in the roof room.
Degei is the youngest of the four wives of his husbands and has not been ordered to treat the fields.
Multiple marriage is common here.
Later work can be dangerous: most of the village’s men are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, the soldiers need to be taken into account.
“No one dares to walk in the village after five nights,” Degei says.
This is a rare cucumber on the ark in the top of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was associated with Indonesia in 1969. The accession was preceded by a controversial referendum, in which 1 026 village jury price was forced to vote publicly in front of the occupational forces.
The local autonomy movement opposed the Dutch power quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta government, which strictly manages the area and prevents foreign suppliers and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and West Pope. The east part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is remote and slope. The trip to the province starts a half hour flight from the main town of Jayapura to Nabire and continues on a five-hour drive to the stomach by the rental car.
There's no public transport here.
In the city of about 19,000 inhabitants, there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo plants whose wavelengths have been stacked into bell browns.
Only few Indonesians have been here, without talking about journalists and foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries came to Papua Mee Pago, the tribes worshipped the God of Uga Tamee.
Other changes have happened.
"We didn't have such clothes," Degei says. He means a colorful, hand-woven with his twisted head, dark ink and bright ink.
Before we had only leaves covered by our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia. 28% of its inhabitants live below the poverty limit, and child mortality and literacy are the highest in Asia.
But it is also the golden country of Indonesia.
Paniai is about 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey. Only 100 kilometers from Pania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine. It owns the Freeport McMoran company, which is located in Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the mine produced 3.3 billion dollars of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated 78 billion dollars of wood reserves.
However, these wealths bring miserableness to the Papuans, as they mean the suppressing presence of the strong army of Indonesia.
New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and military local units in 1998-2004.
The demands of Papua for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are silent.
According to human rights activists, after 1969, the Indonesian army has killed over 500 000 paps and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass deaths at the top of the Papua tribes in the 1970s were proportional to genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3 900 people in the area in peaceful demonstrations.
The Brisbane Archbishop report We Will Lose Everything from 2016 has reports of the cruelties of the last year, such as executions without trial, torture - rapes and electrical attacks are particularly popular means - and unpleasant attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"The calculation of the number of victims is difficult because there are cases per week," says Indonesian researcher Andreas Harsono, the Human Rights Watch organization.
Ruuvia has been extorted when Papua’s natural resources attract migrants from other countries of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of Provins, 83% are Christians, but the population structure is changing when the islands of Japan, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawes are moving Muslims to the region in the hope of better success.
Jaavalaiset warung dishes sell fried chicken and gado-gado-violence in the peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"Moderns have started selling chickens and vegetables on the market with cheaper prices than locals," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old, from Pania and moved to the capital of the province after work.
"The local women lost their customers."
In Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Jokowi, promised to address the injustices and human rights violations of Papua in the 2014 election campaign.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former wooden sleeve won the vote in 27 regions, including in Pania, on his way to Jakarta’s presidential Castle.
But just a little has changed in Papua, and locals feel disappointed.
“Our hearts were broken because we voted in 2014, and we expected that he would fulfill our wishes and restore justice,” says You.
Pania had a kind of wave base for only two months after Jokow's logical postures.
The 11 children were singing Christmas songs near the fire at Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers didn't like the comment. According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned to the place with four soldiers.
According to the reports of victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers caught the children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot for children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A couple of hours later, the building of the State Election Board near the event was fired, and the next day it began to happen.
Approximately a thousand papuans — young men and women and children — gathered on the football field to the local police station and military command center to demand the right.
They were accompanied by hunting springs for celebrations, and they began to present the traditional wait dance of the Papuan Mee Pago family, where they danced around and tracked the bird song.
Some of the demonstrators began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got warm, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: “If the crowds do more than three times of resistance, shoot them dead.” The information is based on the official document seen by the TIME magazine, which has not been published to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the resident director of Kego Koto area, devastated the situation to get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left shore," he told the TIME magazine with a shiny color painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' rows.
"There were several shots in the Venezuela."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure that it was really him," Yohanes TIME said as sad. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Inspector Yotje Mende, Papua, told journalists that the police were just "protecting" police station because it was under attack.
“We need to defend when people threaten to kill us,” said Pudjo Sulistiyo, Papua police reporter in 2015.
“Then it’s about life and death.”
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many were injured.
The data on the deaths came to Jakara the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi spoke emotionally in Jayapur, in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua would be addressed.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that the case will never happen again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch reports of human rights violations outside the legal system.
But he started to revoke his speech right away.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate infringements, but it requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he was not going to start exploring on Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he said.
The United Nations blames Wiranto on crimes against humanity. Crimes are linked to more than a thousand deaths in the Ida-Timor's blood-independence vote in 1999. Wiranto said to the TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including events in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania are disbeliefly disbeliefed.
“I have been interviewed four times in the past three years, but things have not progressed in any way,” Yohanes says.
"I'm tired of this."
He says he's still alive in fear, even though it's been years.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the panians are not dared to discuss the event.
He says the soldiers had assaulted him when he had helped to bury four victims.
“The soldiers are looking for me after the funeral of the victims,” he says.
Shooting isn't over.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the Neighbourhood of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 was injured in the conflict between the villagers and the building company’s leader, which began when the leader refused to take the man who lost his consciousness to the hospital.
The man who needed hospital treatment was 24 years old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in the water while fishing in a nearby river. He died on his way to the hospital.
In front of the company’s office, the hostile villagers showed their minds at the construction site.
According to the police, the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
According to local authorities, however, the mobile police department of the Indonesian military police opened fire towards the crowd, where one villager was killed.
"We're terrified. We're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyai Parliament has called for gunshots to be fired by the police and to withdraw the police unit from the area.
Paniai has always been the problem of the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds unsatisfactory in the Mee, Multi-, Dani- and Damal tribes that live in Papua's wheat middle mountains.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), the Rebel Army, claiming to defend the rights of the Papuans by random attacks and the kidnapping of the Indonesian army.
Some of the OPM leaders are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The Army has responded to its revolt by arresting and arbitrary arresting thousands of people in Pania in the name of "securing national sovereignty".
Some of the arrested will never come back.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as "happy, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discomfort.
There is only a little rice for sale in the Enarotal, and it is too expensive for locals,
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly bats and some fruits and leaves.
Cultivation is women’s work, and one woman’s responsibility may be four or five bats.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold on the market.
Ten bats cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences in local and migrant performance have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened to Nabire airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to local better trained and wealthier migrants.
Only a few papals have sufficient capital and skills to operate their own business competitively.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there’s no work or money here,” says Paniai’s tribe council president John Gobai.
Scary Papua will be a little attention in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news are still strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been given a rare description permit.
According to Phelim Kiinen, the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his electoral promises. He has not increased transparency and has promoted development by removing restrictions on news.
“Indonesia’s most relaxing eastern provinces of Papua and Western Pope have new risks: refusing a visa and getting on a black list,” Kine said in his opinion.
The lack of freedom of operation of the press means that the Indonesian government is only pressured by the neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "local and widespread infringements" in Papua, including the Pania shooting attack.
These countries have traditionally supported Papua’s release movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, an informant of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonsia is still a democracy with the freedom of press, so it would be difficult to cover evidence of human rights violations."
The locals want foreign governments to be involved.
When the Dutch official delegation led by Kees Van Bar of Human Rights visited Jayapura on 4.5.2017, the locals broke silence and expressed their desire for freedom, an anonymous source involved in the meeting.
In Indonesia has presidential elections in 2019, but the priests say that they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have been confused with the Pania shooting attack," says Gobai, Chairman of the tribe council.
She wants Jokow to know the situation of the panic: they live under the power of the monkey and unpredictable army in the lack and poverty, practically without health care and training opportunities.
According to Goba, the panians, like the rest of the priests, hold the voices given to Jokow as “debted” which must be paid back.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and frightening, the victims of the Palestinian shooting attack once again showed the resistance symbolically: they buried one of the victims in the police station and the military office in the opposite country.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they will not let the responsible forget their crimes.
"My family members were killed," Yacobus says the head in the paintings.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora calls for the cancellation of Robert Helenius' replay: "Even their fans don't want to see you."
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were to fight in Hartwall on 27 May.
However, the match was withdrawn for commercial reasons.
In the recent IFL TV interview, Chisora plunges the reason for floating the replay on Helenius's shoulders.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's bad, Chisora's boring.
Helenius and Chisora first met in the full Hartwall area in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial point sentence.
The ticket sales went smoothly, and its promotional engine Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match was moved to autumn.
There was nothing new about the match.
Chisora will no longer be harmed by resignation.
In any case, the match would have had to be reversed after Chisora was ill.
On Thursday, three days before the time of the match, I woke up into severe pain.
My tyre was exploding.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora says.
Britti says he's in about 45% condition right now.
He is not interested in the reunion match with Helenius, but is aimed at Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whyte in December.
The fire reproduced the Torch cloudmaker in Dubai
The flames captured the world’s highest-reading residential building in Dubai on Friday, and hundreds of people were forced to escape from 337 meters from a high 79-story building.
This was already a second fire within two years of the building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptyed and no one is known to have been injured.
“We were sleeping and awakening the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs on the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," George's resident told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Rescue Authorities, the extinguishing forces were fired at four o’clock in the morning and remained cooling the building.
The government announced that he would arrange accommodation for those who left his home.
The case may again raise questions about the safety of materials used in high buildings outside the world.
After the fire of 2015, the Board of the Torch building carried out a study that found that the most damage was caused by discs used for the screening and insulation of the facade.
In the UK, the police believe that London's Grenfell Tower insulation and curtain plates could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.

In the United States, more than 20% of air travellers take prohibited objects into the machine, reveals surveys
The survey conducted by air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had taken prohibited objects consciously or unaware of the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA) inspection points. At least 6% of passengers had knives or other steel objects that they didn’t know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said they were only later informed that they had carried weapons, ammunition or explosives in error.
The survey responded to more than a thousand passengers and carried out by the Stratos Jet Charters ordering airline, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
19.7% of passengers who were aware of the TSA rules were members of the Y generation and less than 15% belonged to the X generation.
The most common rules were broken by taking food and fluids into the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted that he was aware of the aeroplane, and that 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said he was consciously taking prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States. The company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many had accidentally taken the smuggling goods and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most travellers are also most likely to pass the security check – consciously or without knowing.
But, as the company inquires, the TSA’s instructions are quite complex and confusional.
Passengers often don’t know what fluids can be taken into the aircraft and how much.
It is not surprising that most of the TSA's confiscations are liquids.
For some time, there was also a thought that there should be no books on the plane.
Liquids can be taken for domestic flights but not for international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the United States Environment Agency, ratified his decision to delay the decisions made during the Obama period to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states had challenged the EPA Director of the US Environment Agency to Scott Pruitt’s court, Pruitt revoked his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce the emissions of smoke.
According to Pruit, the change shows that the agency led by it takes better into account the needs of the decision-makers responsible for the environment of the States.
Pruitt did not mention any action against his previous decision in the Federal Court of Petitions.
States should start to comply with the 2015 requirements for the Ozone of the ground as of 1.10.
Pruitt announced in June that he would forward the implementation of decisions by year so that his agency would have more time to explore the plan because the Agency would not "intervene in local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was the general prosecutor of Oklahoma, before President Donald Trump appointed him Director of the EPA.
After coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of the decisions against chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change of the Wednesday week is the latest retreat on the Pruiti plan to alleviate the provisions.
Last month, the Federal Tribunal of Petitions in Washington adopted a decision that the Director of the EPA exceeded its powers in attempting to delay the implementation of the Obama Government’s decision concerning oil and gas companies.
In the opinion of Wednesday, Pruitt argued that his full translation in relation to the Ozone Regulations would only strengthen the cooperation of the EPA with the States in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in accordance with the schedule.
“ During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then expected that the activist groups and others would challenge the right to reach an agreement on schedules,” Pruitt said. He challenged the Environment Agency for more than ten times in his previous action.
“We do not believe in the regulation through the trial and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and its powers to us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to exercise its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers in order to ensure that the provisions are "reasonable and based on the best available information".
The Republicans drive a broader change in the Ozone rules in the Congress.
The aim of the legal initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
This week, the General Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman of the New York State, who led the association of States that brought the EPA into trial, told the group to continue pressure.
"The change of the EPA's mind as a result of our complaints is a significant victory for those 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of the smoke sum in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, there were California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
The ozone of the ground surface occurs when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil processing plants and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
A smoke sofa can cause severe difficulty in breathing for sensitive groups, which is also a part of thousands of premature deaths annually.
Public health promoters and environmental protectors welcomed the surprising change in the direction of Pruiti.
“It’s worrying how much pressure was required to make a guy responsible for our breathing air use a healthy sense,” says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre of Biological Diversity.
“We have to fight against Trump’s administration, as its ideological objective is to act on the conditions of polluters and other groups who have their own interests.”
Supercar manufacturer coming to the street landscape - "in the Ferrar style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while aiming to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrari's style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said plans for the press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News news.
All cases of East Savo Hairy vaccines of the same type of virus
The vascular infection is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo, reports THL.
The laboratory of the Virology of Health and Wellness Institute has ensured Thursday that the fifth ash infection in East Savo is the same virus strain with previous infections.
THL has ensured that the ash infection confirmed on Friday 28 July is the same type of virus as the previous cases in East Savo.
Based on this information, all infections found in East Savo are linked to the first ash vaccine detected in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not come up with any other types of ashtic virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may occur from the fifth infectious diseases until mid-August, and therefore the epidemic is not over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, a doctor responsible for the infectious diseases in the primary health care of Soster.
New hamster infections or their suspicions have not been revealed after the fifth secured case.
However, it is still important that everyone take care of the update of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä recalls.
In Pirkanmaa, three new ash diseases were confirmed - "Infections or epidemics are very unlikely"
Finland prepares for the promise of girdle
The soup of Pontika was not even considered to be legalized.
On the background of the grounds that the process produces beverages alongside the metanolysis that is toxic.
Preparing a sparkle at home is legal next year, but not even consider legislating the cooking of a sparkle.
Skills are made by fertilizers, and the sniff is distilled again.
Distillation is based on the grounds that the process, along with wine, produces metanolysis that is toxic.
There has not been any political will to regulate the cooking of the spots as the right of every man, the government adviser Ismo Importing the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared for the reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of Pontica was not considered to be legalised.
It was not brought to the political table either.
There was no debate on the release of distillation, says Chairman Outi Mäkelä (kok.).
He is in a negotiating group of government parties who took a position on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Promise the distillation at home cannot be granted even from the application.
Commercial production will also be subject to authorisation.
Importing it tells us that home production of alcoholic beverages will be subject to a simple rule: alcohol can be manufactured at home by visits.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine at home, you can legally do screaming.
The government has wanted to simplify the rules.
The new law removes the requirements of flavors and flavors and enables the preparation of shield, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still be done so that the raw materials or the flavor and flavourings produced in the course of their use are clearly noticeable in the drink.
Under the new law, drinks can be prepared for themselves as much as you want, and your own alcohol can be given as a gift.
You can't still put it on sale.
The work of Kilju is no longer a public health problem in Finland, the Tuominen believes.
A much greater change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The Alcohol Law is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
Alcohol leaves to the Parliament as soon as the fallen season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament had already taken a position, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was sent to the hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered breast pains, was sent to the South African hospital due to heart attacks.
Pistorius has already been out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is in prison in the Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital in the afternoon.
The inmate confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for research.
In turn, the informant of the Pistorius family told me that the former athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned the six-fold gold medalist of Paralympicians for six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkampi in February 2013.
Littered phone chats reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
The United States President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have bled to Washington Post.
Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop public talks about not paying the proposed border walls.
The President of the United States called Nieto for the fact that this had smashed the wall project publicly. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential election campaign by pledging to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also released a flattering from Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. During the call, a tight exchange of speech was held.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on the way to Australia would be "naureable", "wrong" and "funny". Trump said that the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would make him look like "idiote" because he had proposed a ban on the residence of refugees to the United States.
Trump stopped by saying to Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant call all day.”
Assassination of Georgia: The activists relaunched racist lynch in the hope of the right to racist lynch
Ford Mercury’s brand car passes the crowd in the small town of Monroe in Georgia and continues its journey towards a small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers in the car and a white driver, four armed men block the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the team, a middle-aged man dressed in a stripe dress, takes a deep breath of his cigar and swirls through the windscreen.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man is shouting.
"Get out of the car!"
The lips break silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a relaunch that was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the whispering is genuine when the hanging eye is put on the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, the Human Rights Organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to resettlement events in 1946. At that time, Ku Klux Klan shortened two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's been charged with murders.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested in these years – even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the redemption arrangements.
“It is a shame in history, but above all it is a burden that presses our soul.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congress representative.
It is a re-launching call for action, and it also reminds Monroe’s people that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want the accused to be brought to trial, and we want to finally end things, and we want to recover from sorrow and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice,” Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make reconciliation before we get justice."
The examiner covers the body of the dead victim in Georgia's massacre on 27 July46.
According to NBC's news FBI documents, more than 50 men were suspected of a lynch of Monroe and its surrounding district.
No one was accused of murder.
Although the accused have been free for decades, activists say the motives of the lynch have been known to the locals all the time: politics and sex.
In 1946, black men of the Georgian state had the highest right to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The Supreme Court adopted its decision in April, and the elections were held in summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident in the time of the election, where Roger Malcom, a black lease farmer, stabbed a white landlord Barnett Hester in a fight with Malcom’s wife Dorothy.
Brooks said that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was waiting for this child.
According to the FBI's data, the influential white owner, Loy Harrison, paid Malcom's $600 warranty for which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and organized murders," said the FBI report.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities; the authorities were involved in murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks expresses it more centrally.
"It was a legal assassination," he said.
"They were murdered because they wanted to be told that they would do the same if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has directed the re-labour of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The show is extremely realistic and imprisoning. It is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe that they have already disappeared from the US today.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to see what Greene says it's supposed to be.
“We don’t want to talk about lynch because we’re going to have to meet our own dark side,” says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year’s performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen black men and twenty whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the presentation.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant manager of Greene.
He has been reinstalling the leader of the local Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and controversial.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
“It is important, however, that this side of history will be kept in mind so that it will never happen again.”
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona are trained by Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, and he's angry about having a relationship with Dorothy.
"Don't you hear me?
Rascona, Hester.
Then we're going to hit.
And then all (all black-skined actresses) squeeze into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
“What?” Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"Et", Greene insects.
"I just don't think white people used the word n--u."
"Yes," the second black actor confirms.
"It's a slang. You need to use a longer version."
The subject of the show is unpleasant, but the room has the power of a guy's spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, and they want to respect the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene begins from the beginning.
Now the words of Rascona stand.
No one's laughing.
Resistance will end quickly and violently.
Scream, shots – and silence.
A woman dressed for a black funeral stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks every second word.
A few ten meters away, fifty viewers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience is black and half white.
There are a couple who have come to see the show from Ithaca in New York, but most of them are local.
They have been guided by Brooks in the graves of the victims in the pressing humidity of Georgia.
Murders have become real from the story.
After the song show, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Kids are crawling to watch the blood and unmoved bodies and whispering each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutches like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the public.
The actresses who played the lynchers take off their robes and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then pours into tears after a tough show.
"It's okay," a woman involved in the presentation will comfort you.
“We know you’re not him.
You did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and actors will meet for a common dinner.
The white couple arrived from Altanta discusses the show with the black-skind couple that he just met.
Denise Duplinskin is difficult to find words when he describes the feelings raised by the presentation.
“It’s hard to listen to terrible words and to watch terrible things that say and do people who look the same as you – just because they look the same as you,” he says.
"I had a show to notice that the lynks are still happening," he added. "They are just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks remembers the development of civil rights to listeners sitting on the same table.
He said he started planning the next year.
“A new resistance is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we’ve experienced, but it’s also a teaching experience,” Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it.”
Growing Rides in Stores Falls: This is how much the removal of "excessive parts" really saves
Is it permitted to remove the floral leaves already in the store before weighing?
What about taking off an anonymous big piece of hat?
The answer is strongly divided by opinions: for one it is a sign of the extreme snack, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that they do not use and, however, go home to garbage.
The event is recognized in stores.
For example, the K-Citymarket section of the Helsinki Ruoholahde has boxes of cardboard boxes, as many of them, for example, rip off the florist’s leaves.
The leaves from the box are sold into biowaste.
According to the news published by the economic statements, the sniffing of vegetables is amazed by traders.
But how much is the removal of additional parts of vegetables before weighing really saving money?
How important is the sniffing method really?
We Women tested how the price changes when taking leaves or strains away from ananas, latva artichoke, delicious, parsley and floral.
Cauliflower: 2.10 euros of flower cauliflower was 1.80 euros when all leaves were shelled.
Ananas: The total cost of an anonymous cost of 2.30 euros fell to 1.95 euros when its position was withdrawn.
Latva-artisokka: the price of €2.60 became €2.40 when the short position broke out.
Two delicious dogs cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Parsacal: Medium broccoli cost 1 euro and without carrying 80 cents.
The end result: If leaves and strains go off, saves a few decades of cents for one vegetables.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20%.
These purchases would have saved a total of €1.20!
Neymar was purchased out of Barcelona - the barbecue star signed a five-year agreement with PSG
The Brazilian Legislator Neymar has signed a five-year deal with the French football club PSG, says AFP.
Previously on Thursday evening, Neymar’s representatives had paid a $222 million out purchase price to FC Barcelona in the Spanish League of Football.
The maximum transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million for the French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League brake the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment company of Neymar representatives.
The company who purchases under the Liiga rules cannot pay out purchases directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract, which happens by recycleing money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to a new home public at the opening of the PSG period against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines the details
Barcelona also reported that it would provide information on the payment of the European Football Union to Uefa in order to determine the possible disciplinary measures arising from the case.
For example, President Javier Tebas of the Spanish League has suspected PSG’s infringing the rules of the Uefa’s economic fair game.
Uefa may be punished by an amount of more than EUR 30 million over three years of loss.
According to Uefa, Neymar’s transfer does not automatically break its economics.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG affects the company’s economy for several years, but the effect cannot be assessed in advance.

Austin, 21, got a lot of burning lightning from the attack - the stamping was stored on the airport's security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing normal work measures for the aircraft at South-Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues, suddenly hit the lightning machine from the rainy sky.
The power of the lightning throws the machine on the wing near the land of Dunn.
Dunn went to the hospital.
He had a third degree of burns all over his body.
My father called me and said the brother had an electric shock and he was in the hospital.
I just asked if he was alive, and Austin's sister, Autumn, said.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the fires, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
I can't wait for that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn tells me.
According to the airport representative, the lightning warning system was at the time of the case and the transport movement itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revives business dividend by cutting
The British Training Group Pearson announced on Friday that he would reduce 3,000 jobs and cut the dividend by 72% in response to the new structural restructuring programme.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company has already reduced 4,000 jobs in the context of previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that the cost will be reduced again by £300 million in May as part of his third savings programme, aimed at restoring the weakened business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its share of Penguin Random House to his partner, Bertelsmann, and the company announced that he would keep his prospect of the current year. Its turnover increased by 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Assassination in Kabul: a NATO soldier died in a suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military embassy in the capital city of Afghanistan in Kabul, according to the officials, he was killed by a NATO soldier and several others were wounded.
According to NATO, five soldiers and interpreters were injured in the attack.
According to unsertifiable local data, three civilians died in the Kabul Qarabagh region.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in the explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died at the attack of a suicide bomber in the Embassy of Iraq in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, Thursday night explosion occurred when NATO and Afghanistan's military patrol were subject to an attack on a "person with a self-determined explosion device".
The opinion stated that everyone injured was stable and treated at the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan, of which 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, in the area of the city where they mainly live in Shiiamuslims.
The Taliban announced that he was behind the attack.
On the last day of May in the centre of Kabul, more than 150 people died in a bombing attack, which was the country’s most destructive militant group attack after the United States’ troops invaded the Taliban power in 2001.
Violence underlines the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the recent suicide attacks in Kabul have also significantly weakened the trust of people in the government, its policy, and in particular President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPA takes its decision to postpone the implementation of the smoke contract provisions
The U.S. Environment Agency, EPA, decided to delay the implementation of the decisions to reduce the emissions of smoke during the Obama administrative period after 15 states had challenged the Court of Justice of the Agency.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called "ozone definitions" in 2015 in late Wednesday, according to the Agency, which shows its commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," said Scott Pruitt in the opinion of the Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Agency to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year to October 2018.
On Tuesday, the Agency challenged 15 states, mainly controlled by the Democrats, including District of Columbia, and the postponement of implementation was illegal.
President Donald Trump has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental rules of Barack Obama. Trump said that the measures are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
Trump’s actions have been opposed by democrats and environmental protectionists who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA website, air breathing containing ozone "may weaken the lung function and increase breathing symptoms", such as as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person in the lead figures of Isis had also sent the building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to suspects, the bomb was intended to be taken to the aircraft on July 15, but the company was suspended before the security check was carried out.
The police don't tell me why the company's interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colourless gas extraction device and to bring the device to a full public place, such as public transportation.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police racials on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews are also continued.
Nesteen CEO: Renewable fuels managed well
The result of the oil-processing Nest before the taxes fell, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Managing Director Matti Lievose, the company made a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products increased to the record level and the development of the marketing & Services segment’ profits were right.
Last year, the comparable business profit improved the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.

The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and our growth projects, and we will complete the strategic investments we have already notified in 2017, Lievonen said in the newsletter.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatšenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatšenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at a collision course for the most interesting boxing match for the nearest future of less than 66.7 kilograms, met each other on Thursday.
Men were in their own rooms in the ESPN Sports Channel offices in Los Angeles until WBC's unbeatable light series master Mikey Garcia walked through the hallway to greet the champion of the upper feather series of the WBO.
Garcia won the showtime on Saturday with the unanimous decision of the former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner. Afterwards Garcia and Lomatšenko have been among the top five lists of boxers of different weight classes.
Garcia handed his right hand and asked, "How's it going, Master?
Good luck with the match!"
Lomatšenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN channel on Saturday.
When the twin pose for photographers, the manager of Lomatšenko, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the match between men would be “perfect in relation to the coke.”
"I'm a former feathersman," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved a series above [63.5 pounds] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kg.
I want to go back to the light series.
He has to get to the light series, and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fill their wishes."
Lotšenko agreed.
“Screaming needs this match.”
Klimas asked if the match should be held on the payment channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatšenko that Lomatšenko debytoed in the light series later this year and won Garcia (37-0-30 wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell are fighting in the light series in the Forum on 23 September.
"The match could be on the payment channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced he was ready to fight on a channel that offers the best prize package.
“We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets that much attention.
It's okay for me as soon as we get to the deal."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomatšenko as "incredible fighter" and maybe he was going to see the Saturday match.
Lomatšenko interrupted Garcia's screaming and said that this three-weight master from Riverside seemed "true slow.
Garcia said he was focusing on the show of the impact force first and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them was wanted to be more and more strong.
“This is the match that is expected.
No other match attracts equal attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lotšenko said she was expecting to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's going to be a great match."
Average salary 5 300 euros, education what happens - the situation of investment advice was "violet and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot recently.
Last time the Helsingin Sanomat told Ritvasta, 68, to whom the banker’s investment counselling spoke full bunny when selling investment products.
The rules on the sale of investment advisers and various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of the next year.
The tightenings are based on a new Financial Markets Directive, which will be applied from the beginning of the next year.
Currently, the assessment of the skills of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no knowledge requirements specified in the Act.
The financial sector (FA) recommends that those working in the investment service carry out its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorityd the organisation of the degrees to APV investment studies for a company called Oy, whose degree work group sits both in the Financial Supervision (Fiva), universities and industry experts.
The degrees are 12-15 degree points, and their exams are produced by Aalto EE, the Aalto University Executive Education Ltd.
Its website says that, in general, both exams are "very large in relation to requirements".
The study material includes 10-15 books as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of the APV Investment Studies, says that the percentage of exams is roughly estimated at about 70.
Most of the staff of the largest banks, mostly, all the investment services providers have completed either APV1 or APV2 degrees, because their performance is mandatory according to their own rules.
Then there are smaller bankruptcies without mentioning the names of whose staff seem to have maped the completion of the qualifications, says Savikko.
He said that such bankruptcy was "changing".
According to Saviko, the APV1 degree has been completed since 2000 by 13,000 to 14,000 people and more demanding APV2 degrees for investment advisers from around 3,000 people.
Some bank transactions consider the qualification to be an advantage.
In most other sectors, there are significantly more stringent skills requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Sector Recommendation requires APV degrees to be completed, because that is when it is the case that investment expertise is guaranteed.
According to the Statistical Centre, financial and investment advisers will earn on average a number of thousands of euros per month, including commissions, natural and income fees.
The average monthly period of work is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men who work in the task will earn over €5 900 per month, and women will earn more than €4 500 per month.
On average, the tenth of most earners earn about 8 100 euros.
The tenth decade of the most earning men earns more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, a tenth of the most earning women earns EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Service Act can only be provided by an authorised company.
The level of worker and task has so far been relied on self-regulation.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by it received individual cases where the skills and qualifications of the investment adviser were not sufficient on the basis of the activities of the adviser.
In principle, as a retailer of investment products, even if professional skills and qualifications are at a heated level.
In this respect, the situation has been wild and free.
In most other sectors, there are significantly more stringent skills requirements, says Savikko.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will result in tightening with the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires each company to be responsible for the adequate competence of the staff providing investment services.
Financial supervision may, in turn, be empowered to determine what to know.
Marko Hovi, Fiva Market Manager, says that one of the clear changes to the present is the legislation on the knowledge and experience of investment advisers and investment products sellers.
According to the Court, the new requirements concern both the personal staff of investment firms and related agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to the Government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will be empowered to impose knowledge and experience.
What they are exactly, they will be decided in this view during the coming autumn.
The company must also continue to ensure the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty to show that this is also done.
The Court explains that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the work of the staff at individual level.
This will certainly be subject to different requirements depending on whether it is about investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the court, it is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced in the time period if the knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person meeting the criteria for a certain period.
According to the court, the changes make the rules tighten and specific.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

Imatra’s giant beach schoolers do not delay rain or the sun’s roast - Iines Kaikkonen polski with the help of a swimstone
Iines Kaikkonen progressed at a good speed, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach resorts are running in Liette and Lempuka this and next week.
Even though it rains and then shines again, young swimmers aren’t too bad, Taina Itkonen, the guide of swimming schools, praises.
In swimming schools this week, 13 children, next week, have a decade of swimming skills.
The number of children in the next week was influenced by the fact that the school and the hero will begin, assessing itkonen.
The Imatra Coast School is organised in collaboration by the Sports uniting the project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, Liette's swimming pool was a nice atmosphere.
The sun shined and young swim schoolers trained to stay on the surface with swimming baths, someone already without.
Smaller sisters also enjoyed in the water.
Iines of Kaik, 5, first assumed to go deeper into water.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged him to pollute towards the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen told me he went swimming a lot this summer.
Liette's swimming beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaiken, the swimming pool was swiming hardly with Vili Apriltanen, 5.
You can also be pleased with the achievements of today, the swimming course praised.
Jami Kallio, 4 again wanted to go to the water wars.
Her daughter Anna Villberg, 6 swimmings from the beach, Ilona Villberg, is a good start to study the beach swimming school.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna liked to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming schools were packed on the dock.
The boys had enough trouble with a frog found on the beach.
Millions of Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread to the fertilizer towels, snapped fruits and shined the day.
In the water, teaching continued, but the ferry didn’t hurry.
It's like not belonging to summer.
An unfamiliar soldier sells toilet brushes - "This is such a combining story."
You see all that.
The Sini product, which manufactured cleaning products, lanseered a few days ago the unknown military product series.
So, dish brushes and washing brushes, and "wc brush on the edge brush".
In this autumn, the unknown soldier refers to the film and the marketing of the film.
However, there is something special in the combination, and the products are irrigated in social media: When will unknown health ties come?
I need to call the company and ask what this is about.
What does Aino Määät say?
We're a partner in the movie.
We are supporting this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määttä says.
He said the products will be specialized in the movements, and the film will thus get visibility.
Isn't this a little funny - often when you think that products and related stories have something in common?
Yes, this is a similar combining story that we are a Finnish player and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic values of Finland that are supported by those who have seen the old unknown soldier.
And cleaning is not a foreigner to military culture, Määtä says.
Other business partners in the military film include, for example, Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall vichys have been placed on the market, which are known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unfamiliar products have already been posted by a blogger in the Finnish Film Magazine Kalle Kinnunen
There are already coffee and watches available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film's first night, so there's still a future.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, such as the Valio, the Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen.
New results of age tests for Swedish asylum seekers were published
The latest results of the medical age tests for applicants of Sweden have been published. The results of the tests carried out by the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of the tests were determined to be more than 18 years old. However, not everyone considers the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Judicial Medicines Agency started testing earlier this year.
Tests can be evaluated in more detail the age of the applicant for asylum. A new test was introduced after the assessment of the Swedish Immigration Agency that it had failed to determine the real age of applicants who claimed themselves to be a minor.
The Immigration Agency has conducted 6 880 tests so far, and the Medical Agency has now published the results of 2 481 tests. The tests were carried out between March and July in 2017.
The 80% of those tested, i.e. the 2002 asylum seeker, was determined to be more than 18 years old, and in addition, the Agency of Law Medicine determined in 25 cases that the test was "possibly 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, the final result was that the asylum seeker was “may be less than 18 years old”.
The tests were only carried out in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson’s Legal Medicine Agency tells us that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are quite uniform. There are no significant differences in the statistics of the previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were determined to be over 18 years old, it does not necessarily mean applicants lied to their age.
In May, the Agency announced the results of 581 tests and announced that in 442 there were "referencing that the investigation was 18 years old or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet studied the same results, it was found that in 243 cases the applicant had openly told him that he would meet for 18 years this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes röntgen images of wisdom teeth and magnetic genres. Then dentists and radiologists analyze photos. The method is also criticized.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist of the Karolinian Institute, Claude Marcus, whose job is to assess the biological maturity of humans.
“I have had a reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
Determination of a biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are certainly unable to determine the age, we should not pretend that we can do it," he said to the Metro newspaper.
Göransson, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: “It is generally possible to say that the risk of determining the child as an adult is small.
The risk is the highest in a situation where the test will soon be 18 years, and then the risk will be about 10%."
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five more than a pair of results in the third round, Mikko Ilosen spent 30 articles on the score slider downwards in the European Golf Tour in Scotland.
At the end of the round, Ilonen left on Saturday, at the 11th, but found a 41th position in the end of the round.
Ilosse was gathered with three bogs with a double bog.
Other people had a hard time.
The English Ian Poulter rose up to share the top position in one less than a pair round, even though she told me that there was enough work in the umbrella length.
Keli was raw, but I hanged up and finally the day was good, Poulter's tum.
He will share the top with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and an Australian Andrew Dodt.
Western Virginia Governor Exchanges Party
The Western Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday night in Trump's campaign event to change the party.
“The Democrats simply rejected me,” Justice said.
“Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection... today I will tell the West Virginia that I can no longer help you as the governor of the Democrats.”
The public broke up with a grieving popularity.
“To be a member of the Republican Party registered tomorrow,” Justice added.
As a coach, I would tell you that it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised that a significant announcement would be made at the Western Virginia campaign event.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherits his father's mining company and owns carbon mines in five states.
The value of his property is about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday night, the National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) published an opinion that "Current Justice's party exchange is a new attack on a democratic party which would rather build obstacles than better America."
“The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, the Declaration of Justice is the latest retreat for the party with no leadership and cannot find a positive message that connects people,” Ronna McDaniel said in his opinion on CBS’s news.
Lightning sown damage - Thursday coming up even in the summer very thundering day
In the end of the week, we also get more thunders in South Finland.
During the last week, it has been devastated, especially in the middle and north parts of the country, as well as in the Warsaw Finland region.
In the midweek to Thursday, lightning shots triggered several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be a very thundering day of this summer.
The deaf have finally found Finland as well.
During the past week, he has flashed especially in the middle and north parts of the country and in the area of Varsinais-Suomi.
At the table, the lightning hit the electric center of the line house, causing a small fire.
The rescue agency received an announcement of the fire about 15 minutes without midnight on Wednesday.
The electric center was located in the sauna mode at the end of the line house.
The rescue facility sealed the roof and the wall to find the firewalls and quickly turned the fire off.
A total of 11 apartments were left without electricity, but persons were avoided.
On vacation, the lightning lighted the outdoor building into flames on Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue facility arrived there, the building was already at a full stage of fire, and the rescue department could nothing but prevent the spread of the fire.
The exterior building of about fifty square meters burned the ground.
On Kuopio's way to the Dwarf Village, the lightning hit the homehouse.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a stamping flash.
The Rescue Department was there to check the case, but this time the lightning didn’t get the fire - only a few melts of the fire.
In traffic, thickness caused problems on the train track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The error was received between 8 and 9 Thursday morning, after which the interim trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was only resolved before five afternoons.
Since then, train traffic has been able to continue normally also with the potent track section of the thickness.
The lightnings have sown the destruction across Finland.
However, lightning has been small this summer.
This summer's thunderstorms have been very endeavours! evaluated by the meteorologist Jari Tuovinen of the Air Science Institute.
The midweek and Thursday thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in their strength, but thanks to the low-light lightning of the summer, it also feels like many even strong.
This might seem to be a very tough old man, but that's what it has been compared to this summer's old mans, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the landscapes blew 1700 times, and on Thursdays there has been potential for even the hardest summer thundering day: around 16:00 a.m. there were 1,790 landscapes in the plaque.
If the lightning continues to the early side of the evening, you can reach more than two thousand lightnings, the Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record weakness of the wolf year was experienced in 2015, when the lightning volume of the year was about 30,000 copies.
By Wednesday, this year’s lightning was increased to 18,386 lightning.
It is still important that this year does not violate the two years guaranteed "review".
However, the squirrel can expect to continue.
According to the Tuovis, the air mass above Finland will also remain warm and wet during the end of the week, which is a promising birth environment for thunders.
The main weight of the storms is to go from the norther parts of the country to the south, where you can get about 2,000 lightning days on Saturday and Sunday.
There is a more uniform rainbow in the middle of the country.
In such cases, Tuovise said that it only scarcely thunders.
Coe praises Russia's "faithful" apology for the doping scandal
The world’s general sports officer Sebastian Coe praised the apology that Russia submitted on Thursday due to the doping scandal, but Coe added that it was not yet time to stop the Russian ban.
Dmitri Shljahtin, Russian general athlete director, said at the IAAF Congress of the MM competition on Thursday, that the ban received by Russia is appropriate and that he intends to fight decisively against doping.
He said he was sorry for “all the athletes that were taken from the races of gold or silver.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the extension of the ban. Russia was excluded from general sport competitions in November 2015 after the World Antidoping Office WADA report provided evidence of the state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very straightforward. It was a fairly open presentation," the President of the IAAF Coe told the journalists.
“The whole Council and Congress were pleased with the fact that the Russian Association of Sports admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that they would do everything they could to reorganise their activities.”
Coe also said he was “satisfactory” to accept the conditions for terminating the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but the Congress supports the group's recommendation that it is not the right time to stop the Russian ban," Coe said.
“In the coming months, we need to do everything we can to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with the status of a neutral athlete in London at the MM competitions on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of IAAF.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Working Group, said Monday that Russia must still meet many requirements before its position can be restored.
“The test is still inadequate, and the trainers who have been banned are still free to operate,” he told the journalists on Friday after the presentation of the IAAF Council in London.
The production company disappointed the weak success of the Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland film did not become such a success as the authors wished, says Yle.
If honestly said, I am disappointed, admits that the film was produced by Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorff Yle in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film received its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair 100 000 viewers, which is a little compared to the film budget, about 5 million euros.
There was no lottery win here, but now it is important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been better in the country, they would have already received their money.
Now, we need to wait for a small breakdown of foreign spreads, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How Football Financial Rules affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European football euros do not prevent Neymar from moving from Spain from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in France. This is the most expensive player transfer of football all time.
Its possible sanctions for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by the UEFA regulating European football, which can prevent the participation of teams in the respected Master League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair game economic rules, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar’s transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million to terminate a Brazilian contract, and Neymar’s annual salary in the new company is moving in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty paying the amount of Neymar transfer and attaching it to its Star Guard, as it follows funding the enriched regimen of Qatar oil.
The clubs can use large amounts to buy players, but they need to be balanced with real sources of income so that football-related business is not lossful.
The economic rules of the fair game were drawn up as President of the UEFA in 2007 on the initiative of the French Michel Platin.
As a former footballer, Platini believed that the pursuit of success with debt was a scam and led to serious problems if banks or owners drew their support.
In 2011, the economic rules of the fair game shifted from debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used in Chelsea for the first time in 2003 was significantly difficult. Abramovitš purchased a promising team, used huge sums for gambling projects and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of fair game economic rules lasts until 2018, during which the tracks may make up to EUR 30 million losses.
Although Platin had to leave the UEFA president’s duties scandalously in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin also wants to control the use of the clubs.
"The rules of fair game are still in place, and we will apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso in UEFA, responsible for fair game economic rules, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a single compensation, it can distribute the amount in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement, so the transfer amount can be recorded at EUR 44.4 million per year for the next five years.
On the basis of fair game’s economic rules, the first sanctions were granted in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and on Manchester City financed from Abu Dhab.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the company was also ordered to limit its Master League group to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of 25 players.
UEFA monitors the series that may try to circumvent its economic rules by increasing its income through companies associated with the owners of the club.
For example, if a qatari company supports PSG, but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA does not calculate the aid as a real result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014, that the Qatar Tourism Authority’s support to PSG had been supervised.
It has also been revealed that some of Neymar's earnings in PSG could be financed by the fees available from the Qatar 2022 MM competition organisation committee.
However, the PSG and the Arrangement Committee have denied that Neymar would be prevented from making a MM competition ambassador. The UEFA would be very easy to reveal such a arrangement.
Due to the previous sanctions of PSG, UEFA will follow more than usual companies by twisting the rules.
On Thursday, the sources from the situation reported that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG on Neymar's transfer.
The sources provided an interview to the Associated Press news agency, under the condition that their identity is not revealed because they have no authority to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the latest published accounts, the net sales of the PSG between 2015 and 2016 were EUR 542,4 million and the profit of more than EUR 10 million.
The last year's accounts have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase the sale of track products and game shirts.
The follow-up estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish League was clearly annoyed from the best players in the world, trying to make Neymar’s transfer difficult, allegedly breaking the fair game’s economic rules.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the company and the state," said the Spanish League President Javier Tebas to the Spanish AS newspaper, referring to the qatari ownership of PSG.
Arsenal’s manager, Arsenen Wenger, also, has reservations about the state’s funding of the football club. Arsenal’s owns an American sports club.
"The killing is the result of ownership that has changed the football environment in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the rules of the fair game. There are so many interests related to the fact that a famous player represents the state."
Now I am in a hurry: Finnish MM athletes coach in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahden and threesome Christianina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should train general sports at the MM competitions in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without his coach’s advice.
The Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the long-standing and on Saturday in the triangle.
However, two coachs, the Armenian Ghazaryan, have not received a visa to the United Kingdom.
Ghazary has been trying to deal with this in the British Embassy with no results.
The coach has a call for MM competition organizers as a document, but it is also not suitable for a visa.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, the coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always handled visas successfully before himself, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazary has worked for the Finnish Sports Union for SUL for years.
It doesn't matter so much.
As long as someone looks at the staircase, Arttu Pajulahti told his coach about the possible extinction.
MM Metal for FinlandLonto requires a miracle
The MM competitions in general sports will begin in London today on Friday and will last at the end of the fair week on Sunday 13 August.
General sports, terrain skiing and ice hockey are the species for which Finnish penis athletes can feel passionate from year to year, whether or not success.
The success in the hearts of pencil athletes is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other meters.
Less attention will be given to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from the value races to another where the experience of gaining an athlete’s performance is immature to the level that the MM medal of adults is truly possible.
Now, there are no young athletes in the small MM team in Finland, and not even congaries.
A MM medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport is that miracles can happen.
It draws the bench athletes to the television screen and glue to follow the races, even though the London medals are solved due to the difference of time only in the afternoon.
For the previous MM competitions in 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by Tero Longmäki.
The dares are still waiting for a long-standing medal, even though the others tell the results of his and other heirs in recent times and the stay of the long-standing in the last summer’s value races.
Whatever happens in these races, Longmäki will remain in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
Access to the final competition for other Finnish athletes or making their own record is sufficiently good.
Hope and believe in the realistic medal hunt of Finland’s general sport for the coming years will give good success in the international values of young people this summer.
The processing of young talents and the financial support of its work is more important than maintaining a small elite set of representative athletes.
Success does not come in a moment, but requires years of sweating work from athletes and patience from both trained and bench athletes.
Finnishs also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, London’s races will remain in history as the races of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, and not because of terrorism’s scary or poor attacks.

Viking Linen's new fast-track ship roamed to the port in Helsinki
Viking's new fast-trailer FSTR is badly late for the schedule.
The fast ship was to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 18:00.
In eight countries, the ship was loading.
The ship came to Helsinki late.
At least a half-hour I've been waiting for you to get to the ship.
Now the car line moves a little, in the Helsinki harbour, the Estonian Johannes Rebane, who waits for access to the ship, told me at 19.30.
Rebane thought there was a technical error on the new ship.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles waiting for the ship.
Viking's communication chief Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical mistake.
It was repaired at the Helsinki harbour.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says the ship will also be late for a couple of hours from the return trip to Tallinn.
The ship was to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 20.15.
42 metres of special transport disrupts traffic on Thursday nights
42 metres of special transportation moves from Municipal to Mustola port during Thursday night.
The shipping from 9 should be here by evening.
Police are running traffic in six, and traffic may be stopped at a time.
The shipping from the hill moves along the 13th road to the Mustola harbor.
Small District Nostalgism: Wet Hot American Summer and Comprade Detective
At the same time, the story hails both the monument days of the 80s and the 90s grunge (this time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great The State scandal for MTV) and their own time – the year 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars moved to larger things in their career.
As a cultural product, it is both a parodia and a description of the constant memory we have stuck in during the Facebook period.
As a commercial product, it feels like it has already been alive.
The first day of Camp was surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (e.g. the background story of the vegetarian in the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
At the heart of Vits, middle-aged actors act as an adorable teenager who approaches full-age age. It is highlighted by the inability of reaching the past is part of a joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional-based, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, it parodizes the 90-century stalker films, such as the horror movie Hand who swings the glove.
In one section, one of the characters digs out Apple Powerbook, inline rollers, and "other stuff from 1991".
Many stories are the same as before.
Well-being Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer, but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in a mad run-in, Ronald Reagan (the age of Michael Showalter) is involved in George H. W. Bush (which plays Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best is the sideways.
It’s especially fun to see an immense Paul Rudd, with underneath the beard, namely Matt Dillon’s "soul patch" film Singles. Ruddin’s acting Andy, the king of the camp, begins to be an old man.
The moments of accidental madness may bring this series into the flight as a kind of recurring Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, the team of friends will go to the Wet Hot American Summer film first night.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series again attracts another nostalgia: The Americans series of cold war, the Atomic Blonde, and even the GLOW series, where the West is facing.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It has been made a Romanian police drama in the 1980s where the Bucharest cop pair fights for truth, atheism and marksism lenism.
In the main part of the hardcore Gregorina and the idealistic Iosefina, Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici are seen. Their turns have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But that's not much more than that.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (polices spend time watching chess on TV the same way as Americans watching football).
There are a number of famous sound actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny. They get a fun game for their bonging.
However, the comrade detective is too caught in the imitation of the socialist drama of the clumsy – for example, the killer behind the Reagan mask is involved. Therefore, the series often starts to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the serial humor is not fast enough and not bold.
The series could work better as agitprop satellite, even when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and have always two fat men in the hall.
The message to the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginative Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: our greed is a turtle of our own history and their history.
Kouvolan Toni Tauru rises to Macao on Saturday - against the former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match up.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone against Macao, because the Brazilian Leandro Issa fought in the UFC last year.
Brazilians also have the black belt of Jujutsu and the world championship of the species.
For once, I'll take myself against my parents.
It's a funny thing, 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
The cowboy had to get into the circle in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was withdrawn due to logistical problems, but three struggles were received on a fast schedule for the Chinese self-government area in Macao.
Tauru has never faced such a thing before.
This was the first time my match was canceled.
It was annoying, because preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the fighter is pleased to have a new time for the struggle.
Weekly waiting does not affect preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, because it does not improve in a week.
The condition can go even worse if you're practicing too much.
Tauru has encountered opponents whose strengths are in the formation.
This time, the situation is different.
Issaa couvolan describes it as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I'm guessing he's coming on the first round hard and trying to get him to the mattress.
He has won the jujutsu World Championship, so he can wrestle.
The previous match of the Kouvola didn't go according to the plans.
The Philippinesan Kevin Belingon hit Tauru badly in the eye, and the victory remained on the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially: he didn't get any hits.
When I left to pour, he hit my eye.
It was really bad for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the freelance players are fighting once a year, some are growing in the circle more densely.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought the last time in September.
Tauru had three matches last year.
The second struggle of the year is now ahead.
Sometimes the time has become pregnant.
I've been practicing and having been in good condition for the past few years.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the future encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training in Espoo, and I got the pleasure back.
We got really good exercises when there was a friend from Sweden.
Exercise was a great help, because on Saturday, the couvolian must be prepared for physical struggle.
I have been able to train against the same-sized opponents and practice a vertical match.
It's a 32-year-old's main tactic.
We have to beat it rationally.
If there's a chance, I'll go take it myself.
Sub-exports must not be given for free because they consume the most.
Macao has previously been attracted to Tauru in China.
He says it's China Las Vegas.
I think there's a big and great night ahead.
The Central Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Central Bank of England is expected to report that it keeps interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been inefficient and that inflation steadily has stopped speculations from interest.
The Central Bank of England has warned that economic growth continues slowly. The Bank shifted interest rates because of increasing pressure on the income level of families.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s monetary policy committee decided to hold interest rates by 6 to 2%. This month the interest rate was less favourable as economic growth has been inefficient.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank decreased its growth forecast to 1.7% in 2017 and forecasted to 1.6% in 2018, and also warned that the household income level would be more pressured, as inflation is expected to continue to increase by nearly 3% in autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rates are needed in the coming years to reduce the inflation accelerated by Brexit, and the Bank also announced that the loan costs may need to be increased more than expected in the financial market.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package, which was launched a year ago in the post-maining of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to offer cheap funding for banks more than £15 million, i.e. 115 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision states: "The estimate of the Committee responsible for Finance is that the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years when the reduction in household real income reduces consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated that the market's expectations of some degree of tightening of monetary policy are needed to mitigate inflation.
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that possible increases were "sized" and "limited".
In May, the bank predicted the growth of 1.9% for this year and the growth of 1.7% for the next year.
It now held its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound was weakened compared to the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
In contrast to the dollar, the pound decreased by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31 per cent, which decreased by 0.4 per cent compared to the euro and was 1.11 euros.
The decision to keep the interest rates unchanged after the expected weaker growth rates decreased by increased expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but will slightly increase at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from accelerated inflation and low wage increases, according to the Bank, the situation will deteriorate even before it becomes better.
The Bank added that monetary policy cannot prevent the drop in income in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to “significantly” at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also strengthen the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak £1, which will revoke part of the reduction in private consumption.
The decision was taken a year after the interest rate was reduced to 0.25% after a shocked result of the EU referendum, which put the GBP down.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will be likely to be seen in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Before the latest decision of the central bank, the increases in the interest of the central bank had been reduced to demand more and more loudly, when inflation increased the pressure on households. Three decision-makers requested a 0.5% increase in the rate in July.
In the past month, inflation decreased to 2.6% of 2.9% in June, but according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation is rising again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the two-percent exceedment of the target was due to a weak pound.
"In view of the recent decrease in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market would seem to increase even more when lenders hotly search for customers and want to end the year strongly," said Coreco Mortgage Brokers Director Andrew Montlake.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is ending. The latest agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also unnecessary options."
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV medicines
Since September, patients can be prescribed a “reverse” HIV anti-violence medicine. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute concerning the financing of the drug in the English public health system (NHS).
NHS announced that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. It has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in individuals prior to the combination.
The NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the Court of Justice held the last year’s judgment of the Supreme Court, according to which NHS is able to pay the PrEP drug, even though it claims that the local authorities should finance it.
Mr Simon Stevens, head of the NHS of England, called the decision on Thursday as a "significant new intervention", and the National AIDS Organization described it as "repressive for a moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield begin to receive registrations for experiments that will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure inhibition therapy (PrEP) should be taken prior to combination with a HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
Before administering the drug, it means that the body has sufficient medications to prevent HIV infection during the intercourse.
The medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transsexuals, as well as people with a HIV-positive partner who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics select the conditions for testing meet applicants for men, women and transgenders and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People who live in England and who are registered in general medical care can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million, and this week the NHS signed a contract on medicinal products after an international invitation to tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and the implementation of treatment.
"This significant new intervention should be complemented and enhanced by the already existing diverse and increasingly effective means to prevent HIV," Stevens said.
“This is another significant achievement in the struggle of more than 30 years in solving the biggest health challenge of humanity.”
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” says Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Organization.
“If PrEP is properly targeted to those who need it and belong to risk groups, it may have a reverse effect on their HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, the risk group will receive through the NHS-funded experiment, a drug that they can choose independently without the need to negotiate with the partner. It has an influential effect that will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
This was a welcome news.”
“The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and no one belongs to the risk group remains outside it,” says Terrence Higgins Foundation’s director Ian Green.
“The PrEP is acquired in the experiment, and we will soon be able to protect 100,000 people from HIV infection.”
"The beginning of the PreEP experiment is a welcome event that has been delayed for many months due to government slowing down," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
“We have evidence that the drug may have a reverse effect on our work we are doing to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this dangerous disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of the PrEP medicine.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible in the whole country, so that we can protect the exposed to HIV and get a step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been able to stop.”
Quality of living: intermediate floor and smart interior solutions have made a small home spacious of Earl's Court's apartment
The enthusiastic banker Joanne Leigh moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the queen Anna’s style house. The success of the remont tells us that Joanne has not yet packed and moved.
"This is what I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to the apartment show and found that the rooms were as high as in my flat.
I loved it right away and made the offer on the same day."
After that, about 90 square apartments have experienced a complete change in shape.
It was a twin where the bedroom was only reached from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and the intermediate floor so that the room height could be used.
“I wanted space, large windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired a job at the Duck & Shed Design Office at Erfan Azad Notting Hill. Erfan was assigned to utilize the state of the rooms of nearly four meters and to create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sales destination but a home.
The room height was not enough for two double spaces, so the challenge was to build a intermediate layer where it was able to stand.
The solution demanded a creative thinking from Erfan.
"The structures are quite complex.
The spaces had to be doubled so that they didn’t need a cyber.
The structures had to be customized so that the height is just suitable for both on and below."
Erfan was able to place two fully-high rooms in the room with the fascinating details.
On the intermediate floor, the retrouvius copper crossing window opens up to a stylish place of residence.
Reflected furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouillen vintage lights create a unique style.
The use of mirrors brings the theatricality, state feel and light.
The mirrors on both sides of the short corridor will make the corridor more effective.
The mirror in the kitchen intermediate space is like a window that opens a view to another room.
Indoor mirror furniture have a storage space for the meals and glass goods of Joanne.
More stylish is that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens equipped with the tail door are not a new solution,
But in the kitchen of Joanne, it is unique that the door is lifted up the same way as the door of the garage.
"It required a little design," Erfan tells me about a steel-resistant slice-pined MDF door.
“It is balanced, i.e. it slips very easily in place.”
With reasonable use and storage space design, Joanne received 16 extra squares, another bedroom and a better base solution.
“When you sell the apartment, the area solves – or the value of the property,” Erfan says.
"In the event of retirement, the property broker walks in the apartment and lowers the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxuriousness to the room.
“It is in touch with the materials of the apartment, and the emotion of the apartment is partly generated on the basis of them,” Erfan says.
"No one's going on the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way.”
Joanne’s apartment is an example of good design and additions to make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you don’t want to move away from the apartment anymore.

He grows us with a sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, the Lahti market appeared at a home where Thai food was sold.
The Lahtians did not dare taste, they walked by.
At home, Panya Suamsri-Penttilä sold food, among the familiars of Panja.
He didn’t know much about Finnish and the Finnishs did not yet know thai at that time.
Because people did not dare to eat, Panja offered free tastes.
This is how he taught the Gulfs to eat Thai food at a time of spring.
Taste tastes, he said.
I fell out of the valley.
I went more and more often, in the end every day.
During the summer 1997, Panja opened its Thai food in the shopping hall of Lahti.
There were two small tables, and I think there were less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the ventory.
When you have hunger and places limited, you can’t leave an empty chair between yourself and the guest.
We got to know better, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat at the table with the dictionary to learn from the Thai.
Two years went to the shopping hall, but then the restaurant had to change, because the spice bars made themselves were supposed to smell too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the shopping hall.
There's room.
Now we judalists can sit in our own tables again, only in the most congested times, we must be shy to ask guests if there is room next door.
Panja knows his client.
They tell him where to go and who to see.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how customer life stages vary and food clubs change.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring roll.
He remembers me slim and fat, and remembers how I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than others, sit next to the kitchen door, and change your belongings with Panja based on the bar.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with a sweet chili sauce.
He has opened our tastes in addition to our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many talk to him about thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panya.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's busy.
He goes to the restaurant and go to the fungus and the blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated two decades of fulfillment.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this great day took place at work.
The discovery of the underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to attack Europe
From the start of the year, security authorities received a list of important jobs against terrorism.
The list contains more than 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt magazine, there are 173 persons in total, and the document also contains photos of each person in addition to their personal data.
More than 130 of the people listed in the list are Iraqi, but there are six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistani and Saudi Arabia.
Evening words told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now, the location of the list and the information it contains has been detailed.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi Army Special Forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and photographs in studying the underground base of the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The background was afraid that something big and serious would have been planned in the West by terrorists to defeat Isis in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list also contains the names and images of all persons, including their date of birth, the invented subsidiaries and information about the country of residence of the person.
The list also includes specific terrorist specialities.
For example, at Sami J, a German 27-year-old, Abu Assid al-Almani, the German.
He was reported to have left Germany in 2012 first travelling to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey to join the Isis lines.
His image was written as a specialized suicide bomber.
There is no more information about the fate of a man.
In total, about 6,000 fighters have left Europe in the Isis rows, whose fate is not sure.
The man spilled under the surface of Helsinki Tokoinranta
Based on the interviews of the rescue facility, the man had wanted to show him that he was able to swim.
Even the storm can save the drowned life.
In the Helsinki Tokoinra, a person underwater was rescued on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, the firemaster of the Helsinki Rescue Service, the situation was rapidly over.
The person was found underwater for about 15 minutes after notification.
The submarine of the rescue facility found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue agency received an announcement after half four afternoon.
The person was delivered in the hands of first care.
Estlander said he was about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show me that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinra is over.
Estlander thanks for the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard and the Police.
It was a task led by the Border Guard.
The locals also guided the divingers excellently.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars crashed in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
There were nine people in the cars, of whom the rest were injured, says the fireman of the day.
There are both men and women injured.
The accident occurred in the crossing of three roads at four times a day.
The accident occurred when the second car turned the warning triangle behind the second car, the fireman said.
According to the rescue facility, the crossing area has a limit of 80 km per hour.
Brothers fight over $500 million for real estate
Two brothers contradict Victoria’s largest property empire, worth over $500 million. The dispute is related to their Italian family’s 40 years ago founded family business.
The former president of Carlton's football club and the real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives only three houses away from his younger brother Paul.
Paul has wanted to leave a family company since 2014, but the difference is a bit bitter dispute.
Brothers and their mother Anna, together, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. Family began to accumulate property when they purchased the Collingwood Smith Street street in 1973.
The family founded a Westco Jeans store that expanded into 160 movements chains.
The sales chain was sold at $85 million in 1999.
The funds were used for real estates, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in Gold Coasti and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to the agreement with the father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul owns about a third of the company's wealth. Paul describes his father as a "perhe bearing power and a central character".
According to the legal documents, the distribution of property means that Colin owns property worth about $316 million and Paul is worth about $ 176 million.
Paul is not pleased with the distribution of real estates and funds.
"I think Colin left the best property for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first oath to the court in 2015.
The case was dealt with last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several mediation companies.
The brothers are now also controversial about who manages the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has closed him off from business.
Colin said it's not true, but he's accusing Paul of the bad treatment of some real estates.
Colin writes in one of his first convincing certificates that he would like to find a solution.
According to our Italian traditions, the family is most important to me,” Colin says in his opinion.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. Voluntary statements, e-mails and reports are hundreds of pages. The case is being examined by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and his late husband Luigi were Italian migrants who founded milk bars and delicious stores at the end of the 1950s. In the early 1970s, they purchased trades from Brunswick.
They were used as a guarantee for buying a family from Collingwood property in which Colin founded the first jean store of the family.
Colin says he founded a trade in the last few years when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the property to their sons.
“Luigi often said that he did not want the brothers to end up in court,” Anna wrote in his statement.
Two other sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group’s business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are “categorized from the financial conditions of their departure”.
Colin has kept a low profile, even though he is the former member of the Australian League of Football and the best friend of the television star Eddie McGuire, according to the lifetime of this year 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered. He said in his text message that it cannot be correctly commented on because it is being dealt with in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to challenge me to court and draw us to the name of our family to fight justice,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept the requirements of his brother.
“Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way,” Colin continued and told him that he would still hope that the matter would be resolved.
Friday's hope seems to have gone out.
“Our case will be resolved in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump's new staff manager intends to limit the use of the president's media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to the Poltico magazine, the new Head of Staff of the White House intends to limit the use of President Trump’s media and monitoring of news so that the boss is not so often in trouble.
Supplier Josh Dawsey reports:
"When the new Head of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with the staff on his first day of work, he took up the main problem he intends to solve: he will limit the access of President Donald Trump's information.
Kelly told the workers of the White House that all the information – both pressed and informed – must be transported through him because the President makes better decisions when he receives good information.”
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit the media use of Trump and failed.
President Trump has a relationship with TV for decades – and as President he still watches a lot of television.
“If Presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news, he was encouraged to show that the media of sympathetic media treated things more equally,” Sam Nunberg, who worked as a adviser in Trump’s campaign, told the Politico magazine in February.
Politicon journalist Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the six former campaign workers said that Trump’s use of Twitter is essential that his personal media flow includes a uniform flow of bells.”
Okay.
But it is ridiculous to say that the use of Trump's Twitter would never have been under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something we don’t know – perhaps Trump’s twitches would have been even more brutal without their efforts.
We will probably never find out what kind of messages Trump has not sent.
If his staff have even been able to prevent problems caused by him a few times, their work has not been unnecessary.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing rash.
The problem is partly because there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their business by providing Trump with information that supports their vision. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers intentionally give the president questionable information.
Supplier Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"Trump's current and former employees say that he can be angry with the magazines in which he is criticized – especially if they tell about harmful data leaks. Then he must know where the information comes from.
This happened at the end of February, when someone gave the president a copy of the news of the GotNews.com website founded by President Charles C. Johnson, which accused Katie Walsh of several White House data leaks.
Johnson was permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment and had previously spread false accusations and later revoked them, and he also did not provide concrete evidence.
However, Trump had started reading the case after asking about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that the staff manager Reince Priebus and the staff secretary of the White House Rob Porter were trying to introduce the management system of documents going to Trump.
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying the same thing three months later.
Maybe he proves to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants continue to drive their own things.
These unchanged facts make Kelly’s task very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year agreement with PSG
The Brazilian Legislator Neymar has signed a five-year deal with the French football club PSG, says AFP.
Previously on Thursday evening, Neymar’s representatives had paid a $222 million out purchase price to FC Barcelona in the Spanish League of Football.
The Neymar agreement with Barcelona was therefore dissolved, and he was free to move to the Paris Society of PSG.
The maximum transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million for the French Paul Pogba.
PSG owns a state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The Chairman of the Society is former tennis professional, qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
The success writer Raija Oranen browsed alcoholism and flight fear with hypnosis: "I'm in my life"
From the TV series, Rose's time and pure white sheets were just celebrated by his 69-year-old success writer Raija Oranen.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren like their grandmothers while taking the writing alongside Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish Sun and Fuengirola apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring, the rental apartment also left.
To light and sun, away from the old circles of Raijan once took depression and alcoholism from which he survived.
The external nature is 20 pounds lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mood medicines.
Alcoholism was used to help with hypnosis, which also worked for a flight fear, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes a person, a radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have traveled the same journey for more than 45 years.
I'm better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen has been working in the tourism sector for more than 40 years.
I asked, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That kind of drama queen has always been, ending his life with that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen only remembers 44 parts of the pure white sheets of the TV series that touched and moved the lama time in Finland.
I finally decided to become the Raikkaan family company industry when I read a 50-year interview in the plane in Liisa Seppälä.
I was the daughter of a sewingman myself, my mother also had a clothing movement, and sometimes I acted as a mannekine, Oranen remembers.
The story and the story of the series changed the attitude of Finnishs to entrepreneurship.
Anita Saven's research and the argument revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for active time, he has many scripts under work - ideas for hundreds.
The Circles returned over the "millions alley"
The most wealthy owners of the West Midlands are once again hairy with superficial circulars who managed to cross the city's mine and return to the area next to the houses.
Circulars park a couple of decades of trailers near the street called the alley of millionaires in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the city's premiere, and they brought with them children, horses, and the army of trucks.
The circulars succeeded in crossing the barrier that had been left unprotected for the path.
Solihull's municipality has been accused of "complete inability to solve the problem".
Anonymous resident tells us that the visitors came from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had thrown passers on stones.
“The power must be hardened to act because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The circulars were here in May, and then they left, but they returned again.
“They came more and more likely today.”
The resident told me that Birmingham's municipality had solved the problem by banning access to the parks.
"Asun Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal taxes when the municipality can't do anything."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the visitors returned so soon after they were driven away.
“They have been more than before, and they have even landed the horse to the park.
According to Solihull's informant, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihull police to eliminate campers as soon as possible.
In order to collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report to the police about disturbing or criminal activities.
It helps to create an overall picture of the situation for judicial treatment."
Angered people surrounded Portugal’s devastating machine
In Portugal, men full of people on the beach have been interviewed today in court.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced bill.
The two men who flyed the plane can be charged with the injuries of death.
At the very least, it can have 16 years of imprisonment in Portugal.
A small machine flying by men had to make a technical mistake yesterday due to a forced bill to the Sao Joao da Caparica beach in the vicinity of Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach during the event, some of which ran the landing plane into the water.
The plane hit an 56-year-old man and a 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man who was on the back of the plane.
As soon as the plane got up, and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
The parents of the girl were not injured.
The coasters surrounded the small machine immediately after the crash were angry.
The daughter’s father and other people went to the plane and began to beat it, told the case in the Celia Rocha Correio da Manha magazine.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people are dead.
The two men on the plane were not injured in a forced bill.
The tragic loss of his leg was once again won by the MM: “I would not be the world champion.”
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrates early Wednesday morning Finnish time MM-kulta at a banked slalom in the Canadian Big White competition.
The Great Hamari won the cross of the MM gold in the races.
There are already three MM tiles.
What an incredible MM contest!
Two times treated with gold, quite a good heartbeat is pulled, the phone-accessed Grand Hamari rejoiced.
The 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to the Great Hamar, the number of pests in the species is growing all the time.
The whole paralymical boarding has grown and evolved very much in recent times.
Differences decrease, and there are many new calculators involved.
He always wonders if there's a black horse.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Big Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had fallen enthusiasticly with his friends since he was young, and the accident didn’t take him to the chest.
It reminds me of what my life would be like without the accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's worth it.
These cards play what is shared, the Great Hamari emphasises.
It would be cruel to deceive a serious accident and lose a limb into a happiness, and the Great Hamari does not.
But he turned out a terrible difficulty to the benefit of it.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned out to be a win.
I wouldn't be a third-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the biggest ferry entrance of the 23-year-old Suur-Hamar was already shaving.
Duuni went to the top only after the accident.
I trained with friends when I was young, and we always killed X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that swollen some time.
After the accident, I found myself somewhere on the X-Games start.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I wondered that this would be a very long life if I stayed here to bite and mourn.
I decided to pull the suits on my back and start working.
I'd say I've succeeded pretty well.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of Leo-Pekka Star as an athlete of the year.
The four-fold Olympic winner received a prize in the sports gallery held in January.
According to the Great Hamar, the victory of the Star is an important signal for the paraurgy.
It was a very big thing, and the win was definitely earned.
This must also open eyes to the world of parade sports.
When is it time to launch a double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar athlete campaign?
Then we'll see it in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
The Great Hamari has not conquered all the tops of the desire.
Next year, there is a big goal.
A year later, the Paralympians will be visited in South Korea.
We're going to get some medals!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country.
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees are baking bread in the refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their country permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the leaving of Ishis is the most important things that should happen in order to return to their homeland.
Trump’s government does not see a change in Syria’s conflict.
Burson-Marsteller explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the views and attitudes of Arabs in nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 people aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half men, responded to the study.
Half of the interviews were made in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42% of the respondents might think they would return to their homeland and 4% could not say.
According to the study, the young people’s return to home is most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the ending of the war to be the most impressive factor for permanent return to home, while the quarter thinks the most important thing is Isis leaving the country.
Only less than a tenth increases the most important factors in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military actions do not solve conflict alone
The Syrian youths were asked which factor is the most important factor for the resolution of the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more important than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter of Al-Assad's presidentship is an obstacle to the peace treaty.
Nearly half of them feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current Syrian conflict.
To solve the conflict by means of mere military action, it is not just a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees see the power of Isis deteriorated over the last year, while the fifth experiences its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important battle for the fathers, and usually against terrorism, is that the media would provide people with information that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Nearly as many put military measures as well as training reform into priority.
For the tenth, the most important thing would be to create better jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of Trump’s regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during Trump’s regime.
Nearly every fourth believes the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump.
The opinions are divided into two points as to whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding in order to keep online in order - the database he develops, for example, Wikipedia and Google.
The Espoo company MariaDB develops the "the fastest growing" open source database.
The main product founded by the coding entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, MariaDB, does not pay any money to users, and it can be developed online by any advanced programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paid by customers.
With the help of databases, huge data masses will remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use MariaDB or MySQL database.
“All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked to it,” Widenius explains.
MariaDB's technology manager Widenius spends about half of his time coding.
A beautiful man who works remotely with his hands contributes to ensuring that the internet works meltingly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database for MySQL in conjunction with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun purchased MySQL with a billion dollars, and a year later, Oracle lost its software with 7.4 billion of Sun.
When the Oracle trade took place, most of the developers of MySQL announced that they were leaving.
“They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not give a certain promise of the future of MySQL,” Widenius recalls.
He had already founded a company that started developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life to die.
I hired the best developers from Sun and made sure the continuity of the code is secured by the same friends that created it.
Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
All I had to do was change the name.
A foundation was established to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"In MySQL, these assurances were not made," Widenius troubles.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL’s billion stores, few Finns know nothing about MariaDB.
“For the last few years, our growth rate has been about 50% per year,” says MariaDB’s economic leader Kenneth Paqvalén.
MariaDB focuses on growth is not yet profitable, and Paqvalén is weakened by the company's characteristics.
This is how she reveals that during the current financial year MariaDB estimates that she will receive orders of EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around which business customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be more than a year’s career if the client has used a closed database.
A switch from MySQL to MariaDB will be successful in a moment because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the largest bank DBS in Southeast Asia is the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest DBS in Southeast Asia.
The most popular cloud services such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating systems distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we are a small company, we have contacts with the biggest players.
“Our clients include the world’s largest teleoperators, gaming companies, banks, and even some central bank,” Paqvalén said.
The database market is still in existence by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
Oracle also MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although the research company Gartner said that the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, the players like MariaDB in turnover are still infinite, although fast-growing sints.
About $50 billion in the database market, the open source databases are not even up to a billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in cash, because most users do not pay any of these software.
Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies are already developing more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been switched to open or at least started.
Big companies do not receive new customers because most of them choose the open source code.
This has led to the fact that the license fees for commercial databases have jumped into clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to do with a smaller number of customers,” Widenius thinks.
Since the exchange of a closed database is difficult, most of the customers have neglected price increases.
“There are a lot of customers to whom transfer is very difficult because their old applications and others are closed in the closed database,” Widenius says.
He still believes that the customer’s size is coming to full.
When license fees increase every year, the customer will move sooner or later to the open source database.
The price is 10-20% of the previous, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants to.
Moreover, many companies are facing major system changes when they transfer their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million loan from the European Investment Bank.
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now intended to hire more.
One of the reasons for the EIB’s funding was MariaDB’s impact on public projects.
The company has customers in the public sector, for example in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually for databases.
“Most countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax funds more efficiently,” Paqvalén said.
Widenius is concerned about how money is spent in Finland, such as closed health systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not in the mercy of a single software company.
Some say that the open source code is ideology, but I think it is a better way to make the code.
The community will help and do something that is not invented or able to do.
55-year-old Widenius is part of another Finnish Linux developer Linus Torvalds, along with the most famous open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies develop operating business models on an open source code.
I still have 4-5 talks every year around the world on this subject.
Italy hardens its attitude to NGO rescues
Italy has warned NGOs that save refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they must not continue their activities unless they commit to complying with new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to a new code of action, it is difficult to see how they could continue their activities," Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin La Stampa newspaper.
Minnit’s warning came from a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated the German Jugend Rettet’s ship. The crew was suspected to cooperate with human smugglers, which promoted illegal immigration.
Only for a year, the aid organisation refused to comment on the detailed accusations of the prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
“The saving of human lives is and will be the most important for us, and we are very sorry that we are not currently able to act in the search and rescue area,” the organization announced in its opinion in social media.
“We can only evaluate the accusations after we have gathered all the information we need and we can evaluate the situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa ship of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew was suspected to have taken refugees by boats directly from human smugglers who reintroduced the boats.
One such case is alleged to have occurred only a few kilometres from the Libyan coast; the information is shown in the document of the prosecutor whose content has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of being threatened by the Italian Coast Guard, which supervises the rescue measures in the region. The motivation is considered to be the enthusiasm of helping.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa should be involved in an Italian police officer who supervises operations.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue measures have agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS as well as the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced Thursday that it considered new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the rescue of the organization.
The Nobel Prize Doctors Without Borders is among those who refuse to comply with the Code of Conduct.
On the other hand, Minniti stated that the number of migrants arrived in Italy has dramatically decreased over the last few weeks, which he considers as evidence that action to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local city leaders will begin to produce results.
“In the last days, light has started to appear at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He revealed that this month the plans will continue discussions with the Libyan city leaders on economic development projects, as well as with Chad, Niger and Mali, on measures to reduce the number of refugees moving towards Europe.
The prosecutor was suspected to have killed his open partner in the Enontekie, the suspect was found in the scenery - the case for the prosecutor
The suspected crime occurred in the Enontekio's Kuttas last December.
According to the police, a Czech 36-year-old man was suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish open spouse.
In the past, both were seasonal workers.
The police have also said that the suspect would have fled to the ground with two dogs since his action.
The man was found cold in the ground, and he did not resist when he was captured.
We're gonna have to file the accusation in a few weeks.
The case may be settled in Lapland’s court in August.
Harry Potter and All Hairy from my friend, Robert Hardy, is dead.
The British actor Robert Hardy died at the age of 91.
The actor's death reported this family on Thursday.
Hardy, born in 1925, started his actor career at the theatre at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also played films and television.
Hardy is particularly reminded of the role of the magical minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and of his veterinarian role in the James Herriot book-based All-Free TV series.
The BBC’s popular series was described through seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for suicide messages
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment for text messages and calls in which she was thought to be inspired by her boyfriend Conrad Roy's suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, takes 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years in probation.
Carter was sentenced to murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13.7.2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said in the Thursday session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for an appeal to the court and was able to wait for an application to be handled in freedom.
He was threatened by 20 years of judgment, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Carter, who dressed in red pants and cream-colored shirt, listened to the hands of his judgment in the cross with a crying look on the ground.
"He's actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
“He decided Conrad’s life to heal his own.
He has not taken responsibility," the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown repentance."
Carter's attorney said the case was due to the “faithful circumstances that Carter deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz thought that Carter’s “age or maturity level and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions.”
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement in which my mother said, "Not going to take a day not to die the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all of this. I am trying to comfort his sister in this pain that we will always carry.”
Conrad’s sister Camdyn Roy told the court that he was “conscious” of the idea that he would never see his brother’s wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"It's painful to lose a person that's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain never calms," Camdyn said.
The case seems to be a precedent, because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that imposing suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the car to be dead in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had been inspiring his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
“High yourself, jump from the roof, stabble yourself. I don’t know, there are many ways,” Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy in two weeks before this death. Roy was on vacation with his family at that time.
Just a little before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter was looking for attention at Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
Only few have defended Carter. One of the defendants is Amanda Knox, 30 sentenced to the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion, which says, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
Secretary General of NATO: The worst in Russia then the Cold War
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukraine conflict.
I believe that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been after the end of the cold war, Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the cold war, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, especially after the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and due to the continuous instability caused by Russia in the Eastern Ukraine region, NATO’s relationship with Russia has significantly deteriorated.
According to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to doing so that tensions do not increase.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the exaggeration of the situation and the new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, President Donald Trump was able to find that between the United States and Russia was even at a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged us to congratulate the poor congress of the countries that adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the retreat of car manufacturers
The day before Aud announced the BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
The BMW Director said the company believes that "There are more reasonable alternatives than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including the BMW home town of Munich, which consider limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies were talking about a return call.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve the carbon emissions targets.
Hydrogen emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
Installation costs of emissions neutralising equipment are increasing, making cars difficult to price competitively.
German car manufacturers are strictly monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of bringing together major car companies and ignoring problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's errors. Volkswagen installed scam equipment on cars that reduced emissions to compliance with the requirements of the tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged with charges in the United States, but the actions of the leaders are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director of Aud’s engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in the Volkswagen criminal investigation, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent European emissions requirements. The accusation was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Aud’s investigation can significantly undermine Volkswagen’s position: the proportion of the luxury car manufacturer’s Volkswagen’s wins is unrelatively high.
Venezuela's vote began a fair investigation, big protests on promise
According to the company, the number of voters notified by the Venezuela authorities is at least million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election performance, the President of the National Election Board Tibisay Lucena said to journalists.
Maduro assures the crisis to end
In Venezuela, on Sunday, a controversial vote was elected by a representative office to amend the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised protests against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own protests so that they will be in progress at the time of appointment.
According to El Pais, the national security forces of the country began to take over local time on Wednesday.
The teams are intended to ensure the safety of the appointment event.
Climate change threatens Provence's laventel
Laventel has become a symbol of the South French Provence region, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Laventeli was reduced due to insects carrying droughts and diseases. Researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Laventeli is directly threatened in Provence's region because it has suffered the impact of climate change in recent years, which has led to a clear fall in spring and especially in autumn rainfalls," says Eric Chaisse, an expert in the CRIEPPAM Research Institute, which specializes in agriculture in Provence.
“This reduces the lifetime of the laventel.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cakes that spread microbacteria."
The bets are tough.
Laventeli oil attracts travelers, and it is also a very desired ingredients of fragrance waters and cosmetics.
“In addition to small stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened or missing completely,” Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer parts of ethical oil."
The solution is sought by improving watering, slowing down soil humidity and spraying plants with a protective shaft and water mix. In addition, more sustainable varieties are developed.
The murder of the journalist manifests a growing threat in Mexico
Once a week’s delivery of the Riodoce newspaper will usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss how the journal deals with the latest cases related to organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of recent tragedy.
Suppliers have been advised to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leave the children home or take them in the delivery of a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. There is no need for evidence, observations and feelings are sufficient.
The titles of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected to be on board boards or drug cartels, are criminals who make mexican chaos life-threatening.
According to the Supplier Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered after President Enrique Peña Nieto entered office in December 2012, 589 journalists have been under attacks and threats. In the current year, at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, supplier and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply dignified, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building covers a huge picture where Valdez looks like a middle finger. The picture reads: "The right." The three-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez have dressed in T-shirts that decorate Valdez's smile-s face. Valdez has glasses and pan-marked.
The meeting will take less than two months after the death of Valdez, and journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoid fears.
In 2010, the federal prosecutor’s office was established, in particular for the processing of the cases of suppliers, but, according to the Defence Committee of Suppliers, only two accusations have been raised.
Suppliers are rarely subject to justice, as well as thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organised crime annually will be brought to justice.
Riodoce’s journalists will continue to write about Sinalo’s violence, even though they are broken by sorrow and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is just a little useful because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
“This meeting is a waste of time,” he says.
“We can’t trust anyone until we know the cause of the event.”
Valdez was withdrawn from Riodoce’s delivery in Culiacan, the state’s capital city, in the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had only drove a few blocks in the red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots.
The shooter drove away with Valdez's car and crashed it some way away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left to mourn her wife and two adult children.
The rumors move quickly and debt freely in Culiacan.
However, the death of Valdez is a mouse silence.
Sinaloa has been the most bloody battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and expelled to the United States in January.
On Sinalo’s streets, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has decorative two-layer grave buildings that are larger than many homes.
In the coastal state, there is a "rest" when only one cartel controls ports and drug traffic routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published a Damaso Lopez interview, leading a competing group who is going to war against Guzman's sons.
The case could be upset by Guzman's boys: the customers suspected of being members of the gang bought each number of the magazine as soon as the newspaper came to the sales points.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after the same case was published.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is regarded as a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroesthe, when he decided in 2003 to establish with five colleagues in Riodoce. The magazine’s shares were sold at the time of $50.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the magazine began to feel about the bold and honest things, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
The journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish a hard class of research journalism without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinating in the newspaper of stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after he was established, Riodoce won the Prize of Maria Moors Cabot for his news in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize of the Defense Committee of Suppliers for the courage to follow the Mexican Drug Trading story.
He admitted he was openly afraid.
"I want to continue my life," he said when he received the Award of the Defence Committee of Suppliers.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a "lifestyle", Valdez said Rompeviento TV interview last October.
“The Customer has to accept a task that falls to him – or play stupid.
I don’t want anyone to ask me where I was when I was bathing death – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
Riodoce staff need Valdez – a joker who cursed as a port worker. They need a friend who always had a hug and advice. They need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routines.
He always used a pancake hat.
He went to the opposite El Guayabo bar and sat at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines were his destiny.
The death of a colleague has also led them to reflect on how they can best do their work and stay alive.
Criminals don’t like it if we deal with their women and children and their pure business, their secret drug trafficking runs.
They were left out of things," Bojorquez said.
In the best case, it meant strong self-defense and self-defense,
Trusting their own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem is, according to Riodoce’s journalist Andres Villarreal, that “the impression can be deceived, and that’s what happened in Javier’s case.”
The old rules no longer apply to Sinalo, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where Riodoce’s safety training was held. A few days earlier, it had been revealed that only spies sold to governments had been followed by activists and suppliers in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought to protect the tree's shadow from the 40 degrees helmet.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's offices, located in a four-round building in the middle-class Culiacan region.
Some journalists reviewed half of their plays, whether these two police officers were part of the 50% number that the governor of the state did not consider to be reliable.
It has been months since the journalists had been in the mountainous countryside controlled by the drug gangs.
This week, Riodoce's delivery was designed for three main things.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper was also going to reveal that the government’s money was focused on the city of the governor’s home.
In addition, together with Culiacan’s most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the prosecutor’s office, a group of people were kidnapped.
There was no official information about who was kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of the politicians of the institutional revolutionary party (PRI). PRI has managed Mexico's policy at all levels for almost a century.
The governors involved have recently been accused of corruption in many cases of publicity.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place, and in one of them, "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid a military ride.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they would have received reliable information about Valdez’s column kidnapping.
“We would have known what had happened earlier,” says Villarreal, a 46-year-old, who has received a hobby because of his body structure, the favorite name “El Flaco”, Ohukainen.
“Now all the connections to our data sources are broken.”
Valdez's work room has been converted into a stock where journalists are retention against persecution. Journalists have received a new, unexpected task: they have become press-free activists.
The journalist, Miriam Ramirez, took with him a few signs after he left the next morning to represent the local prosecutor’s office for a demonstration, which was the cause of the new journalist’s murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the West Michoacan State three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Suppliers have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country. In the opinions of footways and buildings, the texts “SOS Press” appear.
Today, Bojorquez is in Washington, where he tries to get international support for the investigation of the case of Valdez.
On the day following Valdez's murder, Ramirez met the governor Sinalo and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they tell the truth.
He has since asked him to be moved away from government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists are surrounded by organised crime, criminal authorities and an indifferent society in Mexico.
In his last book, Narco-Jurnalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by the order of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to Articulo 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were the result of police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are quieted by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a depressing effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the North Tamaulipas border state six years ago.
At her body, there was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my writings."
Aside from his head cut off, there was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to terminate their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the North Chihuahua border state after the Marchal murder of Miroslava Breach.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to drug maps: “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
The decision is difficult.
It is difficult to find a job in the countryside, and all the time you need to be careful.
Sometimes criminals are looking for a journalist in their hands, as apparently went to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in four women in the apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who used to be a poet, admits that writing about the drug store is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on the way to hell," he says.
A while ago, Riodoce’s journalists sat in front of the delivery on Friday midnight with a footway beer when the latest number of the magazine was finished.
In a shooting between competing gangs and security forces at the Mazatlan coastal site, 19 people were killed.
The war has accelerated, as was promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Suppliers put the news on the Riodoce website on their footway with their smartphones.
The front page had to be reintroduced the next day.
The sirens flooded nearby – a new shooting attack again.
Bojorquez looked at security police:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The delivery of Riodoce continued the tradition of the founder who was murdered in the magazine under this massive image, where the man shows the middle finger to the whole Sinalo.
Bojorquez says that you can’t even consider terminating the action. “How can I stop the magazine when our trainer asked you to get on the street to do the thing on the same day that Javier was murdered?”
The Hannu Mannisen Olympic project began with a huge back-up - "Strong place"
In April 39, Hannu Manninen’s celebration remained short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the exercise period began with disaster when Manninen was inflamed.
It started a long period of sickness, which took almost five weeks.
May went to a full illness in practice.
At first, there was flu and finally a child’s disease like an ear inflammation that I had to eat an antibiotic curtain.
I was able to make only 10% of the scheduled exercises.
I don't remember when I've been so sick for the last time.
It was a tough place when I didn't get used to internship, Manninen tells me about the Ilta-Sanom.
Test result collapsed
The World Championship of 2007 was granted only in the second week of June, which was shown in the Kilpa and Excellent Sports Research Centre of June 12.
In the test, the athlete skis with rolls on a carpet, the speed of which is grown every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the mat stops for about 10 seconds, and the tester takes a milk acid sample from the finger of the athlete with the needle.
Last autumn episodes on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
Fire against the wall, Manninen tells me.
In a better direction
After the initial rights, Manninen says he was healthy.
I have done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises that I have tried to normalize the metabolism of the body.
Now there is a really good five-week period.
It was also a half-week holiday for flight work.
I also had time to go to the house with my family.
In the last season, Manninen only participated in four world-cup competitions before the Lahde MMs.
The best result was seen in the opening competition as Manninen rose to the top 18th.
Direct lines watered
Petter Kukkonen, the main coach of the Manninen and the country team, has made an internship and competition plan until February.
We are now looking for a different sort of rhythm compared to the last season.
After the first races, Ruka would have a weekend of three world cups.
In December, at least one of the world cup weekends, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plans would still be involved in Seefeld.
I hope that the name will be found on the list of the Olympic team, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be the sixth Winter Olympics for Mannis.
Now, the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City in 2002, celebrated a nommel underline of gold in the team competition.
Dinosaurus protected his enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
The researchers have now revealed the first research results of the creature of the size of the sarvikuon found by the Canadian mining worker, which had been so well preserved that experts call it the dinosaurs of Mona Additionali.
It was so well preserved that researchers could even define that its Finnish skin was red brown and had a "probable past".
According to the current Biology magazine, it is the best preserved panssarized dinosaur and the best representatives of its world species.
Recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which was 110–112 million years ago in the middle stages of the accession period.
Researchers consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil as a very significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the armored vegetarian is the best preserved fossil in its species.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was found by Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn’t seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to explore his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the royal paleontological museum of Tyrrelli.
For six years, the beast was dug out of 100 pounds.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
“If you are squeezing your eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping,” says researcher Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrelli.
“It remains in the history of science in the dinosaurs of Mona Lisana, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The studies found that dinosaurs eating meat were likely to be a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though they had a armor and it reminded me of a walking tank.
Its red-white armor masks its predators, and it was also protected by darker and lighter coloring, which still occurs in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to mix with its environment and avoid enemies, larger dinosaurs.
A 110 million-year-old nodosaurus rose to titles in May, and is now sampled in the royal paleontologic museum of Tyrrelli.
The researchers have given it a name from Borealope to markmitchelli, according to Mark Mitchell, a museum technician, and Mitchell belonged to a team from which he took over 7,000 hours to dig a dinosaur.
The Nodosaurus has remained so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shapes of the body's bowls and panzer.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general color, where the body is darker and lighter.
The observation was still a surprise because Borealope is significantly larger than existing animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the dinosaurs eating meat preyed in such a way that evolution is the preferred way to survive hiding instead of fighting.
Of existing animals, for example, peuros, seepros and armadillos have similar coloring. They are significantly smaller and therefore easier to catch, which suggests that nodosaurs were seriously threatened.
"The prey of a large, strongly armed dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Union season were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of Nodosaur's organic compounds reveals that its skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to study nodosaurs in order to make conclusions on its life. They study, among other things, its intestinal content to find out what it ate in their last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell in the river when it died and went to the sea where it fell on the bottom of the sea.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as today in Florida, and the rivers and the sea were likely to reach far further than today.
“This nodosaurus is really significant because its Finnish skin has been preserved and has also been maintained in a three-dimensional form of its original form,” Brown says.
“This is why it looks almost the same as in the early period of accession.
It’s not a lot of imagination: if you squeeze a little eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping.”
The season was the era of teropods, huge two-length dinosaurs eating meat.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years earlier, Borealopelta, its great predecessors may have caught this armed dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex predecessors included Acrocanthosaurus, about 11.5 meters long six-ton monster.
The latest findings of Nodosaur researchers have been published in the Current Biology magazine. They believe that Borealope was drowning in the sea after his death and mudified into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was found by Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it’s the world’s best-sustained armored dinosaur with leather and pants to the hip.
The Nodosaurs were on average five meters long and weighed up to 1 300 kilograms.
There were two half-metres of pipes on their stages.
Researchers believe that this armored vegetarian went through the current West Canada until the flooded river moved it to the open sea.
Its armor has preserved small details in the underwater grave.
The fossilized residues have remained so well that its skin remains in the piles of the panzer along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such preservation is "one rare than a lottery win.
The more you see it, the more amazing it feels.
Its callopans are still fossilated leather.
Its right front foot is on its side, five toes upwards.
I can also count the bowls of that foot base."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Whose streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9.8.2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home from St. Louis and sat on his airbnb bed to browse Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed the message from his high schoolmate:
"The police just killed a 18-year-old young man, and his body is still on the street."
When he was confused, he noted that no one else had posted the same information to his feed. That's why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous re-twists from @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a sniper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death. White police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black brown in Ferguson in Missouri State.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter the same night, people were told to gather on Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police locking tapes and screaming people, as well as Brown’s father-in-law, who was wearing a sign: “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
Ferrell followed a real-time video recording where the police stood in front of the protesters with a dog that was hacking.
He also said he saw a video where the other police forced his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers.
“It wasn’t a murder we’ve already been used to and could be called typical.
Then I felt cold colors.
I was angry and I was crying."
He booked a return trip home for the next day.
Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter's father and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson within the next three years has been done by a documentary film "Whose Streets"?
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, strength and silence from the point of view of the local people who left on the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson to the flower mechanics and his daughter who was dressed with it, they went back to a discussion about “what is living in black and in what conditions”. They had spoken about it countlessly before that morning.
“Do you remember when I told you how blacks have had to fight for the things they believe in?” Ferrell remembers his saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and it's not right."
"I couldn't ignore my daughter," Ferrell told me later.
“The events of this day are the summit of past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow it.
He must gain the capacity to activism and organization, but he must also recognize the different layers and conditions of the experience of living as black. And he must know what we have to do to free ourselves.
Fortunately, though I have been able to protect him from racism, he is still similar to the other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop at Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station. It became an activist camp site, waiting for information on the case and finally found out that no charges would be filed against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to react to activism in a new way.
"Activism changed completely after 9 August," he said. When he studied at Missour University in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of a minority nurse's organization. At that time he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
"Something it just happened."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met in the evening opinion of Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the document.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar “will simply tell me what was happening.
He said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story you can use?"
In the background of the doubt, they were countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually white people who wanted only to benefit from its difficulties and silence.
“We had heard that Ferguson’s born and growing people had no common voice,” Folayan said in the interview recently. “We wanted to do things differently.”
Folayan had already contacted deputy director Damon Davis, known for his activism with the prisoners who were killed.
Davis' involvement led Ferrelli to take part in the project together with six other locals, followed the shooting of Brown in the following years.
“This is not a documentary in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak,” Davis says.
“I was the most important thing about how local people are present in the movie because I’m being presented in the same way.”
According to Folayan, it was not intended to focus on Ferrelli’s experiences because it was desired to show that “the movement is not a charismatic leader but a community.” However, Ferrell proved to be the most transparent.
Therefore, the document sees surprising private aspects of Ferrelli’s life, such as love and marriage.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he told me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and black human photography require certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrelli’s story once and again will bring back the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The business was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot a black teen boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two founders of the movement are identical to the queer identity.
"The leadership of the Muslim queer women has maintained the entire movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
The black queer women have had to endure everything.”
Folayan agrees: “The movement is indeed maintained by black women with many queer women.”
However, he stresses that Ferrelli was not selected in the document "self-relevant" because of its queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan said.
“It’s not a coincidence that she was in the front line. Black queer women live in a lot of things at the cutting point, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is transmitted from the white fabric.”
The news description groups have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the intercourse between the community and the police remains tense.
Ferrelli still has two and a half years of parole left, and he was sentenced to block the motorway at the demonstration.
His description of the social political atmosphere of his home corners is short and core: "Single."
Nevertheless, he still trusts in the attack sentence he learned outside Ferguson's streets three years ago:
“Our sovereignty is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.”
Suitable similarity: the artist creates images of Chelsea Manning DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has been hanged in the middle of the exhibition space of the faces – white, black and brown faces, which can be more closely viewed as to identify the equivalence.
These 30 works are images made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples of Fort Leavenworth's prison in which he executed his 35-year sentence. Manning was condemned for the secretly classified diplomatic telegrams leaking on the WikiLeaks site.
The Dewey-Hagborgin A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It has two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art. Manning is a transnate and uralizing contraconception, whose prison sentence Barack Obama alleviated his term of office on the third day.
Dewey-Hagborg analysed the DNA of Manning algorithmically and created 30 formats based on its gene data. They are sharp, although a bit of theoretical position on the reconciliation of DNA data, multidisciplinity and interpretations based on cause-related consequences and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born in Bradley Edward, has openly told women that they have been identical to women since the break-in, and that he was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Manning, condemned in prison, was only one picture: a grain, black-white selfie, where the painted Manning sits in the car at the driver's seat. He has a platinum wax on his head, which became his character.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a great popular Stranger Visions project that he carried out in 2012.
That's where he created photographs based on criminal technical information. He got DNA data, for example, about cigarettes and chews, and created pictures of what those people might have been able to look like.
Then the artist received an e-mail from the Paper Magazine magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Mannig and needed a picture of their stories," Dewey-Hagborg told me a new exhibition at the press conference.
He couldn't visit Manning, and he couldn't be photographed in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making a DNA image of Manning.
The artist and his captured music suddenly became correspondent companions, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even made a series of Suppressed Images, which was imagined by Shoili Kanungo. It described the future in which the president would have relieved Chelsea's judgment and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning's judgment only a few days after the publication of the comic book, and it was a fortunate coincidence after seven severe years in the National Military Prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now when Donald Trump takes his own war against information leaks and transsexual soldiers and invents new ways in Twitter to strengthen the powerful tribes he actually had to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that “everything has its purpose.”
On the wall of Galleria, there is an artist’s statement, and under it the great signature of Manning, where the name i is the heart. In his opinion, the artist demands the end of the "automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture have been based."
The opposite wall has the DNA cycle of Manning: a long line of C, G and A letters written on the lead pen.
With this 200 letters – or the scientific definition of the nucleotide used by the artist – the combination of Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are, at least our biology.
“I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal from our gene tradition and that genetic data are very personal and open to interpretations,” Dewey-Hagborg says. The exhibition also presents his Spurious Memories video from 2007.
"DNA tells me countless stories, and there are 30 of them here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: page of the Manning and Dewey-Hagborg Cartoon Book.
That's where Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
“If they make you quiet, they have won,” the picture says.
"Don't ever shut up."
"Teksti is from the letter I got from Manning," said the artist from Philadelphia.
“It’s so impressive that I still get cold colors.”
Unlike the comic book described, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he greeted his own gene data based on his face as a group of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, as is everything else in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA period is written on a lead pen on a height similar to its length (157,5 cm).
“The faces were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring them a crowd to feel,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind his release."
The Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee are being searched for murder suspected
The police say they have launched national searches to find a professor of Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, suspected of stabbing a man to death in a chicagoly luxury home.
The records of the Cook County Law show that on Monday, arrest orders were issued on Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of the involvement of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after he was stabbed several times.
According to the local news published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
The police alarmed the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with several wounds in their bodies.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing was investigated as a murder, actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a assistant professor in microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Vice-President Alan K. Cubbage on social relations at the University said in an e-mail opinion that Lathem is now free of administrative charge and is prohibited from access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a crime that the authorities are investigating, and the Northwestern University helps in the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as an older financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
The statement sent by the e-mail of the University and Somerville College states that “We have been in contact with the police in the UK and we are ready to help the authorities investigating the case in the United States in all possible ways.”
In addition, the opinion stated that Mr Warren’s colleagues are shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, CEO of the Chicago Police Department, said that he called on the suspects to give seriously to the authorities.
“Police has an understanding of their location, and we constantly clarify our searches,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping searches for suspects.
He told the police that he received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, who had received an indefinite hint that there was something in the apartment 1008.
The police described the appearance at the scene to be terrible.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told me the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza Management Group published the following communication to the inhabitants: "The police would currently investigate the course of events and the background of the victim and possible motivations, including the possibility of domestic violence."
The man threatened to blow up the Islamic bookstore and kill Muslims in London
"I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic," said the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced to explode the Islamic bookstore in London and "to kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was condemned, among other things, for gross harassment.
According to the police, they were alerted by the bookstore staff on 23 May.
According to the staff, the man was threatened to explode the bookstore and kill the Muslims.
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police for a threat.
The threat was not related to the events of the book trade.
The authorities found that Moffatt had dressed in the same way as a suspect in the bookstore, the police reporter said.
I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt said to the police in interrogation.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay 620 pounds, i.e. the legal costs of about 690 euros and 85 pounds, i.e. the compensation of approximately 95 euros for victims.
According to Scotland Yard's report, several hate crimes are left unreported.
"We will complete the activities under the WADA Roadmap in the near future" – Vice-President Vitaly Mutko
Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the activities under the World Antidoping Office’s WADA Roadmap to restore the powers of the Russian Antidoping Commission RUSADA.
"Osa's roadmap measures have already been carried out, and RUSADA was entitled to design and test in cooperation with the UKAD of the UKAD of the United Kingdom Antidoping Commission.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap, which sets out the conditions for the return of RUSADA's powers. The second part of the road map was recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything worrying for Russia.
"Everything has been reported, and everything is implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and to WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points of the roadmap requires the Russian antidoping authorities to publicly approve the results of the study by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren investigates the state's alleged share in the Russian sport doping.
Mutko said, "The study is underway because our antidoping system has acknowledged the failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes and we cannot admit something that did not exist."
Mutko said there were glides on the opinion of the President of the Russian independent public antidoping committee, Vitaly Smirnov.
Earlier on the same day, Smirnov said to the Russian RSport sports media that there have been problems with the Russian antidopings. "We have said several times that the report has been controversial on the positions and regulations.
We will not accept the report without any conditions," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015 when the scope of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June, it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA's director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow in July. After his visit, he found that the organization was on a "right road" towards the return of powers.
The British organization skeptical to Finnishs for loving innovation: "There is no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packs"
The British organization suspects the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packs.
Among other things, BBC and Guardian tells us that the Lullaby Trust organization that fights hiding deaths prohibits the use of their own brochures in maternity packs distributed in the UK.
Distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women begins this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that a maternity pack would reduce the risk of concealing death.
Death is an unexplained death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust serves as a UK health authority expert in the field of a child’s safe sleep.
We no longer allow our official brochures to be packed to them because it would let us understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
In Finland, one of the lowest child mortality figures in the world, only two dead thousand people born.
According to Lullaby Trust, the good reading of Finland is a result of many different reasons, such as a small number of teenage diseases.
The fact that each family is given a box may be one factor.
However, that cannot be said, Lullaby Trust's CEO Francine Bates said.
We are concerned that maternity packs are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and hidden deaths.
Maternity packaging is a Finnish invention, and it has been given free to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains various equipment, such as children's clothes.
This year, there are 53 products in the pack.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which a child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes that they share meet all security standards.
In turn, Lullaby Trust says there is no security standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to Lullaby Trust, the packaging can be the best option for a place to sleep if there is no cradle or soil bed available.
The organization recommends using the packaging only for a day’s sleep and stop using it at the time the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from the packaging and making sure it does not get wet or dirty.
The Vikkelä villain escaped from the Japanese zoo
The Japanese zoo staff is looking for a karanished turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and has fled to repeat in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okama, Western Japan on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, working in the zoo.
A 35-year-old villain is female, 55 pounds and about a metre long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain can walk freely in the garden area.
The zoo has not received eyewitnesses from the turtle.
The previous runaway of the dog happened in the second week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company avoid Uber errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure employees’ satisfaction in their online trading startup company, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often indispensable, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some of the employees suspiciously responded to them.
"The questions were simply not consistent and objective," said Errett. As his hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on online trade. The company has 75 employees.
He decided to take advantage of outside help.
More and more start-ups on the market have emerged, helping other companies to figure out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure the commitment of workers. Companies can do surveys and target them to certain teams and population groups, and provide unnamed notification services to their employees, and in some cases directly connect over the top management.
"Own health can be monitored by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where does Fitbit stay?" asks the founder and CEO Jim Barnett in Redwood City. Glint offers companies analytical software to measure the commitment of employees.
This has been using Glint's software for three years, and he says he has gained a deeper view of the ideas and feelings of his employees.
The program can make quick surveys and votes for certain teams. In addition, it can draw up a map of which you can see at a glance, in which departments employees are more unsatisfactory and which leaders have received the weakest assessments. On the basis of these, Youtt has been able to drilling into the core of problems.
Companies have understood that they need to follow the work culture so that they do not become the next Uber. The transport company has disappeared since the former employee wrote in his blog about the culture where workers are being harassed and punished by those who speak of problems.
For startups like Glint, such negligence is an attractive business opportunity.
Companies’ governance, regulation and conformity are a global industry whose value may rise to more than $ 118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.
Convercent, located in Denver, Colorado, is an startup that helps companies detect and prevent unnecessary use. Interesting about the company grew earlier this year when Uber’s reputation experienced a crash.
Convercent has almost 600 customers including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also made a deal with Uber recently.
Like Glint, Convercent gives companies the opportunity to make customized surveys, to collect answers confidentially in real time and to map problem areas.
In addition, workers may inform anonymously of an unauthorized behaviour by SMS.
And if a leader is to be doubted about inconvenience, complaints will go directly to the company’s government.
"The general opinion has excluded the authorities," says Convercent's founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
He recalls that if the company treats his employees poorly or acts unethically, the consequences may become expensive even if the authorities do not interfere with it. Consumers can begin to boiculate the company, and it can also lose employees and become challenged by the court.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25 000 employees at 500 offices. The company has used Convercent for more than a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the principles and procedures and that they can easily connect to the headquarters.
Previously, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find a phone number or email address that could make the notification to the headquarters. Then he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
“It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience,” said Ruby Tuesday’s lawyer James Vitrano. He said it was difficult to follow the complaints made by employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can now be detected and handled faster.
“I have a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee,” Vitrano says, leading to Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings related to employment relationships.
According to Quinlan, companies began to take more serious views on ethics, values and employee commitment after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activities in the Enron scandal.
Only with social media, companies understood that they could no longer prevent their dirty washing from exploring their publicly.
“The hope was used as a strategy before technology came to control ethics,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by capital investors. Both Glint and Convercent support capital investors.
Convercent collected $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February and has collected capital of $47 million.
Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has collected $60 million.
Investments are not a surprise in view of the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees are expecting more from their jobs.
Good wages in the competing market such as Piilaakson, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a genuinely useful company.
“The employees are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened and that their work is rewarding,” says Nina McQueen, director of the LinkedIn company for rewarding and well-being.
Investors receive profits when companies succeed. Companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen the commitment of workers, so it is no wonder they are interested in investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, it is important to know about the commitment of workers,
but it is useless if measures are not taken on the basis of it.
If the company requests feedback to his employees, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if the change does not come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you need to be prepared to conduct four thousand discussions,” says Cotter International, CEO Russell Raath, who has seen businesses rely on too much to collect information.
“If the company does not take action, the employees will start wondering if they have been heard.
And whether their opinions matter anything.
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to this, Madison Reed currently performs staff surveys every month and is able to deal with the problem on the same day as it is reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback from those who were frustrated with slow decision-making and communication quality, he was able to make changes to the teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday better understands its employees and hopes that deeper understanding will help to improve the persistence of staff in the long term in an industry known for the high variability of workers.
“If the company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees,” Vitrano says.
“If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no companies.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of smuggling his naked wife’s neighbor, says the news agency TT.
A woman in Göteborg had come out of the shower when she had noticed her cell phone hanging at the end of a node.
According to the woman, the cell phone camera took a picture of the apartment.
A woman who was scared of the case had run into another room to dress.
When a woman arrived to check the situation, the cell phone was pulled up first, but soon after that, it was recalculated in the window.
A suspected 20-year-old man has admitted that he was photographing a woman.
However, he claimed that he only described the face of a woman.
The video on the phone was removed and the police had not managed to restore it as evidence.
In interrogations, the man has admitted the action, but has refused to commit a crime.
The man that he described was justified by saying that he loves his neighbor as "insane."
According to the TT news agency, a case against a man is brought to the prosecution.
Teachers demand more liksa in autumn negotiations
The wage development cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the difference should be reduced, said OAJ President Olli Lukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cut of public holiday funds highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to enter into agreements that would otherwise not have been involved in the review.
In the municipal sector, contracts will only be concluded when the papers of the private sector are signed and the percentages are increased.
A rich predicts that, for example, the working terms of the OAJ have been agreed in January.
The targets of the Luxurious have not yet been revealed.
He is also President of Juko’s public-schooled negotiation organization.
Luxurious: Lodge cut increases earnings gaps
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is deteriorating while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to a number of people, the periodic holiday cut further increases the difference in earnings.
In Finland, how many students per one teacher can be
In addition, the OAJ notes that the equality of basic education needs to be ensured, as the best and weakest-suitable differences are increasing all the time.
According to the organization, learning results are weakening, and differences between students and regions are constantly increasing.
The day of Bruins players increased when NCAA reduced daily exercises in two to one
It's almost 11 o'clock in the evening, and a bunch of American football players in the UCLA have left to talk to the campus on the other side of the new training fields.
Some of them have taken off their shirts, and their backs shine from the sweat after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this couple of minutes of conversation is a noon break.
In the summer courses of the college, the players who are studying will return to the apartment after three hours of training to read the final tests. The next morning they will meet at the Wasserman football center at half seven.
"The next three days will be hard for these friends," Bruins coach Jim Mora said a little before Monday the change of Tuesday.
The supervisor’s roofing organization reduced the number of daily exercises in two together. The change was designed to reduce the number of players’ work, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the last final tests are held.
That’s why the first three exercises of UCLA began at 15 o’clock in the evening. The players were already in full schedules difficult to find space.
Limiting training times in one day means that there are more training days than before. This year, the camp began almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood coach period that continued through Mora six, while the exercises are held at the same time with summer courses.
Exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening of the season: UCLA meets the Texas A&M University in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA change in the rules, even though it made the players’ schedules even more stringent.
“We’re going to load them a lot for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think the situation will make it easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside the camp after the camp. It is not easy to take into account the direct view from the field to the next parking area and the Luskin Center, a flat hotel that has already been bombed over the protection network behind the paint.
Bruins players are expected to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can occur during the period when the rooms are available to outside.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
“It’s important that people can book a room and describe exercises from there to video. It’s not an overreached concern.
The video described in practice is paid a lot.
But we have guards there and the parking area.
We'll do our best.
I'm not gonna bother my head too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
In Rwanda, Central Africa, the presidential elections will be held on Friday, and the winner is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame officially aims for his third period, but in practice he has influenced the country's leadership since 1994.
Then the rebel group, the RPF, ended the genocide organized by extremists.
Kagame was commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized, among other things, for the crushing of opposition and for restricting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of, for example, distortions of poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to pursue, as the Constitution of the Presidentship has been amended for two periods.
However, in Rwanda, Kagame is also a true leader.
During his time, there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investment has been influencing the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in combining the country of genocide.
The success of Ruanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multiparty democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, Kagame also promised his people more freedom after the land has been raised on his feet.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights false news by improving the control of facts
Facebook intends to send possible false news to more and more independent fact inspectors and to present the results under the original article. The world’s largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published on its website an opinion that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Possible false news will be sent to fact inspectors and results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for the fact that it is the biggest distributor of fake news. Many believe that false news influenced the results of the US presidential elections in 2016.
The topic has risen to a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombed with false news before the May Presidential election and Germany, preparing for September elections, supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate opinion published in Germany that the facts are being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see what stories do not pass the screen of independent inspectors. They also want more background information to be able to decide more illustratively what they read and distribute,” wrote Facebook’s news feed product manager Sara Su in the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the related articles and make other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
The story of a castle
The small town of Scotney in the Kent county is now known as Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hidden location in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of storm history behind it. Now this charming place in the river valley of Bewl is a subject to a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old-fashioned moppi-hair writer.
“It’s great to be able to study the text written by a dead person over 300 years ago,” Rhodes said.
"I know a personal connection when I keep a letter in my hand."
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edvardian Time. Each story has been illustrated by a different artist, a promising British comicist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on the archives of Rhodes. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories appeared from him, whose sources of inspiration were the documents of the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I moved to tears in my letter with a thumb track. The letter had been written by a double agent working for divisions in the 17th century," Rhodes said.
“It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke because the lighting used fire at that time.
Three centuries later, the reader feels that he is on the spot himself.
I love archives!"
The author who was encouraged in old documents was able to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of Arts of England, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he couldn’t sit in the castle for a little longer than he had expected.
He spent days exploring the viktorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rares, such as wall hanged hyena heads and hundreds of bottles in the vallihauda.
He roamed the old castle with ruins and tiles and discussed with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who photograph the book.
I'd like to say, "I took whiskey and started writing."
Scotney’s closer history is quite unknown, since the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heritage Elizabeth Hussey in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff was just starting to visit the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking all the extra amounts to the entrance.
There were journals in the archives, letters from the time of the English Empire and maps about who owned anything. "You could imagine that the country disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "This is where the families fought for even one hard.
It reminded me that it shouldn't be."
Some of the stories of the book are moving from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It tells about a man who soon after the castle was completed in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex book mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes said.
“The British housewife rebel began in the same area, and it reminded me that the rebel can begin with riot.
Maybe these events are connected to each other?”
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, the story of the priest Darrellin’s family hidden seven years during the purification of faith in England.
The Smuggler again tells smuggler Arthur Darrell's story in the 17th century. He said he framed his own funeral with a coffin filled with stones (that was observed years later when his grave was opened).
Darrellit is the favorite family of Rhodes in Scotney. "Perhee's men seem to have been quite blurred. They were constantly in debt and bought things they wouldn't have afforded.
“The men of Darrell’s family solved their debt problem by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who were able to alleviate the heritage.”
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book of Life, a parable in the beginning of the 19th century, which has been left only a rehabilitated land.
Scotney Castle has a special place in her heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he says.
“I didn’t want to go back to this devil’s ark yet.”
The worst in Russia then in the cold war
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukraine conflict.
I believe that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been after the end of the cold war, Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the cold war, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, especially after the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and due to the continuous instability caused by Russia in the Eastern Ukraine region, NATO’s relationship with Russia has significantly deteriorated.
According to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to doing so that tensions do not increase.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the exaggeration of the situation and the new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, President Donald Trump was able to find that between the United States and Russia was even at a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged us to congratulate the poor congress of the countries that adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko stops a re-treatment match against Anthony Joshua will not be done
The long-term World Championship Vladimir Klitshko will end his career.
Ukrainen Klitshko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
Atlanta’s Olympics in 1996, Klitshko fought as a professional for 69 times, winning 64 of the matches.
He held various MM notes in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his career for the last two matches.
Tyson Fury hit him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko met at Wembley Stadium and lost Anthony Joshua after a brutal match in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find motivation for the match.
I was deliberately using a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley match, Klitshko told me when he told me.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I got everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after a sport.
I could never have imagined that I had such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitshko’s reasoning on the video.
Klitshko’s manager Bernd Bönte told Klitshko that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he doesn’t have enough motivation anymore.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating the American actress Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, born in 2014, daughter Kaya.
Clitshko’s grand brother Vitali is also the former World Champion of the heavy series.
In 2008-12, the brothers managed the MM notes of different associations at the same time.
The Finnish weather breaker is subject to the conditions: "Vie from the Fiil"
Minna Nikkanen has suffered the conditions during the summer's external iron season.
Minna Nikas has had problems with circumstances.
Wind and cold have taken from a woman.
There are also unstable conditions in the London World War II.
Minna Nikkanen talks about weather.
This summer, the circumstances have been a slope jump against Minna Nikka.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I didn't even get the little slots to move properly, Nicanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've been competing and practicing here knowing how many times and never experienced one different wind in this place, Nicanen told me in Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this period, it has been very difficult to standardize the jump, even when there are so unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen said in the Kaleva races.
The weather spoke on Thursday in London.
It's been quite challenging to get the technology together, whether it's a cold bucket or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken away from the fil.
It makes no sense to consume energy in a bad situation.
Thanks to the 455, he got to the MM.
There's been 445 out there.
The relationship is not the same for everyone in London.
You have to be calm and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 on Friday.
Why don't you go out to work abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump and technology standardized.
I guess I should have done the same now.
Normally, he's been able to practice, and now he's closed.
What would it be wonderful to compete?
25 degrees warm.
It's a small wind, as long as it's standard.
Experienced ex-published politicians at the top: "We have no dividends now or for many years."
Despite the positive climate of the economy, the government of Juha Sipila must keep ice in the hat and warn the state budget with debt money, warns the budgets prepared by Erkki Virtanen in the Ministry of Finance for decades.
He said there's no distribution.
Yle interviewed Virta in mid-week One in 2015.
The construction of the next year's budget is just beginning.
Recently, the proposals of politicians on the increase of the pension, the reduction of car tax and the support of electric bicycles are regarded as electoral speeches.
They mainly tell us that elections are starting to be close, because when ten percent of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we do not have any share now or for many years.
I think it's even a betrayal to talk about sharing when you're taking debt, Virtanen said to Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debts were owed to children.
Virtas has a long experience in preparing the state budgets: he started in 1978 as a budget secretary and then worked as a Deputy Head of Budget Department and Head of Budget.
Last time he retired, he served as the head of the Ministry of Labour and Industry.
Virtanen pointed out in the interview with Yle that the expected 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a pigeon from which we are going to go to a subviis next year, and Finland is expected to grow by one percent for tens of years.
Washington changes the rules of permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the Green Card rules of residence will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal migrants to 50,000 per year, to tighten the requirements of temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of the Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
The new search process benefits applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have the skills that are beneficial to our economy,” Trump said.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried in the same place with the Queen
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareeta.
In the picture Prince Henrik and Queen Margareeta described in April.
The Danish queen Margareeta, 77, and this married prince Henrik, 83, is not buried next to the Danish court.
Traditionally, dominant couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's room today has announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Church of Roskilde, the court notes when he announced Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, this is the reason for the unhappyness of the Prince in his role in the royal family.
There is no secret that the prince has been unsatisfactory in his role and title in the Danish monarchy, Lene Belleby commented in the newspaper.
The prince’s decision that he is not buried next to the queen is a natural consequence that he is not treated as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of the desire for his spouse’s funeral and understands the decision.
The horror on the road: The car was coming on the motorway
Tomm had an open-minded wife and two little children on his ride.
They were not injured in an accident, but they will not receive money from insurance if the other party is not targeted.
Turma happened at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Architecture of the construction of the Body III.
Vantalainen Tommi says his family survived on Tuesday at a miracle store in a car accident.
Tommi, his open-minded partner, Riina and two small couples, drove on the motorway at Keimolanport in Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
By joining the Hämeenlinnan tour III, it was a white car that was driving to the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without an ambulance, the car would have come to Tom.
I brake and turned the car at the same time, and it left the hands, Tommi says.
The family's car crashed at a high speed of track.
The parents and two little children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is a little less than 3 years old, one less than a year old.
I guess it was pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one passed us even though there was a busy traffic in the place.
The accident took place around 17.20.
In fact, no one stopped with them, and the family called the Emergency Center.
They got out of the car with their own strength.
The staff of the ambulance and the rescue department arrived and the family was checked.
The car went back to redemption.
Tommi tells him that he and his family have small revenues, and they received a family contribution to buying a car a couple of years ago.
Without information from another car, the family does not receive any money from the insurance.
Therefore, the family hopes for witnesses to see the car that led the family to the highway.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take children to the garden and work without it, Tom says.
Tommi saw the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
He thought the start of the car's registration number was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don't know how we manage financially, we still have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that you have seen or know something about it is connected to the police.
The Eastern Newland Police and the Central Newland Rescue Authority confirm that they have had a mission at the accident site on Tuesday night.
The title and the case was corrected at 21.15: Unlike the case originally said, the second car did not come to the nearest lane, but it was to drive from the acceleration band to the car of the family.
The Lotta Member's guided presentation deals with human relationships by humor means - The Self-Player will be seen in What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lota Jäppinen from Kouvola brings his first-families to the Theatre What?
Self-discoverer is a musical theatre from past relationships and inadequateness.
The director Lotta Jäppise said it would still be a good idea.
The topic is discussed by humor means.
The old feelings aren't in debt, he says.
The circular summer theatre is carried out with a long-lived budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the show challenges considering what a person reveals himself when he meets a new person.
Do you think he's going to play a role or approach another jacket open?
The inconvenience of the presentation mixes the fact and the fiktion
Jappinen has both directed and dramatized the show.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of texts of the working group and does not have a plot.
The director believes that even though the show distracts young people’s thoughts, it talks about all ages.
Jäppinen stresses that the self-discoverer does not directly tell about his own or working group’s human relationships.
Factory and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my world of value will care about the show.
I don’t think human relationships are bad, but I don’t think human relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jappinen believes that a self-discoverer draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland a century.
According to him, many have learned a lot of relationships from their parents, many of whom have separated.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The show shows Minea Lång, Niklas Rautan and Otto Rokka.
The team also includes a costume Ella Snellman.
Music is the match of the Jäppinen and Rokan.
Love in the theater was lighted in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola, 26, studys as a director of the theatre’s expression at the Academy of Arts of Turku University of Applied Sciences.
There's two years behind, and there's another mokoma.
A member’s enthusiasm to the theater has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The educator of music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has been presenting, among other things, at the University of Helsinki and the last Castle Theatre in Turku.
Leadership has started to be more and more interested.
The self-discoverer received his first night last week in Helsinki at the Narr scene.
A 45-minute presentation was also seen in the future at least in the study city of the Member in Turku.
Self-discoverer Kouvolan What? Theatre at 4.8 at 19 and 5.8 p.m. at 14 and 19.
The Finnish Olympic Winner recovered for a year from the terrible motocrosson accident - the kaularanka broke
Hard athletes in Finland are similar to unstoppable natural power as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of cucumber counts circulated the world for hundreds of days a year for decades and hunted for its dream of the Olympic Gold.
The dream was implemented in 2002, but the movement of Lahtela continued.
He was not only a tired trainer, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that the chemical lake would not have tried at least once.
It's been excited to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela says.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela was in a motocross accident.
As a result, his necklace and both hands broke.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I licked wounds at home for a year, Lahtela says.
The gift was bad luck.
He also admits that his age could have been part of the ruin.
Driving a bike can sound terrible.
But I didn't get the limits.
It is just so hard as a species that a 40-year-old is not worth doing too much!
After the accident, the Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long rush behind the Japanese freestyle team as the main coach of the team.
Lahtela started in the pest immediately after his career was completed in 2006.
For the first time after I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do anything, Lahtela tells me.
During the training period, Lahtela often challenged his protector in the slope and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally tired so that my thoughts didn’t seem rational.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be there.
I really enjoyed it because I was once really able to be.
The forced break enthusiasted Lahtela as the main coach in Finland.
Without stopping, he fears that he would have burned out.
It’s easier to find places that have gone apart than healthy!
Without an accident, I would not have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started the Finnish freestyle team as a coach about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby in place.
I changed the motocross to frisbeegolph!
That's what got out of the lap right now.
The worst of all, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-inspired trainer, he does not require his trainers to be the same as he.
I don't force everyone to be the same.
In our race culture, there is room for us to be one of our own and ways to become the best of the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been consistent with it, Lahtela says.
Sex Robots are coming and we need to be worried.
It is here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robot industry – just when it started to feel that the year 2017 can no longer become stranger.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within 5-10 years.
“We need to start taking a serious view of the generalisation of sex robots,” says the founding member of the Foundation and the emerald professor Noel Sharky Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of finger nails.
"The sex robots are sniffed, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them," Sharky said in publicity.
Sexy puppets have developed from blowing dolls to robots with the warmest silicone skin as well as the features created by artificial intelligence that resemble the use of human beings.
The user can also adapt the robot to its own preferences always from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
The more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like advanced liberation fighters.
Sexy puppets have developed into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the nature of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, such as shy.
True Companion Roxxxy Gold robots have pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality is as perfect as possible to the user's personality," the company's website is advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It may be tired, in the mood or in the mood.
There are many worrying features in the generalization of sex robots. They replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subduing of women and direct rape fantasy when the user approaches, for example, a shy and resistively programmed robot.
True Companion compares Roxxy robot with vibrator:
"Women has a vibrator, why should men have a sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalisation and development tells us about some darker and deeper culture: the recession of gender equality towards sexual intercourses, where subduing is one of the options among others.
Of course, most men do not have sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, Marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many begin to be weird or offensive only when the market permits it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to spread at the same time as women's rights are threatened across the world and the White House sits in a president who has praised women to be distressed.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattare) is not the most alarming of its powerful image language, such as pictures of the hanged body and out of the mined eyes. The most disturbing is how the world feels realistic.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robots are attempted to make as much like real women (with the dimensions of pornstars) as technically possible.
Robots developers want their skin to feel real and movements to imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot cannot leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will and history — nothing imposing independence or breaking the fantasy of complete surrender.
They are pleasant servants.
Slavery.
Police suspected: two terrorist attacks were planned to Australia, the group was headed by Isis' chief
The CEO of Isis led a group of Australian men who was suspected of taking a bomb into an airplane of Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person in the lead figures of Isis had also sent the building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to suspects, the bomb was intended to be taken to the aircraft on July 15, but the company was suspended before the security check was carried out.
The police don't tell me why the company's interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colourless gas extraction device and to bring the device to a full public place, such as public transportation.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police racials on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews are also continued.
Trump's good side?
Get Mitt Romney to show a healthy mind in the root
Trump’s period has been repeated to the age of boring that the strong electoral tribute has also broken families at everyday level.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers’ advisory workshops guided how Trumpia voted relatives can be met.
We all want to clear our information bubbles.
Trump’s ability to unite families has remained less attention.
I'll tell you about this because my cousin visited me this week in New York, and he's a left-looking poet in Chicago, who has long been the opposite of our family with Republicans.
He reminded me that a common enemy could have a strong combined effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousins, including a sister who supports Republicans, with whom he has disputed politics for decades, are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but, more widely, there are significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new flow, but the distortive effect of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we are talking about the scary possibility that one day we can no longer bear to horror his tricks.
In the long run, there is even more terrifying possibility that Trump normalizes the Republicans of the right extremity, which suddenly seem rational compared to Trump.
I remember as a slight version of the madness of Mitt Romney: the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (and at least his tax declarations have been seen).
When Trump's season is over, the next presidential candidate of the Republicans has to be clear and feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our child to the Central Park Caruselli, which is the largest carusel in the New York Park department and the best thing to get in New York with three dollars without caffeine.
The horses of Karuselli are huge, the characters in the middle – the causal clowns and the animals behind the horror – are evil, and the music behind the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of the features of New York are disappointed over time: the prospects of high buildings are getting bored, the city’s siluette becomes too familiar and the city’s reality does not match dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I have not fully overcome the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a large transport circle in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-kind pub, but it is not counted.
On the other hand, the carousel of the central park is still a strange magical experience – even to the extent that two two two-year-olds, one-one-year-old and two-four-old women enjoy it hugely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked me for my assessment, but fortunately, no one came to ask.
Instead, this week, I was asked to evaluate my "pay experience" at a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on a reader.
The same thing in the cafe at my home, but there is also the opportunity for me to combine the 15% service money when I go to the coffee dish.
This slows down the daily interaction and pressures the customer server to put their personality into the game in a situation where it is not necessary.
The vendor of the store smiled as a pity when I gave my credit card five stars to the experience of use.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Interi - "There was no trust in leadership"
FC Inter has released Shefki Kuq’s team from the coach’s duties today.
The training responsibility is taken as an assistant coach of Fabrizio Piccare.
The other training team will continue in its current tasks.
Italian Piccareta has previously been an assistant coach in English Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the interior training group, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Mr Stefan Håkans, President of the Interior Board of FC.
The exchange of coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had any trust in the management of the Society, when there was no other choice, Håkans commented on the company’s communication.
The Piccareta Agreement shall apply until the end of the period.
He is already responsible for tomorrow's home fight against HIFK.
According to the records from the afternoon, the team has gone down on Thursdays.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the company's assistant coachs Piccarea and John Allen have been moved away.
Kuqi and Piccareta strongly joined Inter in the game against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius released a picture of youth in the 80s, would you recognize a serious violin student?
Linda Lampenius, a violinist, released a young picture in Instagram.
There are a number of chaos to the picture, which can suggest that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders about a young woman watching the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he's communicating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also spoke of painful topics.
A year ago, he released a picture pair of himself in Instagram.
In the second picture, he will be seen 20 years ago, in the second he will pose now, as a mother of two children.
In his photographic text, Lampenius reflects its own growth as a man and refers to eating disorders that he suffers when he is younger.
20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot the same as that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text, he had added a funny life in English, eating disorder, uncertainty, self-confidence, self-confidence, love yourself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about the eating raspberries of the past years.
He was in the hospital at the age of 14 for anorexia and orthoxy.
A little later, he also got sick of his bulim, which eventually appeared only in 2006.
Improvement began a little bit.
In addition to therapy and comparison, Lampenius helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital due to breast pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was treated with hospital care in his shores, according to the prison authorities, when he fell in the cell.
Pistorius was sentenced to the murder of the prosecutors' appeal for the original murder sentence.
He killed Steenkampi in early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have said they are going to complain again because they consider Pistorius's six-year sentence too mild.
The royal prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the complaint may be dealt with already this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may be extended for 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, announced by the Foreign Ministry of the country’s BTV channel.
The police arrested a group of unauthorized campers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, two Bulgarians among the camps.
They were released on the same day, but the case continues.
According to BTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that the Bulgarians were released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping areas and already provide significant fines for all those who are camping in non-purpose areas.
The checks will continue until the end of the period.
The minister announced that the right to impose fines may be imposed.
Net shares are flooding - fallen already -7.7%
The oil-processing Nesteen share has fallen by 7.7 per cent around 11:00 p.m.
Its result before the taxes fell, but exceeded the prediction of Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange has launched a slightly packed side of both Finland and elsewhere in Europe today.
Shortly after the opening of the stock exchanges, a large European Stoxx 600 index had declined by 0.2%.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after half-hour trading and OMXH25 had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which nine million were the results published in the morning.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may alleviate irritated bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmares of the digestive system.
However, a recent study argues the opposite: a rich diet containing meat protein and milk products may facilitate an irritated bowel syndrome.
An irritated bowel syndrome is an un healed disease that suffers about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at Washington University found that the necessary amino acid triptophane contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the susceptibility of the bowel.
According to the research director Marco Colonna, immunocells guarded the salt and ensure that foods do not contain harmful microbies.
Inflammatory cells balance cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result may be an irritated bowel syndrome.
The tests found that immunocells that strengthen tolerance are present in mice with a specific bacteria in the intestine.
This bacteria needs tryptophane in order to start developing immunocells. Tryptophane is one of the building materials of proteins.
"We found a connection between the development of the Lactobacillus reuter bacterial and the cell that promotes susceptibility. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal microbiome of the intestine," Professor Colonna said.
"The more the mouse diet was triptophane, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuter bacteria and a diet containing a high triptophane can strengthen the susceptibility of the intestinal and reduce the sensitivity of the inflammation.
When investigating immunocells that enhanced tolerability, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one mouse group had such cells, they were not in the same mice that were separated from another group.
He suspected that the difference was associated with the intestinal microbials, i.e. the normal gastrointestinal bacteria, seeds and viruses in the community.
When the intestinal DNA was studied, six bacteria were observed in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuter bacteria were given to mice grown in a sterile environment with no intestinal microbiome and no immunocells developed, they began to develop immunocells.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria influenced the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in the liquid and moved small amounts of fluids – without bacteria – to immature immune cells isolated from the mouse.
Immune cells developed into tolerable cells.
When the active ingredients were cleaned from the fluid, it proved to be a side product of the metabolism of tryptophane known as indol-3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptophan in the nutrition of mice, the number of susceptibility cells increased by about 50%. When the number of triptophan was pooled, the number of cells fell by half of the previous.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, man has the same tolerance cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether Triptophan’s side products from Lactobacillus reuter bacteria can develop cells in humans in the same way as in mice. However, trüptophane-related genetic errors have been observed in patients with an exciting bowel syndrome.
“We must want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate the inflammation of the intestinal surfaces of the intestines,” Cervantes-Barragan says.
"The high level of tryptophane combined with the Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their generalization."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United received a "neron" agreement with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United was awarded a "neron" agreement with Nemanja Matic. The central field player debytoed the Manchester United rows against Sampdoria on Wednesday nights.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea at 40 million pounds, started at 2-1 wins in Dublin, United's last match before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressed as a defending middle field player against the stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not yet in the best condition, because he was not involved in the Asian tour of blue shirts before the beginning of the season. He survived the field for only 45 minutes – Mourinho said that it would have to change before the beginning of the valioliga season.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking makes him a genius – he has a natural football thinking ability,” Mourinho says.
“We will help him to be ready rather than later.”
In addition to Matic, the visitors Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game with Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to cut his initial meeting for the beginning of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three new players, even though the club has already done a “great job” by getting three of his four priority players.
“Three out of four – it must be given thanks to the company,” he added.
“I am more pleased if I get all four, but they did great work.”
Flyball women tempted Germany for two rounds.
The Finnish Women's Flyball Team lost its fourth match for Germany directly 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German routine level of playing is high.
Their game was in every sector, the main coach of Finland, Tapio Kangasniemi, told the newsletter.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept his opponent at a stack, but in the third round, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to go with them, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was 14 points collected by Piia Korhonen.
Three matches of four lost Finland will meet Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The Great Jury has already sent challenges regarding Trump Jr's Russian meeting
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges in relation to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and the Russian advocacy and Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The great jury summoned by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and the Russian advocate Natalia Veselnitskaya, known as Donald Trump Jr and Kreml.
The news agency Reuters, who, at the same time, confirms the information previously published by Wall Street Journal on Thursday on the summoning of a large jury.
According to Reuters, the large jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Trump Jr and Kreml, known for Veselnitskaya, held in June 2016 at the U.S. presidential elections.
There were also Donald Trump Sr’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, current counselor, Jared Kushner of the White House.
According to the sources of Reuters, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has called together a great jury in Washington means the consolidation of the Russian investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted to help a large jury in the investigation, which aims to determine Russia's interference with the US presidential election and whether Trump's campaign or his neighbourhood collaborated with Russia.
The great jury expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges and forces people to declare oath.
The large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The large jury will consider the evidence investigated by the prosecutor and decide whether the charges should be filed.
The British inventor microcircled himself to get to his home and to his car with hand swinging
The British inventor is the first to microchip himself in the whole country so that he can open his home to the outside door, get to his office and start his car with a swing.
The microchip is between a 33-year-old Steven Northam thumb and a front finger. Now he offers services to companies and individuals who want to make their life easier with Northam BioTeq technology.
Northam collaborates with a doctor at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester in Hants, Geoff Watson, who consults the hospital of the Royal Hampshire in order to meet the medical requirements for the installation of the microchip.
The microchip uses the same technique as the cats and dogs microchips, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also makes houses and car locks compatible with the microchip. One lock processing costs 300 £.
Northam is married, and he has one child. He has placed a microchip technology in his home and BMW Z4 car that starts when he drops his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibition cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The final decision of the White House to fly the marine helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House to show American production was to pay taxpayers $24,000.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president was on board. It was a drawback at the event held in the White House on 17.7.2017, which presented American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials were familiar with products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter produced in Connecticut, the samples included a sailing boat from Maine, a fire car from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House's Military Office had asked the helicopter to be in position only about 36 hours before landing on the southern grassroot event. This is reflected in the documents of the HMX-1 helicopter ferry.
"I just wanted to ensure that you were aware of the matter because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote on the day before the event in an e-mail message to his supervisor, an assistant commander of the Navy Flight.
The message told me that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at 7 a.m. on 17 July, and the event would begin at 3 afternoons. The helicopter would only leave the place after the helicopter was emptyed in the evening between six and nine.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the helicopter was delayed from the White House, there would be a need for a second crew due to restrictions on service times.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security staff was at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The documents received by the TIME magazine are not clear whether there was a need for another crew.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired, a violation of the law.
“One of our questions was whether the Hatch Act was violated, and we were told not to be violated,” the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the Deputy Commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even the official events have political tones.
At that time, the President spoke on behalf of the health reform in the process of the Senate and the poorer state regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their journeys,
But their use only for photos is unusual.
Trump’s actions took note in February when Air Force One rolled on the background of the president’s campaign event in Melbourne in Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor’s presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The white house is very pleased with the Made in America event, which introduced products from American workers' American materials from all 50 states," said Lindsay Walters, the White House press secretary.
The HMX-1 crew regularly carry out training flights in the Washington area and practice in the southern field to bring the president to the White House with accuracy of centimeters.
When Trump was at the G-20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 countings for the White House.
According to one official, the flights to the Made in America were included in the monthly training quota of the crew.
The unit’s helicopters were also flying on that day for 11 hours in non-presidency support tasks.
According to the White House, the event did not cost taxpayers any other costs.
Sikorsky’s reporter said that the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter presentation in the southern field of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have records of flights related to the president’s duties, and it is difficult to accurately assess the costs of the event.
According to the 2017 Defense Ministry of Defense, the level of compensation for VH-3D helicopter is 24,380 dollars per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from Quantico to Virginia to the White House and back lasted an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of using a helicopter is clearly lower.
"The calculation of the costs for taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The required level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called ‘integrated costs’, which are taken into account in annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 Survey of the RAND Research Company, the level of compensation does not include staff costs, but takes into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
During the event, former secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
“I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of them to ensure national security and to employ hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defense supplies, for which many Americans have worked hard.
It’s absolutely appropriate to bring it up.”
It is not sure if Trump went to the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat on the fire car driver.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky ferry.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."

The Venezuela State Prosecutor demands the right to prevent the appointment of a new country representative
The Venezuela State Prosecutor has applied for a court decision that would prevent the appointment of a new country representative.
President Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela, has announced that the delegation elected in the last Sunday vote is to be appointed on Friday.
In the controversial vote, the country was elected a representative office, which could, among other things, change the Constitution of the country.
According to prime prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the decision to prevent is requested because of the election doubts.
Ortega has also started a election investigation.
He appointed two judges to the task after the British company that organised a representative vote said that the results were manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuela authorities was about a million higher than the number of voters.
Only allies of Maduro were subject to the membership of the representativeship, and the selected 555 members include Maduro’s son and wife.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the delegation may disrupt the opposition-led congress and amend the laws.
Maduroa is described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the amendment of the Constitution as a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
In turn, the European Union, the UK, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they do not recognise the new delegation.
Maduro claims that the new delegation is a solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, the restorations have continued for months.
Many people have been wounded and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela fell to the economic crisis by falling the price of oil.
Now, many people cannot afford food or drugs.
The opposition is also expected to point out the opinion on Friday, when the new delegation is to begin.
The Russian man released by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the court of Minneapolis condemned the 41-year-old Maksim Senah for almost four years of imprisonment of the involvement of the global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the demand made by the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
Finland gave it to the US judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, the news agency said AFP.
In March this year, he was found guilty of a computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah had 46 months of imprisonment.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be expelled from the country after the execution of the imprisonment.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs blamed Finland hardly after the arrest and said that the man should not be surrendered to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused of being arrested in Finland without Russia’s knowledge of it in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that grabbed tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to fish for user names and passwords.
After that, fraudulents used the information by further directing the internet traffic to make clip scams and spread the spam.
According to the Department of Justice, Kenneth Blanco, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt other cyber criminals.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told me in the newsletter.
Modified at 20.58: Repaired the name of the convicted person.

Two men fought in the shopping center parking hall in Espoo
Two men had a dispute in Espoo in the shopping centre of Iso Omena Parking Hall on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute began when the other party accidentally drove into a prohibited direction.
There was an oral dispute between drivers.
A driver in a prohibited driving direction would sweep the driver of another car, and as a result, this car went on the move by hitting the hitter's car.
After that, he hit the crashed car in the machine.
In the initial talk, the man admitted that he had caused damage and had done wrong.
Timo Soin's question mark titled: "Then there was a flood."
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (v.) published a blog on Thursday, titled on the question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences.
During my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven representatives of the government.
Then came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The text of Soin has references to France in the 17th century.
King Ludvig XV or his lover Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the water flood comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, the books of history have left the records of “the flood after us” or “the flood after me.”
According to the United Nations, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections are only representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the Head of the UN Afghanistan Mission on Wednesday.
The temporary leader of the UN Assistance Mission Nicholas Haysom said that there are hundreds of women in the elections of the county councils, three women are seeking to become Vice-President and more than 30% of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be underlined too much," Haysom said in his opinion on Wednesday.
Elections can be genuinely representative and credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghanistan Council and Presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made threats to elections at the same time as international troops are moving to a consultative role.
This year’s elections are the first time when the power moves peacefully from a democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contribution will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent electoral committee in Afghanistan, 1.2 million voters of 3.6 million are women.

Flooding of certain tourists is a threat to the culture of the region
The authorities consider limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
In particular, local rage targets the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian cultural minister calls it "eat and flee" tourism: there are only a few hours in place and we are going to run through attractions in large troops.
Venezuelans have been suppressed by fast day trips to the city’s tourists.
On the narrow streets, it is difficult to move and fine squares are so full of visitors that the Venice residents are no longer able to fit in.
They have been forced to move even further from the historical center, while homes have been replaced by hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
The authorities consider restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the present phenomenon a low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, the time will be given for two or three hours.
You follow the ticket guide from Piazzale Romalta to the Rialton Bridge and the St. Mark, and turn back, describes Italian cultural minister Dario Franceschini’s dominant and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We need to keep this part of the city's identity.
The Holy Markus Tour is also one of the most popular visits to the Venice Historic Centre.
The Church of Saint Markus is located on the side of Tori.
Also, local anger is mostly targeted by cruise ships.
In the historic centre of Venice there are only 50,000 locals.
In 1951, there were about 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, 2,000 Venetians expressed their minds against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives people away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years, there are no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe.
The equation is difficult for ships to bring to Venice the income they need and create the need for numerous different areas of workplaces.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution has been made for cruisers to go beyond the historical center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, thinks that the situation would certainly change if Veneto's administrative area, where Venice is located, would have more power to decide on his own matters, unless it is complete with autonomy.
There are about 20-30 million tourists every year in Venice.
Are you driving in Kuopio?
Motorway bad kilometers of congestion
The road between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi on the road to the north has been congested from Thursday afternoon work at the time of the return traffic of kilometres.
In the area, road coating work is done, which slows traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For sciences, 50 kilometers of hour speed is a limit instead of a normal 120 kilometer hour speed.
Even in the 50 kilometres limiting area, the traffic had evolved on Thursday afternoons in places, however, in practice.
The roadwork progressed on Thursday afternoon on the side of the Silicon Lake at the scene of Revelation, namely the golden horror.
I'll be fine without that attention.
A 23-year-old runner had to notice the curses of the public.
Amalie Iuel has published great pictures of himself, including in the Grand Canyon landscape.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-northian, has become a popular athlete in his current country in Norway, not least because he broke a record of 26 years old in March at a 400 metre run by circumventing the Railway Round at 51.81.
A month later, he improved 400 metres of fence during the Norwegian record 55.38.
Iuel, who used the social media, soon after his records, found that he had his shadow in the celebrity and publicity.
Men all over the world began to send pictures of their sex organs to Iuel in the hope that a young runner was interested in them.
Iuelin had to close his Snapchat account from outside.
I got a lot of "breaking images" from unknown people, so I had to make my account private, Iuel told the VG.
Iuel did not want to accurately identify what kind of images he had in the VG interview.
You can guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'm going to get along well without such a different kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Danish, a Danish-norgy father.
Iuel’s family moved to Norway when she was two years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia first because of his job, then Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in turn.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains three coachs, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
There is much more open discussion in Norway than in the United States.
In the United States, coachs don’t ask anything, they only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to be personally involved with the athlete, Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel keeps records of Norway at 400 meters and 400 meters in the fence run.
Footjob took the snowboarder Janne Korve to the whole career of the scale - now joined the MM races: "Well, it doesn't hurt anything."
It's been nice to count when it hasn't happened to anything!
Janne Korpi, 31, read the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has been able to really enjoy their loved species this season.
Last summer, the success of the career was at stake.
The weight injury of the leg table had forced the Korve to the cutting table in January, and the foot did not want any healing.
The hand had taken a hit in the race.
In summer, I didn’t know what I was doing, whether the boarding continued or not.
Sponsorides were broken and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, things happen.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull back into the chest.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew it at the latest when I first went to snow.
I was damned, but it's so fun, it's still pulling through a couple of more.
The corpse was able to count properly only in September-October, but after a long break, just a painless exercise has been a big deal.
Only a few of them have been rounded by the Corp.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of the ferry.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to target four years in one race, and then you're in fever for the week.
I can't think that, Corpi says.
Today, the Korpi competes in the half-pipe of the MM competitions held in Sierra Nevada.
Even though the individual races do not like him in the board, in a hard company, he always lights.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the races organised by the International Skiing Association has increased over the last few years, although some of the boarders chose to hold Norway X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is large.
However, I think that appreciation always depends on what conditions and the level of competitions are.
The Corp is the oldest athlete in the 12-year-old team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's holes, the 17-year-olds Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger.
It's nice to follow younger friends.
I remember when I was at the time that everything was new and so sickly excited about everything.
It brings a new flow to itself, Corpi thinks.
I'm still on my chest, but otherwise I don't, that's the amount of friends are flowing!
Janne Korpi has also built a different sports career.
Pekka Korve's son has been engaged in the sport: the ferryer has his own health horses to whom he performs training programs.
When I'm traveling all the time, there's no time to be in the mess.
But I look at at least the diet results every day, and usually something about departures, Korpi says.
Nutrition and therapeutic training are a potential career plan, according to Korve, when the boarding career is completed.
I'm not planning so far, but it's at least a probable alternative.
I'm going to feel like a little more than I'm studying it here along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to stay nervous and develop in the summer to drive some kind of departures.
If it’s my future profession, then it’s not difficult to start when it’s already within the species.
The restaurants also include an Elitloppet restaurant with Jaajo Linnoma.
The twin has rented a cruise ship, which will head to the Stockholm Elitloppet restaurant competition at the end of May.
The Corps and the Birdland decided to revive the old tradition into life.
Crossing has become a good deal, and people have been excited.
We're already at the point that we're not going to bankrupt at least.
There are a few months left, hopefully the ship will be filled, Korpi says he is excited.
The Attendo Care Care Project for Kite has surprised everything
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new, 41-story care home for Kite.
The building of 1,700 floor bodies will be completed next summer on the other side of the neighborhood of health centre.
The main issue of a general wonder is where the new treatment unit is enough for customers, as many private homes in the wars of Siu now pose a lack of customer.
Anne Flink Attendo, regional director of care services, commented that in the future, Kite will have more demand not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, the freedom of choice also works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo purchased private care homes from Kitea from Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The trade was involved in business, but a five-year rental contract for real estates is known.
Flink says Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations away from these premises.
More about this later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's Brand in Scotland
The trade union will request the leaders of McVitie's cookie manufacturer to confirm the long-term commitment to production at Glasgow's factory.
According to the General Professional Union GMB Department of Scotland, the company has not reported its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
The factory producing Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products has over 500 employees.
The McVitie's brand-owned Pladis company said he invested in the factory in the last few years more than five million pounds.
The company added that the employees and representatives of the union will be “maintended as the first” if changes are going to be made.
In a letter to the CEO, GMB calls on the company to “receive the concern that no funding has been provided for the modernisation of production lines”.
Drew Duffy, Drew Duffy, the GMB Professional Union, considers it extremely worrying that the factory manager cannot learn about the business needs of Tollcross and future investment plans.
"Perheet has worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has been strongly focused on the local community and the Glasgow’s capital area. The factory is a significant employee in the area of high unemployment and poor livelihood.
From the point of view of workplaces, wages and earnings, and Brexit, rising living costs and continually reducing production, Glasgow needs a successful McVitie's production.”
According to the Pladis informant, the CEO had received a letter of professional union only on the previous day and the company directly responds to the letter because it values the continuous interaction with employees and representatives of the union.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed several issues openly.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and uncertain companies on the market, we are constantly assessing all our business and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness.”
In recent years, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross factory, in particular in its production lines and in improving its operations.
“We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production plant and we will certainly tell the first employees and representatives of the union if we are going to make changes to the factory’s operations.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret its interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up on Neymar's request after paying a transfer of £ 189 million. But did PSG warn Barcelona about a record transfer three years ago?
The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world record of transfers. The previous record was less than half smaller: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him more than 500 000 £ per week after tax.
Barcelona is known to be mad at the PSG's activities and the way Neymar has left the community. The source near Barcelona tells us that Neymar has taken very good care of the company since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the President of the PSG warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that she was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best players for seurations.
“I’m not worried, because they know that if they want our players, we become their opponent and contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the sergeants.
But if they want our players, they will have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: it expressed its interest in the PSG’s middle field player Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not let the Italian leave in any circumstances, and it might well be that Barcelona loses its star player Neymar.

The calls from Trump were invented by the White House reporter: "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by President Donald Trump never happened, says New York Times.
The calls that Trump smoked with both the president of Mexico and the Head of the Scout Organization have proven to be invented.
The White House reporter Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many patrol leaders personally spoke to Trump, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto Trump had discussed at the Hamburg G20 meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty hard accusation.
Those discussions happened, they were not just on the phone, but on the face, Sanders justified.
The speech to the Scouts revived evil
Trump said on Monday, the Mexican president called him and praised Trump’s success in extinguishing illegal migration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told me that few people will come across the southern border of Mexico, because they know that the trip will be satisfied with the US border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a notice in which it said that this call had not been made.
On Tuesday, Politico published the perfect version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump inspired his speech at a large meeting of the National Scout Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Head of Scouts, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the Department of Scouts informed him that it is not aware of any call from any of its executives to Trump.
According to the newsletter, Michael Surbaugh’s previous statement, director of the organization, in which he had asked Trump to apologize to the Scouts, speaks to himself.
Trump’s speech at the meeting of the Scout Organization aroused a lot of odds as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
He, among other things, inspired the results of the last autumn presidential elections.
