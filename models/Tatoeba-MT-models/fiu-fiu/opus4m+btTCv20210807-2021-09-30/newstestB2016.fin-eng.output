A 9-year-old boy in Tampere was found
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday night.
A report on the disappearance of a boy from West Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and he has no danger of life and health.
The son's father told the afternoon-Sanom in the midnight known that the boy was found.
He's okay, and now we're going to start the exams.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo again - rip the painting difference to Mess
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five paints in the Spanish League on the weekend and continued his factory in the Master League.
The struggle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo on the goal of the Masters League turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the top of the scorer statistics of all time when he shot a visitor in Shahtar Donetski’s network two hits on the offences and one of the game situations.
Ronaldo raised his painting score to 80, when before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess had 77 hits in size.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has combounded in the Italian Football League in Serie A, but in the Mestarite League D block it started strongly with 2-1 guest wins from Manchester City.
The winning painting was done for ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bored the absence of a knee-wise Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend, came to the field only in the last ten minutes.
The second company of Manchester United also experienced hardships in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after 1-2 losses.
Luke Shaw's 20-year-old law enforcement officer ManU's visitor only lasts 15 minutes.
Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking sliding hit the ManU bags that attacked him so bad that Shaw probably broke the leg bone.
Shaw lay on Eindhoven's homestadium lawn for a decade of minutes before the medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests to 1-0 in 41 minutes, but the joy of ManU only lasted a few minutes.
Moreno fixed it before the break at an extra time.
In the second half, the PSV winning painting was made by Luciano Narsingh.
The Masters League of the Earth Planet began the A block of Paris Saint-Germain.
This was replaced by an Argentinian Angel Di Maria, who switched to the PSG of Manchester United shirt.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball in the back corner of Malmo's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made 2-0 for the second half of PSG.
PSG has been betten among the successors of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö is not the best possible benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a PSG starblower, first met his professional career in Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow was lost in the B-party match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately demanded a divorce - the president had the wrong speech.
Zimbabwen President Robert Mugabe had the same speech he had spoken a month ago.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has held the same speech in the House of the country again, which he said at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn’t realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe was 91-year-old in full life.
The main opposition party MDC demanded Mugabe to resign from his mission because it is too old to rule.
Assistants in Mugabe rushed to say that the confusion had happened only in the Mugabe district and that the president had not done anything wrong.
Mugaben's speech was discussed earlier and now on the influence of China on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional EU summit for the next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading to the summits, evaluates the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, government leaders should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
Negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers, according to Merkel, are included in the table of the Ministers of Interior.
Professor admits in an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend
Professor Shannon Lamb, at the emergency call, asked a voice to shake the police at his home and told him he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned, in particular, that their beloved dog was there and alive and probably in fear. The professor said that the contact information of the dead woman’s family would be on the woman’s phone.
Inside the house, the police found a message written by Amy Prentiss's body and a white paper: "I am very sorry and I hope I could cancel my actions. I loved Amy, and he's the only woman who ever loved me," written by Lamb, according to the authorities.
There were no signs in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Mississippi Cleveland, had already traveled 500 kilometers to school campus. The police found a history professor Ethan Schmidt, who was thought to have been shot by Lamb.
Lynn Buford, chief of police at Delta State University, said that the University's office received information about the shooting at 10 a.m.
She said Lamb called the fate emergency call for a while after that.
One more death occurred today, and Lamb killed himself when the police reached him.
In the next day, the students and educational staff kept behind the locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to find out Lamb's motive.
The researchers explored the details in both places, and Lamb’s familiar teachers told me about the man. The researchers were born a picture of a talented but perhaps a problem teacher.
Students always said they were eager to wait for the professor's hours.
According to Prentiss's police officer Gautier, the professor had no previous case of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned Lamb in the book he wrote, where he had confessed to the “green people” with whom he could spend academic life.
Both worked in social sciences and history, the educational staff included 17 people. Many students participated in both men’s courses.
However, there were references to problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers told me that the professor seemed to be aroused and nervous, “if he had a problem.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the year 2014-2015, was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a medical leave due to some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s recruitment policy meant that the claim for which Lamb had worked was not automatically guaranteed the office of the assistant professor.
University director William LaForge told me that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After leaving the campus, the police figured out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had removed himself with 38-calibre guns in the backyard of the house in Mississippi Greenville, about a half a mile away from his parents’ home, the Washington County Death Investigator Methel Johnson told me.
Lamb's car was still on the yard.
The police didn't find out why Lamb had just gone to this house, but Johnson said he believed that he knew the people of the house.
He spent in the area of his youth.
Lamb began his work as a teacher in geography and education at a university with 3 500 students. The city had 12 000 inhabitants in 2009.
In spring, he received a doctoral value in education.
One of Lamb’s long-term friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me he met Lamb through friends when he was 15 and Lamb 20.
She was still in high school with her friends, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston guitar play for years.
“The Lamb was a pretty heartbreaker.
All the girls were on him," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's premiere in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss have been dating for a while.
At the emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but according to any document, they were not married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in the riversweet in the small town of Gautier.
According to the police, the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me he was divorced from Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had stayed friends, and they had a daughter who is now 19.
"He was completely shocked," said O'Steen of his daughter.
"The daughter and mother were the best friends."
O'Steen had not met Lamb but heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both appeared in the summer event three years ago.
Later, they also played together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter is composing and performing his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at a modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, when Lamb had played guitar and lipstick to a rare audience.
Nothing said that something was wrong.
"A happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We were playing together.
Both had a good sense of humor.”
“Surma received professor Schmidt directed first year seminars and specialized in the history of Indians and colonial times,” said English professor Don Allan Mitchell.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied in Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own brotherhood and college.
At the campus of Delta State University, Cleveland has 900 people gathered at a memorial meeting in the light of the candle. There were teachers, other staff, students and residents in the area.
Schmidt’s wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the night event where the choir of the university presented the songs “Bright Morning Star” and “Amazing Grace.”
Learning continues on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get students back,” LaForge said.
“The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis report about Mississippi Cleveland.
Helping journalists: Associated Press journalists Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, because the police are now telling me that Lamb called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also explained that even though Lamb referred to the emergency call as Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not plan to hire seasonal workers as much as last year. However, the retailer of toys and baby products tells his current employees and seasonal workers that they offer an opportunity for additional working hours.
The company is planning to hire 40 000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country. In 2014 it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The interviews of applicants will begin this month, and the new employees will start in loga-december.
Although there are still months of vacation, the trade season approaches a good step, and companies prepare to hire temporary workforce for shops, as well as for the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "treatment" with Princess Diana
Back to the future, the first night of the film was a great moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night was also personal.
"We were sitting in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royals, and I noticed there was an empty place next to me.
"When the movie started, I realized that the situation reminded me of a lot of dates with the Princess of Wales."
Back in Time is related to the future films, and in addition to Fox, the document interviews Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future, the film got its first night 30 years ago.
“This movie is definitely a time travel movie for me all the time,” Spielberg said.
Back in Time is published in VOD and DVD formats and is presented in selected film theatres since October.
UN Secretary General: No military solution in Syria
The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's enhanced military action and notes that there is no military solution to almost five years of conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again urged all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to combine their strengths and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At the press conference held on Wednesday, Ban told his intentions to meet five permanent Member States of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would later be scheduled in the context of the Ministerial Week of the UN General Assembly this month.
Ban regrets that the dispersion of the Security Council, Syrian people and regional powers has caused the situation that is impossible to resolve.
Ban urged five permanent Member States to demonstrate similar solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis in which the Iranian nuclear agreement was reached.
8 chapters of support surveys: Is Donald Trump serious?
Trump has been tried to be an empty speaker.
He was also considered a joke.
Some predict the collapse of Trump.
In the Republican circles, (the 12th) no results have been achieved in every way to pull Trump down from the gallup wire.
The tenteen national gallups show Donald Trump two-digit support figures, some of which are already serious about what it says in practice about the conditions of the real estate mogul.
The elections are only in the beginning.
There has not yet been announced that Trump is elected candidate of Republicans.
Experts remind me that Rick Perry in the galaxy in 2011 was allowed to give room to the rising Herman Cain, and in the end none of the states won a candidate tumor.
Trump would be difficult for many reasons in the general election.
External groups, such as Jeb Bush Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth, have noted Trump’s strong position and began digging their digs to capture him.
The following fresh gallup data indicate that real estate mogulia cannot be ignored with an appendix on the shoulder:
Trump's support has been a full translation.
Just before Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, only two of the ten Republicans, according to the University of Monmouth, had a positive picture of the property mogul.
By mid July, 40% had a positive idea.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Six out of ten Republicans now have a positive picture of Donald Trump.
About three in ten are negative.
These figures are also considered in states where elections are held first.
Last week in the Quinn Market Gallup, 60% of the Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the Republicans would be pleased with Trump's candidate.
In the CNN and ORC gallup last week, 67% of Republicans said they were very pleased or satisfied with Trump’s possible choice as a candidate.
Only two in ten would be very unsatisfactory about Trump's candidate.
Ben Carson receives almost as enthusiastic reception as Trump (43% would be very pleased with Carson's candidate and 40% Trump's candidate).
Who is the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a corresponding support rate of 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be unsatisfactory or extremely unsatisfactory if Jeb Bush were elected candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temperament to be problematic.
Donald Trumpia has been criticised in a wide range of magnificentity and insulting comments. 52% of Republicans’ supporters across the globe consider the properties of the real estate mogul to be the most suitable for the president. The views are shown by ABC News and Washington Post.
The same number applies to Iowa, where the party meeting will be held first: according to the Quinn Market Gallup, 52% of Republicans consider Trump's personal characteristics to be suited to the Head of Defence Forces.
However, according to the ABC and Post gallupe, 44% believe that Trump is unable to function effectively, and six of the ten people consider Trump’s temperament inappropriate to the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are inquired, who is most likely to be elected candidate for the party, according to CNN and ORC gallupe, four of ten believes in Trump’s potential.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on behalf of Jeb Bush.
Overall, the Republicans have not previously had a very reliable crystal ball.
At this stage, four of the last 10 Republicans considered Rick Perry as a probable candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
Most people seem to think Trump's campaign is inconvincing.
Although the Republicans support another candidate, Trump covers almost all other candidates.
Some experts consider that the distributed camp is likely to benefit Trump when Trump’s opponents are divided into the supporters of different candidates.
At the beginning of September, Monmouth University’s opinion survey revealed that Trump and almost any other Republican candidate would have a larger support team almost always.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's at the level.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take the victory from Trump to 19 points in a imaginary double-play.
A small majority of Trump's voters have already made a vote.
According to the CBS and the NYT on Tuesday, fair half of Trump's supporters are sure of their voting decision.
Of course, the situation may change for many reasons, and now a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump’s supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump’s very competitor is a neurosurgeon of Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidates vote twice as likely to vote on Trump.
Six of ten Republicans agree with Trump’s view of migration.
Donald Trump, in his campaign speech two months ago, has been a hot topic for migrants from Mexico to rape.
Some are concerned that Trump’s magnificent speeches expelled important Latin American voters from the Republican troops and hinder the brand’s renewal.
According to ABC News and Washington Post, six of ten Republicans, however, are on the same lines of migration with Trump.
As long as migration is in the light bowl, it is also Donald Trump.
Unsatisfactory to the administration is at the top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republican votes. The popularity is significantly increased by the fact that both of them have come to an external condition.
In the Republican troops, instead of a political conkar, the candidate is a fresh face. According to the latest survey of ABC News and Washington Post, the Republicans had six of ten opinions.
These two candidates are also angry with Washington.
According to the report by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa have been frustrated by the activities of Republicans in Congress: 54% are unhappy and 21% on the rage side."
Jeremy Corby's Debut at the Prime Minister's Question Hour
After the elections, Corbyn's first presentation at the Prime Minister's Question Hour has been welcomed
Jeremy Corbyn, a new swing picture of the Labour Work Party, is going to be the first to stop his forces at David Cameron's interview hours later.
Corbyn asks about his first six questions a little after the afternoon, and media and representatives of the Labour Party follow the man with a hard eye.
Corby has called for less theatre and added the facts for the weekly show.
He also said he could miss some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
In meeting Corbyn’s leadership will be weighed for the first time in connection, and Corby will now be subjected to a parliamentary test after the gathering of the shadow government and the Corbyn Trade Unions’ Central Organization at TUC’s annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision of the Labour Party to remain silent during the national song on Tuesday’s 75th anniversary of the British Air War has been criticized by several representatives of the Tory Party. The silence has also ended up in the titles of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national singing
Corbyn’s representative said that Corbyn was standing during the national song in silence to respect the heroism of the Royal Air Forces in the Battle of Britain.
However, Corbyn’s shadow government member Owen Smith told BBC’s Two's Newsnight that he would have called the party’s leader to join the national song despite the opposition of this monarchy.
The tenth shadow ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn's first-party controversy in economic, defence and foreign matters. At least sixth of the party initially supported the choice of Corbyn to the party.
BBC’s policy correspondent Robin Brant believes that political disagreements on the EU membership of the United Kingdom and the conditions for granting government benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party after Corbyn’s appointment.
Corbyn said at the TUC meeting that the Labour would propose changes to completely remove restrictions.
Hours later, Minister of Labour and Pensions of the shadow government said that the party's position is very clear: it only opposes the government's plans to calculate the limit from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corby is the fifth Labour Director David Cameron meets over the past decade under the command of the Tory Party.
The new approach to politics promised by the Labour Director says he chose to ask Cameron questions from the public for 30,000 proposals.
According to Corbyn’s electoral district of Islington, there are too many confrontations in the survey, he promises to avoid smart vocabulary and loan throwing, and says he focuses on serious topics such as poverty, inequality and young people’s challenges.
Corby has stated that Secretary of Shadow Angela Eagle is taking him to survey hours, for example, when Cameron is on his way abroad.
Corby has also thrown away the idea that others can sometimes vote, and he says he has discussed this with Mr Bercow, President of the House.
Corbyn joined the party in 2005, Cameron said he wanted a doll-teatter policy that often relates to the questioning hour, but some years later he admitted that he failed in his effort.
Since the first time the survey time was broadcast in 1990, it has been considered a key measure of the manager’s criticism, sub-room management and status. According to critics, however, the survey tutorial has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": Homeless Young Photographers
Johannesburg is a homeless environment.
The group of former street children has found a smart way to learn and earn.
"I was shot in Joburg" is an unprofitable description studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their homeland and deserve at the same time.
BBC News met a young man who has been completed through the project among the first.

The pound increases when UK wages rise
The pound was strengthened when the wages increased in the UK, and SABMiller pulled the FTSE 100 indices.
In May–July, wages increased by 2.9% in the UK compared to the corresponding period last year.
The faster growth that was predicted was the fastest since 2009.
The pound increased by 1%, and its course was quoted by $1505. The pound was also strengthened in relation to the euro, and it was quoted by 1.3730 euros.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and ended at 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose course was 20 per cent painful when the company received an initial purchase offer from the competing company AB InBev.
When the trade was carried out, the two largest brewery companies in the world would bring brands under the same roof, including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share increased by 0.9 per cent in the old water of the Richemont Group’s positive results focusing on luxury products.
Richemont’s latest sales figures are better than forecast. The sales trend was also rising in Burberry’s key markets in China.
Glencore’s share increased by 5% of its reported intentions to collect 2.5 billion dollars as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The package and paper group Mond’s shares were the largest fallen by 4.3% when Goldman Sachs dropped the company’s share price for sale.
The JD Sports course increased by 3.1 per cent after announced by the sport company that its return before taxes will rise to 83 per cent of 46.6 million pounds.
JD Sports Boss: greater wage spending could be detrimental to enlargement
According to the JD Sports Chairman Peter Cowgill, a minimum wage increase in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not enough to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs may jeopardise JD Sports’ enlargement plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grassroot campaign against Ald's belt
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA store from Aldi's takeover in South and Western Australia.
Metcash has launched a lawn root campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retails in South and Western Australia against the invasion of USD 700 million.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the beginning of the next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand on the market in mainstream communications and social media, and organize events such as Adelaide-show.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, Simmo, the ice cream factory located in Dunsborough offers tastes in IGA stores, and traders sell stock customers tickets for South Australian football league games at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade market will organise the annual investment strategy date.
It is a significant market, since South and Western Australia represents nearly 30% of the footprint of Metcashi’s IGA stores, and in these areas the coverage is higher than the IGA retail network of Eastern States.
South and Western Australian consumers are known for their neighbourhood, and the IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia, the market share is 30% and West Australia 24%, while in eastern states only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi captures 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA traders can sell 360 million and Metcash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 stores in South and Western Australia next year and reaches $500 million and $600 million in these regions.
Metcashi’s fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can mean a loss of $13 million before interest rates and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in eastern states, mainly to Ald and Coles, even though Roy Morgan’s recent study suggests that IGA’s customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi’s food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading portfolio manager of the Magella Financial Group Hamish Douglass told me at the event held in Melbourne that Metcash would disappear completely within 10 years.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcashi Board contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of the IGA has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010 and the result of Metcashi’s food business that serves the IGA successor has fallen 43% from the level of 2012.
However, the wholesale trader takes counterparts and makes over $150 million annual harvests in order to respond to the prices of hundreds of products in Coles and Woolworths per week. Ketju wants to support traders in the renovation of shops so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the range of foods for their own brands.
According to Metcashi CEO Ian Morrice, price review and shop reform plans are in good speed, and the company is able to increase its profit for the first time in 2017 for four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Union, defends Thanas from Cook
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special reputation instead of a criticism.
According to the Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a side victim in a recent Nick Kyrgios-related jupaka.
The younger party of the two named "Special K" dude, Kokkinakis, got into an unfavorable lightstone when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrink at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly after that, in the quarry fight between Cincinnatis and Ryan Harrison, the judge had to separate the competitors twice. "Wawrinkan should have given her back to the Kyrgios and my guy," Harrison said.
In the U.S. open, Kokkinakis frustrated the field of the mail when the powerful cramps ruined his match. Healy has faithfully defended the Cooks.
Currently, the teenage ceremony is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth, the second player of the single games behind Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup's semi-final against the United Kingdom.
“I strongly believe that Thanasi has been drawn according to its dispute,” Healy said.
“He broke the mail when he lost the match in the open Americans, and he’s not the first player to break his mail because of frustration. I know Thanas so well that he’s not proud of his work.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocative use of Harrison in the U.S. open, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a gloss opera around, and I think he has only been treated fairly.
He is very mature at the age of 19, he works hard and completes the team. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He practices hard, is in good condition and really stable and mature young man. I think he should be evaluated on the basis of his own marines."
Healy also supports the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team from an important round that begins on the recession. Healy describes the solution for a common decision for all parties, but he supports the return of Canberra to the long-term reinforcement of the team.
First of all, we want to focus entirely on the matches instead of the polemies related to Kyrgios,” Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. However, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, a young man has to grow up in the light bowl of the public. He deserves the criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we are trying to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to organize his own peace. I believe that it is best for both the team and Nick.”
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
As an emergency, Hungary closed its southern borders from Serbia’s direction on Tuesday and captured illegal migrants, which was intended to prevent the flow of the migrant.
There was a chaos on the border when hundreds of migrants accumulated into a non-stop country, and the Serbian authorities react ragely.
People fleeing violence had to stay on the road between inspection stations in their tents for an indefinite period.
The frustration began to rise to the surface.
When the police were flying in the air above the migrants, they hovered "Open the border!" and screamed offensives to the Hungarian riot police.
Some became a protest to the eating and drinking strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it does not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase the damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in the next few days in Brussels and in other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Death on the border between Hungary and Serbia began a day later when 28 state groups failed to develop a common migration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed that the responsibility for the flooding of 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was common, and that the meeting had the desire to reach an agreement on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including Hungary, by the next month or by the end of the year.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria summoned a further summit on Tuesday for the next week in order to discuss the migration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary did not hope for urgent action in Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that in two southern regions, the authorities were able to implement more efficient means, i.e. to close you and to speed up legal processes relating to asylum matters.
At the same time, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a wireless wire to the border of Romania to prevent the flow of the migration flow from that direction, now that the Serbian border is already ready for the aid.
CBS News' correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the tender for the finalisation of the Hungarian-Serbian wirework.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck for migrants and a transit point for the European Union. Many of these migrants are refugees from Syria and from the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that most of the people who arrive are living refugees, not those who have the right to seek security, and that the view differs dramatically from the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to the new law which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, a crime is to exceed or damage four metres of wireless fence, built by the government towards the southern border of Serbia, and the law also defines further prisoners for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass change, the government declares a crisis situation in the country," Zoltan Kovacs, announced to journalists in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We follow the strict line: illegal crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament must continue to accept military action that is expected next week, and the suppliers of the Associated Press news agency have seen heavy-armed soldiers with vehicles and military dogs on the border for several days.
Orban’s Internal Security Advisor Gyorgy Bakondi told that the authorities have captured 45 crossings of attempts immediately at the border and 15 beyond.
Helping people crossing the border are now in possession of the police, accused of offences based on new laws.
The authorities repair the fence quickly.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossings at the Serbian border on Tuesday. One border crossing was closed by means of a rail wagon covered with a wire.
The chaos took over the main border crossing position near Roske in Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small metal container in which people were packed in.
There were about 20 people inside, but thousands of people left out.
The second group of migrants blocked the main street that connects Serbia and Hungary. People announced to be in the food and drinkhouse until they were released to Hungary.
Choices 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership towards Bernie Sanders is reduced by the national gallupe
Former foreign minister Hillary Clinton's support rate is still two-digit in the race for the national presidential candidate of democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders has closed the distance.
Clinton's support is now 47% of democrats' votes (about 58%), while Sanders is the second with 27% (up to 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure to the presidential race, with 15% of his position among the democrats.
More than five months before the election, most of the democrats are too early to tell who the candidate is in favour of.
However, Clinton’s supporters are more confident about the choice of other candidates.
After the galluc of CBS News last month, Clinton has lost the support of several democratic groups, while the Sanders camp has joined new supporters.
Clinton still has a strong leadership role among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has fallen significantly, and he has only a 5% bow over Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership among the democrats under the age of 50 and is now at a level with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton’s advantage in the support sections of Sanders was two-digit among the liberals, but now Sanders has taken a five-percent-century neck to Clinton in this group.
Approximately half of the Democrats will be happy to support Clinton if he is elected candidate for the party.
The fourth would support Clinton with the smallest reservations, and 15 percent would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support Clinton.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters would also be particularly enthusiastic if he was elected candidate.
There is more disintegration among those who are currently not in favour of Clinton. Only about a quarter would be eager to support him.
48% of the Democrat voters would support Clinton, and only 35% of the Republican voters would insist on the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When Clinton voters are freely asked to describe why they support his candidates, the most popular reason is Clinton’s correct experience (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to choose the female presidency (13%) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention his relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
In addition, there are convergence views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The Vice-President still puntered his potential candidates, and 57% of the democrats would like him to go to the race, and a third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the second most popular candidate is inquired of democratic voters as candidates of the party, most people choose Biden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and significantly more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the candidate competition of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton will increase his way forward to Sanders, while the Sanders are involved with the advantage of 20 percentage points, and it will grow to 30 percentage points if Sanders don't go to the race.
55% of the democrat voters consider Clinton as candidates who have the best chance to win the actual elections, but the proportion has fallen from 78% last month.
The second Biden is far from Clinton, but more and more believes in Biden's chances of winning the actual elections.
Democrat voters, however, consider the views of the candidates to be more important than the chances of winning.
The voters do not like democratic or potential candidates as unacceptable.
The voters regard democratic candidates or potential candidates as suitable for their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable and managerial types.
Biden is mostly described as honest, while Clinton is mostly considered a leader.
Up to 30% of Democrat voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, but 15% of Sanders. 27% do not know whether Sanders is honest.
Democrat voters believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden’s views are close to their own ideology.
For all the features, about a quarter of them, there is no opinion on Sanders.
When the voters are asked for views on the use of Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail and its own server as Minister for Foreign Affairs, most of the democrats say they are satisfied with the Clinton explanation and have not altered the concept of these voters of Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half of the Americans are unhappy with the Clinton investigation, and only one third is satisfied.
The people’s opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
Most Americans believe that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36 percent say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36 percent, six out of ten, are Republicans.
While the voters of their party regard Clinton as honest and trustworthy, these features have the opportunity to improve the views of all voters: Clinton is considered to be only 32% honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump get good reviews of leadership.
Six of the candidates Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
The majority think Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion about Sanders.
The sample is 351 voters and the error margin of the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson catches Donald Trump in a national support survey
According to CBS News and New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates strangled more than half of the votes in the new survey and left the other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has strong support. The support rate has risen from 23% of the CBS survey made before the Fox News last month. According to the survey published on Tuesday, the support share is 27%.
However, Carson's support would increase to a huge increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has a strong support in all population groups.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, will stay far away. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support is weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio shared the third position with 6% support.
The error margin of 376 Republican voters is 6% or more. The survey was carried out in September.
According to the latest survey published by CNN and ORC last week, Carson's support is rising. It is worth 19% of Republicans when Trump's support is 32%.
In the latest survey from ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was a clear leader in Carson.
During the last week of the meeting of men, Trump shot inevitable charges for a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized after questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday when he campaigned in Iowa.
Five members of the department accused of the death of Baruch College Fux
Nearly two years ago, after the death of a student in the ritual of Pennsylvania Poconoviro, five people are counted as murder charges.
The Baruch College (City University of New York), Pi Delta Ps, members of the department, hated brutally Chun "Michael" Deng in the baptists held in September 2013. According to the police, the department did not deliver Deng in time to the hospital, which was considered to contribute to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were tied, his back was placed on a bag filled with almost 15 kilos of sand and had been repeatedly attacked when he tried to get to the site that was placed on the other side of the ice pello.
Deng was told first that he complained about headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of the Pi Delta Ps department did not call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, allegedly waited an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
At the press conference, Chief Chris Wabner told me that members had the opportunity to change Deng's clothes, googlata his symptoms, and contact Andy Mengi, President of the Department.
“In this stage, Members began to hide the tools by setting the interest of the department in the health of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
Deng was not recovered, and he died the next morning.
Dental opening protocol says Deng had been hit several times in the head, upper body, and thigh with a boring object.
“A lot of families have been shocked by the simplicity of the department, as at least one student per year has died as a result of a smoothing decade since 1970,” says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng.
The departments and their members must be accounted for where the authorities need to take an important step.
The grand jury of Monroe County presented five members of the department to be accused of the murder of the third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the department will be charged with imprisonment and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
“We want to be responsible not only for individuals, but also for an organization formally or unofficially accepted,” Wagner told the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College set a ban on the operation of the department, and the national department resigned from the local department.
This is how the increase in the interest rate of the United States Central Bank (Fedin) affects
The increase in interest rates and the increase in the stock market has been delicate, the return on securities is rising and the economy is slipping down.
That's what we know.
We do not know how long all will take time and how long the effects will last.
In particular, for the economy, we will find a share in history in the timing.
Lama has arrived in up to 11 months after the first interest increase and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, but not always. The key factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
Therefore, the central bank officials have already stressed that investors should not pay attention when the interest rate increase begins, but how long it takes to normalise the situation.
Of course, there are a number of variables involved.
In the end, however, market operators can note that all interest increases can be overreacted.
“After the global financial crisis, the first increase in the central bank was often seen as a sign of the end of cheap money,” Julian Jessop, the Capital Economics chief global economist, told his customers.
However, we do not expect the gradual normalisation of interest to a fairly low level. It is a scary standing shock for many.
However, this does not mean that there is no impact.
Here are examples of how the impacts can be seen in different areas of the economy:
As has been seen in the market for about a month, the expectation of the increase in interest rates can increase in instability for some time.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
“The trend would appear to be the recession of capital interest income after the first increase for 12 to 24 months, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy, Deutsche Bank’s analyst said in a recent study of the consequences of increases in interest rates.
Over 35 years, the market is generally seen as a sharp increase at the time of the increase in interest rates, approximately 14 per cent, fairly stable for the following 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), after 500 days, the situation is normalised, and the average interest rate gain is 14.4 per cent after the six shares, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management’s main equity strategy in Barron’s magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares generally increases slightly later cycles and interest income begins to decrease.
Lama is a fact in the economy, but the increase in interest rates usually works.
In this case, if the central bank meets the circumstances that were not present before and could speed up the bill.
Particular attention is the fact that the gross national product is at the lowest possible in view of the increase in the central bank's governance rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the increase in the 118 steering rate was then 1950, only twice the nominal value was less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 appears to be 3.6%, many did not think it would be sustainable, and in the third quarter it would be 1.5%, the Atlanta Regional Central Bank said.
In raising interest rates such a sensitive economic situation, there may be a risk and it can be asked whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
On the market, operators have spoken about the increase in the governance rate throughout the year, and the views will turn to this week's Open Market Committee meeting, which will end on Thursday.
Many strategics and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee would approve the increase at this meeting, the future trade will only show the likelihood of 25%.
"In our studies since 1950, all the lift cycles have been in a supercycle, where the GDP before the fall will rise very quickly after the decline of the rise," the report says.
Recovery has been very slow compared to the worst in the comparative period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last stage. The record had been 35 months, now it is already going to be 74 months.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable in the market enthusiasm, and the formula is also recurring on capital.
"The difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than in shares when the central bank changes the course.
In the case of group bonds, the return appears to change the direction immediately when the first increase/loss cycle starts.
At the end of the rising cycle, revenues will drop immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategicists believe that the interest rate purchase will allow long-term and short-term bonds to approach each other and level the curve.
“We are more often better in such a environment, even though we are still careful about income,” said Schwab’s analyst for fixed-term securities.
Interestingly, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future direction of the central bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the doll and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs to adapt to the tightening of financial policy," Jones said.
The short-term interest rates are rising, the return curve is direct, the credit risk margins are expanded and volatility increased. All are typical in the market in a situation where the central bank tightens politics.
In broad terms, companies that operate mainly on the US market benefit as the interest rate decreases and local products begin to attract.
The prospects of obligated multinational companies are weaker, as the strong dollar will make their products rise in the global market and the debt rise.
"History shows that quality shares are more profitable over the next three months of interest," Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with strong balance sheets defeated the weak balance sheet companies after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average by five percentage units.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatile shares also improved their quality, on average 4 and correspondingly 3 percentage points better.
"There's a big question.
Entrepreneurs with a significant share of debts lose the most," Goldman said.
In addition to the stock market, consumers generally benefit from strengthening the dollar.
Savings also benefit from higher yields, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects will appear.
Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for excessive popularization.
According to Bingham, channels are now difficult to separate from their commercial competitors.
It also claims the BBC Music Awards award only as a copy of the British Gala.
Mr Damien Collins, on the other hand, blames the The Voice channel for personality.
According to the significant parliamentarians, BBC Radio 3 gradually turns into a copy of the Classic FM channel. The accusations increase pressure on the station to prove that each of the other commercial radio stations offers.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC’s leadership that the broadcaster’s radio channel is becoming too popular and that the channel is no longer separate from its commercial competitor.
“I don’t want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be changing towards the Classic FM channel,” Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards Awards Awards Awards won by Bingham in December as well:
Last year, the BBC Music Awards will appear as a copy of the British Awards.
These two are examples of the fact that, instead of a new and different one, it is simply to imitate what is already on the market,” Bingham says.
BBC’s Director-General banned the charges and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers a significant increase in live music and enlightening content of commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 learns from classical music what I can't learn from other channels.
The channel’s commitment to live music and music is entirely in its own class.
I also find it important that Radio 3 is also committed to searching for new music and ordering new works," the president said.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, head of BBC Radio 3, said that the station needs to work harder to maintain public interest, because the British know classical music better.
Radio 3 is not, however, the only strong criticism in the consultation of the BBC channel, limited cultural, media and sports committee.
The Tory Party Parliamentary Damien Collins criticized the The Voice Championship, which BBC purchased from the Dutch producer Talpa Media. The price of the trade is estimated at 22 million £.
“It’s not much to talk about, because it’s not unique or especially distinct.”
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, which, as Star Judges, was produced by Paloma Faith and Boy George, in a typical way of BBC.
In addition, Collins asked the company to look for a hit program in his own taxi when it next time enters a new entertainment series.
However, Collins refused to exclude the “The Voice” series from being ordered or that the taxpayer’s money would be used for other forms of entertainment.
The slowest growth in online trade in August – perhaps black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online trade increased by 7%.
The sales of online trade have been statistics since 2000, and last month the growth was the slowest in all times.
The online trade was strengthened three years ago with mobile purchases.
Experts believe that November's black Friday can curb shopping desires.
For more than ten years, the conquest of online trade has devastated many of the UK shopping skates.
According to experts, there are indications that online trade is in line, and the new sales figures show only 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth of total sales was the slowest throughout the period when the sales of online trade have been statistically recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, only five per cent increased.
According to experts, there are indications that online trade is in line, and the new sales figures show only 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If we compare the growth of the last year to the 2000s, it’s clear that growth balances over time,” IMRG’s main editor Andy Mulcahy told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online trade was accelerated three years ago when consumers took mobile purchases.
With it, more and more people were able to buy from the network, and many of them were able to buy in different environments, even with their home masks.
When mobile purchases are now more moderate, growth can be balanced."
The black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is considered one of the reasons for slowing growth.
According to experts, the theme day spent on the last Friday of November can make consumers postpone the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, the five-fold number of online purchasers compared to the normal, caused many traders’ websites to fall.
Experts believe that the black Friday, which makes consumers to tune after the offers, can curb the purchase requests during the rest of the period.
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, a fair pound per five pounds was consumed online.
More than a third of certain products, such as television and washing machines, are purchased from online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes instead of fashion tiles purchased from the network.
In the Meka, the victims of lifting accidents are buried, Bin Laden's family is responsible for
The Muslims carried 29 bodies on the streets when the first funerals were held in Mekka.
According to Saudi Arabia, the large construction company Saudi Binladin Group is involved in the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the lift fell.
The bodies were carried in high air when the Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the fallen lift on Mekka's Great Mosque
On the streets, a number of white-dressed people had gathered to say goodbye to the victims on their last journey to the graveyard of Al-Moaissem.
The tragedy went to a pilgrim where the fallen builder was only a day earlier invaded through the mosque roof of Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia demands a family company in the construction industry of Bin Laden to be responsible for an accident in which 394 people were injured.
The 29 dead victims were transported on the streets in the lifting accident of Mekka's Great Mosque.
After the fall of the nosturi among the dead, Qasim Akram, from Bolton of the Great Manchester, had traveled to Meka in his first pilgrim.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents who had started their annual holiday trip.
Saudi Arabia's authorities have promised that the sanctuary of Hajj will be held when thousands of people are currently coming to the city for pilgrim.
King Salman said Binladin Group shouldn’t have left up the nost when the nost was not used.
According to the Arab press release, Binladin Group is involved in the accident.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report it in detail, but according to the English-language communication, the group’s management has been prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what led to the fall of the lifter in the yard of the Great Mosque. Thousands of Muslims are heading to the Great Mosque later on this month.
Binladin Group has not published a notice of a lifting accident and the group’s representatives have not been targeted for an opinion.
The king also accused the group of failing to comply with the up-to-date safety rules and collaborating with meteorology experts.
Ten lifters are surrounded by Mekka's Great Mosque as part of Binlad's Group's giant construction project.
Bin Laden’s family has been close to Saudi Arabia’s rulers for decades, and Bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
Al Qaida’s executive, Osama bin Laden, was an apostle boy who had been abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
The rainfall in the hard rain and in the hard wind occurred only a few days before the pilgrim of Meka, who is the duty of each capable Muslim to do at least once in life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital care.
The authorities ordered million rials (a.k.a. EUR 250 000) to the victims’ family and permanent injuries.
Other injured persons will receive half of the compensation.
According to the B&Q Bomb, there is a cheap Eastern European labour force behind the phenomenon.
The British are more often hiring generals at home, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by the skilled and professional workers from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores are opened for employees.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.

It is said that the British are moving home hammering and painting to the authors coming from Eastern Europe.
Vasarization and painting skills seem to be rare today.
The British are now increasingly hiring home generals to manage home nickarization work, says the company leader behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is a new CEO in Kingfisher, which owns the home renovation chain. According to Laury, the phenomenon is based on professional workers coming from Eastern Europe who provide services at poorest prices.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Screwfix stores for traders. At the same time, 60 B&Q stores are closed.
Laury needs more women's workforce for B&Q stores, because eight of the ten purchase decisions in the store make a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, it is worth paying attention to the trends of populations, as today more and more single women are renovating their homes.
“Our sales staff are still mostly men,” Laury says.
“We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions make a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the five women who are in the corner of the British FTSE 100 companies, and has also reorganised the company’s management group so that men and female leaders are equal.
Kingfisher is almost the only of its quality, as 50% of its staff are women, including the CEO and the Financial Director.
“This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us,” Laury said.
"It has not been hard to find good women in the leadership group."
Kingfisher’s half-year profit and sales figures have fallen, even though the company was working hardly after the abolition of shops.
Kingfisher responds to the current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The government of three aces decided to rely on mandatory legislation to save the economy of the country.
The visible effects were quite rapidly achieved.
The sharp head of the SAK and other wageholder centre organisations began to force the country to stand on Friday due to a broad demonstration of workers.
A lot of people also think that there is sense.
Let's ask if it's worth strikes when it's going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people on the internet have already been reporting that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, but going to work.
In the old good time of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but it would have been a political suicide for a small person to be declared a wealthy.
Millions of professional organisations are not much delayed by the protest of a few ten thousand people, but the subject of thinking is given.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it has been twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government’s brutal solutions can also be seen as a direct gift to heaven.
When things have appeared to be rolling on their own weight for years, now the unions finally get involved, i.e. the rights of the employee to defend, be visible and properly.
Thus, the government may want to imprison the role of the ay movement, when membership in the union may be seen more necessary than before.
We have any opinions about the activities of the organizations, so it is nuts that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has declined 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
These things would force everyone's head.
Hard savings for the University of Lappeenranta: A target of 8.5 million savings, staff reduction by 130
The University of Lappeenranta starts a savings course with a view to getting costs reduced by EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings of the university, the general public negotiations on the entire staff will be launched, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means reducing around 130 employees.
In addition, two million other activities are aimed at saving.
The budget for 2016 is based on the YT negotiations, which is expected to be 8.5 million in deficit.
It is also affected by the budget cuts made by the government.
During this financial year, the university makes about 2.6 million deficits.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time, the funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between massive teaching and research cuts and the reduction of corporate funding in our university is very important, says director Anneli Pauli at the University.
Before the summer, the impacts of the surgery appeared even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with trustees will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last six weeks prescribed by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants the Finnish railroads
The owner of Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in travelling to Finland.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail transport companies in Britain, Souter says.
Rail transport is expected to be open to competition gradually.
The first is the near transport of the capital area between 2017 and 2018.
After the nearest traffic, there is far-reaching traffic.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport is welcome to the plans of Onnibus.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has announced its interest in rail transport in other international companies, which also has bus traffic in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
the United States Central Bank
The whole world will follow the US Central Bank Fed meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible increase in interest for the first time for almost a decade.
A fair half of the economists, who believed that the central bank would raise interest rates last week, now believing that the central bank will maintain interest rates in the current 0–0.25%. This is reflected in the survey made by the 80 economic scientists of Reuters.
“This is a historical situation, as the central bank has kept the interest rate in zero for seven years.
For the first time, we approach the situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero levels and thus start normalisation of interest rates,” Peterson’s Institute for International Economics’ senior researcher Angel Ubide said.
The state of the U.S. economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought into balance billions of additional dollars and accelerated just a little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation that is not as rose.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also references to the opposite.
The decision will be published on Thursday 20.00 Central European time.
Delta State University Shooter left an apology card
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before shooting a colleague later on the same day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologizes for the first murder and hopes he could withdraw it, the authorities said on Tuesday.
At Mississippi Gautier Delta State University, Lamb who teaches science and social sciences called the emergency number about 10:00 a.m.
Monday and said he shot a man.
Lamb called for an emergency call to the police at home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me. He also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, which has no harm to anyone but who is probably scared.
The police asked the caller's name, but the man didn't tell me that.
Lamb also didn't tell me the motive for shooting.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, a message written by the body, and Lamb, in which he read: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could cancel my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University where he killed his history professor Ethan Schmidt before he lost his life late Monday when the police reached him.
University director William LaForge told me that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
On Monday it was reported that Lamb expected to believe that Prentiss was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt. However, the authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence about the triangle drama.
With Prentiss for seven years, Shawn O'Steen was married to his former wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said she and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is shocked.
The man said the daughter and mother were the best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss Lindsay Knowles told me that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told a woman about the dog named Lightning.
“He always wanted to help others,” Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives during Monday and told them that he was not going to prison.
When the police reached Lamb Highway 1 near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, escaped the foot, ran into the forest and killed himself.
According to the CV on the University website, Lamb received a doctoral degree in Delta State University in spring 2015.
Silent Stars
The last few years have been heavy for an actress (in a picture of his left son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actress has also been involved with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for the possession of drugs.
Everything that happened has really required its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw page for months due to two fractures
Luke Shaw's right foot broke in the Manchester United Master's League against PSV Eindhoven.
But Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the field for this period.
A 20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defense area in the bad fight against Héctor Moreno when the game was running for 15 minutes.
Shaw got first aid on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he's in hospital," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or after tomorrow for surgery to Manchester.
A young man who joined the Manchester United lines at the age of 18 has experienced a hard experience and is now injured after a wonderful game.
In the suitcase, Shaw was given oxygen.
The man cried.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks in two points, he's on the side for six months and doesn't play in the block phase anymore.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed to have reached a short time when the situation did not follow the red card of punishment.
Nicola Rizzoli was not punishing a mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
“You can conclude yourself, but I think the situation was worth the punishment kick and the red card.
It was a two-foot stack.”
Shaw said, "Thank you all for your messages. I can't tell you how muddled I am. My recovery begins here and I'm coming back stronger."

The English defender has a special reason to recover in order to compete at the European Championships held in France in June.
"The issue has a very bad injury," said the PSV coach.
“In such cases of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
Players will never harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his legs when playing in Mexico's rows, Van Gaali's trusted Netherlands only at the 2014 World Championships.
“He’s very sorry, because his purpose was not to harm the opponent. It’s sad to hear that the injury is serious,” Cocu said.
“I didn’t see the situation.
I only saw a ball that was going in the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's fight."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this can be," Moreno said to the SBS6 channel.
"I feel really bad, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after the crash with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Each parent notices before long that the child learns his favorite book almost outside.
Except you can see David Cameron.
When the Children's Holiday Organization asked Cameron to appoint his favorite children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
In a text published on SuperCamp, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, touching, and creative, and it has a powerful message. I am happy to read it to my children, because there is always a picture or message that we have not seen before."
It sounds good, except that the next point where Cameron is to describe the story of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to complement the short original text.
"Tarville's city, where the right trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is traded, lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of her dream girl Audrey by implementing this biggest dream: see the right tree," the text tells. In 1991 Dr. Seuss, the Theodor Seuss Geisel version, Ted had no purpose of love.
Unless this is still suspicious, Cameron’s text is partly connected with the Lorax film’s plan summary on the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: “In a town where everything is artificial and even air is traded, a son named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of her dream girl Audrey.”
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the story of the book would be such a stranger to him. Ahne Kerskanen will destroy the trees and prepare them for the requirements despite the resistance of Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, stirsty creature that protects forests.
Probably such a small pr task as this is believed to be an assistant, apparently to someone who has not read Lorax 20 times in the tube.
The prime minister told me that the text is probably from the office of the Cameron Election District.
SuperCamps did not comment more on this, but confirmed that the text was the handwriting of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of being away from the British team, but it's still hard.
Pakistan’s meeting in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but we have not seen the recurrence of the last 3-0 test series of the team selected for the UK tour.
I wouldn't close the chance of a guest win.
Alastair Cook’s side can be more unexperienced than a three-year-old team, but the team has good players and the team’s attitude is strong – they have no bad experiences in 2012, just a young positiveness.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a spinner, and Adil Rashid, although he has no experience at Test level, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is clearly difficult for me to understand his main coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been in challenging circumstances against two good attacks, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are criticized according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because – as I have previously said – players are the best choice.
A few 50-point matches would have been held in Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
The main coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he did not succeed as well as he could not have done, which is not surprising me. He is primarily a team player.
The question of how long test holes will be able to make their impressions is difficult.
Lyth had seven land matches – like his predecessor Sam Robson – while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton had an opportunity for both home and guest games.
The only subject of complaint may be that England used Jonathan Trotti first in Caribbean – when Lyth was in the top position – but this past opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team, and he's the hitter I appreciate.
He is an unknown cricket player that we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he made 236 points against us at the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but, of course, this depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea is that Moeen starts a beating shift with Cook, which brings an extra spinner to the game while four fast feeders are held, and I'm not against the idea.
I don’t see a barrier to the excellence of the beating, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moeen may not have received much in his local team at Worcestershire, but he has been a team threesome player and it is not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played their first 38 test matches as the first replacement player before he got started in 2001.
He made three hundred points immediately, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is in the team as a replacement tour, and based on what I have seen of him, he has proven to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistical figures – on average 31 points as a hitter and 35 inputers – and this can be a search shot, but very many spinners have not shown themselves ready, and the voters decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this game trip.
Outside the team, England seems to have made a couple of smart choices for its training staff.
The appointment of the Sri Lanka hitter, Mahela Jayawardenen, as a consultant for Test matches, may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most delicate men of the species who brings a lot of experience because he has played against all kinds of circumstances and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the share of the white ball of the game and brings both energy and mercilessness.
I think he has always influenced a suitable international cricket, whether he is a player or a coach, and, like Mahela, he has a useful intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even though it would say the same as before, can be a cheerleading injection.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, has been resting on one day's matches, Root got the same opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coachs and voters do not set a timetable for the match.
And you need to remember that, like players, their job depends on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without consideration.
Brexit Camp can win if the economy is badly in 2017
David Cameron’s neighbourhood strategy for the UK to stay in the EU is today in a deeper vein, even without a pleasant Jeremy "yes or no" choice for Corbynia to lead the Labour Party or TUC to smiling Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is crising – even though not all of them are doing their own action, some of the Member States have been bored of the UK's own-minded agenda, which includes consensus and harmful changes to the Treaty which they do not really want.
In Brighton, the annual Congress of TUC decided that they would not enjoy social security either in the EU.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agent.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the federation will sit at the summits and bilateral negotiations in the capital cities of different countries, catch a picture of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-value individuals, return home and tell them they have acquired allies for reforms.
Everything has to do with me.
My European friend, who wants to have an open-screen UK inside the EU. "Do not leave us alone with France," Berlin says, and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that we no longer care about whether we are staying or leaving.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s considering rational alliance Chancellor, has been in charge for ten years and wants to leave the office before it pollutes, as it happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Hollande is facing a re-election or the choice of a successor in 2017.
His power is shrinking, too.
Poland will soon have a nationalist right government, Spain’s left government.
It is difficult to imagine them running around to help selfie brits that could better use their energy to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want it because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can design their intentional to throw useless comments on the style of the Scottish National Party in the UK’s 2017 National Election Championship to force Brexit’s process, my friend suggests.
"The newest negotiations were held." "The UK had nothing left in hand about the renegotiation negotiations."
Europeans know how the British press catches and how the EU-sceptical oligarch press is, just like the 1975 referendum by Tony Benn, the result of which supports 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Someone may be remotely remembering Boris Johnson, a striking European opportunist, who became known as our “EU direct banana correspondent” in Brussels at the beginning of the 90s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
These include tax circulates, phones hack and seemingly-speaking residents that own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but then he realized that when he was in a cage with a rough gorilla, he had to give bananas a disguise so that the gorilla wouldn't eat you for both lunch and dinner.
Miliband was even more bourgeois than Blair when he opposed the referendum, and Blair passed on to the Constitution of the EU, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the 2005 referendum, Blair was conveniently released.
The press never forgived him.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly touched me on the back of Westminster on Monday, and I told him he didn't have time to waste on me anymore, and it could be a risk that he would introduce Neil Kinnock in the 80s of the mediabooter strategy. It was a mistake and it's still a mistake.
It may take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a consistent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but Andrew Marrin, who was sitting on the BBC coat on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what we politely call building.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most outside Ukipi and Tory are likely to respond positively.
That's what Hilary "Benn, but not Benniit" Benn told on radio and television this week when his inner patrol boy tried not to admit that there was a bad bet from Corbyn to name Karski John McDonnell as a secret minister.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old father had trouble being unfaithful on TV to his Labour Party Ecolleries without going too far and without losing his place in the subroom.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU in all circumstances. McDonnel did not say that to his colleagues and members of the subroom in private meeting on Monday night.
He wanted Corby to care about how he took the picture, it must be remembered that he even touched me. The message is important for the 24/7 period, especially in the discipline of social media, where paranoia and fraud are hit.
Cameron does not need to be given a free passport in relation to the EU, in which he could consider the support of the Labour as a self-evident in the referendum, as McDonnell has stated.
Simon Jenkins thinks that.
McDonnell’s and Corbyn’s evacuation of EU membership is suitable for the penetration and anti-capitalism past. Discussions no longer belong to a small circle of left-wing differentiators, whose idea that similarity is combined, is a key part of the doctrinal shades.
The Equavation has also been seen in NATO, and Tom Watson is shocking that Corby does not campaign for departure, and foreign diplomats have to try to clarify the matter with their home countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters, why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be unnecessary?
The United States has already been quite disappointed in the miserable military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the operation of the Tory Government, which I received from this reminder on Monday in the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise the British Authority's opinions on electrical cigarettes
According to researchers, the State-funded institution's claims that the burning of electricity cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were born at a meeting of 12 participants with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised evidence from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health England (PHE) report.
PHE described the report published last month for a "reverse and comprehensive review of results".
However, several researchers have questioned the security of information and highlighted the links between some experts in the tobacco industry.
Last month, Lancet Medical Journal’s headline was put on the teeth “the heating base” based on which the PHE’s main conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers have considered in BMJ whether the claims were founded on “call or sand”.
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Professor Martin McKee and professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic assumption of public health care is that the principles of action are based on a clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKeen and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's claim that "the best estimate today suggests that electricity cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on the analysis and modeling of detailed research results.
The argument is that of one 12-person meeting, which was summed up for the development of a multi-criter model based on a multi-criter decision analysis, MCDA. The model wanted to harmonize the views of participants on the disadvantages of nicotine products. The results were summarised in the study.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the meeting was supported by EuroSwiss Health, which has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT), the former independent research of the CEO.
In addition, in the Sustainable Action Report, the CEO showed its support for BAT’s activities in the field of public health.
One of the 12 participants of the meeting granted funding from the electric aid manufacturer. However, the alleged earlier funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted by that participant.
However, there are several well-known supporters of electrical cigarettes, some of which contribute to the industry as a funder.
However, some participants are not familiar with their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE Sugar Officer.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the Group’s research report shows that there is no undisputed evidence of the harmfulness of products in the context of a wide range of products and their criteria.
However, links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, there has been no evidence that electric cigarettes can promote smoking for children or non-smoking. McKee and Capewell regard the claim as premature.
PHE’s health and well-being director, professor Kevin Fenton, has previously responded to the claims.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Each of the people who smoke through life will die because of tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than the risks of traditional tobacco. However, the long-term impacts need to be examined more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
The UK has nearly 80 000 deaths related to smoking each year, and smoking costs for public health care by £2 billion annually.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current display that electricity cigarettes are not a riskless alternative, but that their harmful effects are a fraction of the detriment of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4
Luke Johnson, headed by Channel 4, has stated that BBC should stop sending certain programs. These include EastEnders and The Voice. Johnson said that commercial competitors would give their right hand on the hits, such as the soap series Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the license fee should only be used for the production of programmes that other television stations do not.
He criticizes the BBC for the promotion of programmes that are likely to be less public at the same time with the major audiences of competitors, and, for example, the BBC4 channel.
After the BBC Director-General Tony Hall announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organizations, Johnson said for six years that he tried to work with Channel 4 with BBC, no results.
“I do not agree with the idea that BBC would buy formats and send programs that would be clearly part of some competing channel software,” Johnson told the Communications Committee of Parliament’s upper room, which revealed the future of BBC.
If BBC wants to keep a broadcasting fee, which is not necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should reduce its supply to at least programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
BBC sends The Voice to the best time of view because it wants the broadest possible support in the future.
If no other channel is concerned about the program, it is clearly ridiculous nonsense.
“I don’t understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could be financed without support,” Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, the EastEnders, the other, even though it is their own production.
A lot of channels would give their right hand about it.
I don't understand how this serves the services of the broadcaster.
I don't think that would be a loss to the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was headed by Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010. He believes that BBC is looking for good viewers because he works in the company with ambitious people and because they believe it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on BBC's most popular series are similar to the former Sky Bomb Tony Ballin, who suggested in 2003 that BBC sells the series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, BBC's niche public programs are shown on the BBC4 channel, where the audience figures cannot mostly be measured, but the programs fulfill their purpose. "BBBC can say in defending his hypocrite missions that made four billion £ of broadcasting fees, yes, special programs that no one looked at."
“BBBC presents them at times when no one will ever see them.”
From broadcasting fees, Johnson said: “I will find you looking for another in that sense as an old-fashioned system that who receives the best benefit.
Of course, everyone thinks that 150 pounds a year is affordable, but people for whom it is a big sum, especially if the BBC is not looked at.”
The former Sky and Channel 5 channel leader David Elstein, who also told his own views in the committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should change its ancient missions to "inform, teach, and entertain".
According to Elstein, BBC’s current offer hardly has educational programs – 1 per cent on TV and 0.1 per cent on radio. He adds that BBC should learn from Australia and Canada’s broadcasting companies and get his mission into a new faith: “Inform, light and entertain.”
In the cooperation question, Elstein suggests that BBC could increase broadcasts such as events, such as the Proms Festival, which was sent only a fraction of the concerts last year. “BBBC should also join allies with commercial channels to ensure that the entire supply is available online,” he continues.
The brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttle can change its direction when they are targeted with ultrasonic.
Researchers have grown worms whose nervous system has been genetically modified, so worms can be controlled by ultrasonic.
Small shuttles change their directions when they are targeted with ultrasonic frequency above the hearing area of the ear.
Audio waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified in such a way that they have a transport film that reacts to ultrasonic.
More about: Researchers are following brain activity through light
According to researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics). The method of ultrasonic is used to activate brain, heart and muscle cells by an irritation from outside the body.
California La Jolla sijaitseva Salk Instute researcher Sreekanth Chalasani told Guardian that one day the method can replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). Treatment of DBS is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s symptoms, in which the brain is stimulated by electroimpulses.
The worms usually do not respond to ultrasonic. Chalasani noticed that worms begin to react when they are placed on a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles strengthen ultrasonic waves that move in the worms.
Strengthened ultrasonic waves affect TRP4 ionic acids, which are part of the worm cell films.
According to the article published in Nature Communications, the sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate cells to which they are attached.
In order to control shuttles with ultrasonic Chalasani transformed the worms genetically so that some of their movement-driven nerves appeared in TRP4 ion channels.
When converted to worms were controlled by ultrasonic, microbubbles reinforced sound waves and moved to worms, when the nerve cell left the signal.
The method reminds us of a bit of optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that enables researchers to activate nerve cells using light.
According to Chalasan, sonogenetics, however, have certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
Light is directed to the brain targeted by light fibres, and low-speed ultrasonic ultrasonics, instead, easily pass the cell, so ultrasonic can be directed to the brain through the skull.
“We believe that gene therapy and viral treatment can instantly precipitate human nerve cells to ultrasonic signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments,” Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture tools – your home door!
Advertising is a shame for the British Armed Store
Look at Amnesty International's anti-armed show.
Horrible killer missiles!
Shoes-breaking legs!
Bounty bombs!
Distance mats that cause unbearable pain but do not leave traces!
The happy voice and drawings clearly reveal that this advertising of the world's largest armed fairs is a parodia. The video is produced by Amnesty International, and it is intended to highlight the British government's efforts to sell weapons to the repressive governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) exhibition held at the ExCel Fair Center in London Docklands.
More about: DSEI arms fairs: authoritarian administrations arrive in London
For bus stops and metro stations there are also posters that require a second look.
"Essential notice: are you moving on the metro from 15 to 18 September?" The notification reminds you of the appearance of the London metro announcements. The Metroline’s distance from the other side has a picture of the tanker.
"In September, a number of armed traders arrive at Docklands, and customers are being asked to help to stop the armed trade."
Three hundred publishers have been made by artists who have worked in the Museum of Cruel Designs of Banksyn Dismaland.
A collector named Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters around London with six pounds of "hacking packages of advertising" with six keys that claim to be accessed to about a third of the world bus stations advertisers.
Transport for London is not laughing.
One of the Special Patrol Group compilations.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and Essex University lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists have started to question things and want to bring their political work to the public to see outside the galleries.
Artists have found that social influence through art requires art to be brought into the real world, and many are moving to work with the activists of protesters.
One of the anti-arm trafficking posters welcomes public transport users in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been watched over 100 000 times a day via Facebook. It has been designed without compensation by the Advertising Office VCCP, and both the graphic designer and times have done its work without compensation.
VCCP's artistic leader Matt Lever was devastating the absence of the messmaino and an empty encounter at the ExCeL event calendar. He said, "Let them have a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to exhaust a more realistic, blurred business video, but bright colors and animations make it better."
"They've done great work and helped us raise the messes in which illegal torture equipment trade is carried out," says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
“Then the government must take action and ensure that torture tools are not illegally traded at our home door.”
However, the most creative anties of the weapons fairs may be displayed in the exhibition spaces in ExCeL, where the samplers take advantage of the excellent circular expressions of their trade.
In the press release, Saab announced the order made by the U.S. Army concerning "the portable AT4CS RS".
The product includes "a specially shaped fighter that effectively penetrates directly to the target."
It doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Student Houses
I moved to the student apartment 11 years ago. I was innocent 19 years old and still believed in barets and moral relativism. I just remember the people's smiles I was irritating and countless, long complaints from others.
The most important teachings can be drawn into eight simple rules.
Migration into the apartment is the most difficult experience and the worst is shocking.
In the situation, you will easily start chasing: you will tell everyone what you are, did you like the interim year and why you don’t like Corbyn, and why you don’t “hate or love Marmite, because it’s just yeast, hahhaha, I’m in my room.”
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask other things.
Questioning guides the conversation and helps you find people you like and people you wouldn’t talk to even when your lashes were in the lights and these people would share the detonators.
Give me room for the others.
The rooms often work as drinking dishes, movie theatres and general residence facilities, but their own room is also a place to wear, from underwear.
More about: Don’t even imagine combining dating and university studies
For Introverts, the University is a hard place
However, many apartments have a social culture in which they walk from the room to another and form a lifelong friendship relationship.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I used by dating you."
Try to see if one of your students has exhausted from social interactions. Perhaps it is worth not to knock on the door and send a textbook instead.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
My student apartment had a guy who thought the unlocked door meant that he was welcomed in.
He saw everything.
Get friends by baking.
You will start your study properly when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem to be a 50-century, a little strange case: "Good to the neighborhood, I baked you something small. Smile when I'm curious about your personalities."
Homemade deliciouss are a great way to get new friends.
Your student's friends have to talk to you. Thanks to a tasteful surprise, they can stay a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires reasonable bakery skills.
If you serve unhappy cookers from flour, sugar and fat, others probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Food whispering is also a common fault in student apartments.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can it be taken from someone else's milk store?
Always make sure the owner of the milk store.
You will probably get permission, even though the quote of milk is also the owner of your luggage.
I understand very well that it is annoying if someone whispers something from you. Still try to deal with the situation as adultly as possible – unlike my own student friend, who dragged the washing agent into his milk for punishment for milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Do not noise when others try to sleep or punch.
Not just because it's polite, but it's also worth remembering that everyone else digs.
In my own apartment, a girl asked the next room resident to adjust the music to the lower, for it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbour just increased the volume.
When I finally shut up in the neighbour's room, she let the neighbor sleep for two hours. She left for three hours for a exam, left music in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would move to the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought your student mate would be your future spouse, you'd start dating, divorced, and you'd have to see him every day and lose the right to meet your friends?
Of course, the heart wants what he wants. If the student's partner is definitely not the only one, try to control him.
If you notice at the moment that someone has forgotten their keys in a room whose door is not locked, the limit for chapping and bullying is more disgusting than you could think.
A good joke is fun, but one that's recovering in a moment.
Hidden some object can be a valuable and fun teaching, but no one's room should be confused with toothpaste and sampoo.
The door of the second room can be locked and squeezed in a waterglasse that is placed in a freezer, but do not attach any items to the roof on the blue bar for a couple of times more.
A racist attack for foreign students at the place of residence on Kite - The house planned for the reception centre was swept in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out in Kite, North Karelia.
Unlike the police previously said, this is not the accommodation of underage asylum seekers, but the sleep spaces of foreign students who have already stayed in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, the teacher of the Kite Evankelical University of Kite.
The windows and walls of the National College were swept with racist signs, such as hakarists, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the properties, says the Eastern Finland Police.
According to Luukkainen, a youth-guarantee training in the National University, the building was estimated to be 10 people at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some could be elsewhere,” says Ludwig.
The University has accommodations for people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All people in the building have a-statutes.
Some students study in adult primary school, part of professional studies and part of studying Finnish,” Luukkainen says.
The A status is a so-called ‘continuous residence permit’, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner already present in Finland for a while.
The Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an injuries and a violation of home peace.
According to a number of students, the event was held to students on Monday, an information conference where there were also the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one wanted to leave.
We've had foreign students for decades, and this is the first time something like this happens," says Ludwig.
A lot of people say the messes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
They were suspected to be at least three men and had been on a light passenger car.
I think this is a headache for the weekend of the young people when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Ludwig says.
There is also a hospital in Salo, which has been designed for the reception center.
The case happened last week.
MTV told me about it on his website Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was drawn by a hakaristi and written in English "You are not welcome".
The case has been reported to the police.
Description of 15 September at 16.02 Repaired by the police of incorrect information about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will terminate the Y train to Karjaa - the passengers in their chews, "the idiots"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepor will cease to pass in March.
The news inspired passengers at the Helsinki Main Railway Station at the beginning of the train.
In particular, the downtime strikes the Siuntiolas, said Torbjörn Bengtström.
It is idiotic because the population is growing all the time and the workforce needs a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
It can't be anything but political will or its lack.
Bengtström says HSTV's interview video will come to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also happening elsewhere in New Zealand.
On the main track, H and R trains are combined with a new R line.
Purola Station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR disclosed information on which routes the Ministry will buy train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period will change in the year-to-year period and the routes to be suspended are in the whole country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in the autumn, will be subsequently adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Siuntian Bengtström believes that the state train cutter is a short-sighted operation.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there's a regret.
The Y train is also used by non-raceporians and civilians because it is quick and overlooks several stations.
Espoo's Annina Pöyrya was harmed by the fate of travelling far from the city area.
“It’s especially bad for those who have to plan their journey again,” he said when he hurts his Y train.
Small relief is promised.
There is a new train connection to the beachfront that will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Seaway (HSL) area, which will lead to Kirkkonumme.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. practically for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now starting to figure out different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
The costs are still impossible to accurately assess.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars per year of the Y train, of course, the Ministry has paid much more than that.
The R line on the main track will miss two positions.
Instead, the number of trains in Ainola and Sauna Kallio will double.
The whole country ceases to have 28 small positions and numerous routes.
The minister will no longer buy train transport from routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to the route Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train shifts decrease on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips a year will be made with a break-off shift, with a total of nine million passengers on the transport purchased by the minister.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the state.
The value of the agreement is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote the chapter on the topic of capital: "It's worth studying with Marx."
The World Economic Crisis has raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and its final work published in 1867-1894, writes the topic of the capital of Marx, known as former President of the GDP, in the book published today.
"He is now taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen wrote in his premiere.
Marx’s estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, the internationalisation and the invasion of all the areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have shown to be astonishingly remote.
The list of authors of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase also includes Professor of the University of Aalto, a respected economic player of Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx’s current “day and forever.”
But isn't the former CEO of the Institute of Economics and Economics, however, a Marxian?
Not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theoretical.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economic scientist, journalist, political agitator and literature lessons.
“The fact is that the history of the dead men tells of false opinions,” Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s predictions went badly.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions on the beginning of capitalism, Korkman will consider.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx’s radical installation.
"The most reliant thing in Marx is that he asked good questions," he said.
Now again, we are discussing the interests of Marx, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to the person who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of the technical implication," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not helpful for Marx.
He thinks capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
But Marx is worth studying with Korkman.
"In the 1970s, Marx couldn't read," Korkman said.
"The Romans and Trorchs and other sects hated all capitalism, but more and more each other."
Today, the debate is more versatile, and Marxia can be approached without the ideal and political weight load of the years back.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx's thought world, just like other classics," Korkman says.
The United Nations demands war criminals in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the Civil War of Sri Lanka, the news agency AFP says.
The UN report on the Civil War in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames both the armed forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels known as Tamilites.
The Civil War in Sri Lanka is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There is no accurate information about the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack of the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be investigated properly, the UN report requires.
The Sri Lanka Armed Forces report blames for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, whose victims were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have committed to forced side-by-side and children into fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it would arrange the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
The yo test of England was used to puntarize social media
In the autumn student’s writings there was a long foreign language on Wednesday, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 experiments were tested in England.
In the experiment, it could be written about social media.
Based on our own experience, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the text of the 150-250 word in English could be shown to the consultant of the web magazine.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is in charge of Finnish Leelia's rest chair.
He was asked how parents could look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects to choose one.
"It was the hardest of them," wrote the third topic of Porvoo's Swedish high school writer Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was only a sitate from former President Jose Manuel Barroso.
According to Lybeck, the fourth topic was very nice.
It had to write a fire speech why businesses should hire young people to work.
"We have been practicing writing speeches at least in our school," Lybeck says and estimates the whole test "all normal".
In the Finnish - or Swedish - English experiment, it was possible to answer the questions of texts, such as the adaptation of summer collar to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52), and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn writings will continue on Friday, when another domestic, Swedish or Finnish test is underway.
The test is normally conducted in the schools, i.e. the demonstration of the employees does not affect it.
The college degree board invites the exams to look for appropriate connections in time to get to the trial event.
You can also get more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own neglect.
Oulu has been robbed with a gun.
On Wednesday morning, Oulu was robbed in the city of Kello.
According to the police, the robber had dressed in dark clothes and his face was covered in a commando poem.
He's a normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a gun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating it as a brutal robbery.
Police are waiting for ten-century demonstrators to arrive in Helsinki - support teams from elsewhere in Finland
The demonstration against the government's surgery decisions will be blocked by the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to pre-information, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, the Open and STTK Association will meet at the Railway Market at 11:00.
Police are also believed to participate in demonstration.
On the other hand, the job of the police is not only to carry out alarms and other police activities, but also to ensure that the giant expression is smooth.
The roads leading to the railway track will be closed from motor vehicles for a period from 9.30 to 14.
Only alarm vehicles will be released to the area.
From Hakanieme's direction, the transport is cut off from Kaisaniem's traffic circle, from the west from Mannerheim.
Is there enough people in the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least so far, it seems that enough.
I don't take a position on the police's work fight.
As a result of the demonstration, the support teams from Finland are coming to Helsinki.
The exact patrols don't tell the police.
“Something is coming, but, in general, we can do it on our own,” Kujala says.
The police are asking to avoid private cargo in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic bag extends from the Hakaniemi level to its core center.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the night.
With demonstrators from elsewhere in Finland, many order buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They will not be released to the Railway.
The buses will leave time to go.
Then the rest of the journey should go to the demonstration site,” Kujala says.
The expression also stops the Helsinki public transport.
From the point of view of the police, there is also a positive side.
The problem of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally in the hands of these large gatherings, will now be dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the statement have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to go peacefully.
There are people who are normal working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
The Finns are reasonable and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
On Friday, local demonstrations are also held across Finland.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The great demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good reference in Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä, Emeritus Martti Siisiäinen.
It is not a wonder that the Ay movement protests.
If it didn’t, it would lift your hands up in front of the government, the cool says.
The very right-wing government has hit the Finnish Corporatism tradition in the core points - and also in the areas that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government’s hard shots are lacking in contract law.
Here are a lot of features that the Ay movement is actually trying to get on their knees.
The Ay movement also has a place to look into the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have any support for all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
The new is now the steep division that the demonstration will bring about amongst the people that the ay movement would want to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed across Finland showed their views at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday’s demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostorstai, organised in 1993, says.
In the middle of the deepest lama organized by Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (Central) government compromised from the labour market crisis to another.
It was said that among the Finnish government and wageholders’ organizations had never been as bad as during the Aho porvarian government.
Now, the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murrostorst.
In addition, there is now a very bourgeois government in Finland ever, the cool says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict right in spite of the words of the Finnishs.
At the time of the ramp, there were certain elements of the old workforce movement.
There are a number of thousands of protesters on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day homes and schools.
Even though the demonstration does not receive undistributed support for wagers, it can become the largest for years.
In Helsinki, around 300 demonstrations have been held annually in recent years.
There's a lot of them.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish Ay movement have been quite calm - even though the practices have been tightening in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, being lawful.
The protesters are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property,” the cool says.
The end of the 1990s, however, brought new winds.
Contemporary culture changed.
The EU membership annoyed farmers to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get on pig shit.
The firemen strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes, including pilots and airline drivers.
Do you remember these strikes and protests?
The 1970s metal and electrical strikes
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electrical strike in 1977.
There were 70,000 metal men involved in the strike of metal men.
The strike was suspended by the reconciliation committee for seven weeks after the strike took place.
Metal men received a 16% wage increase.
In the spring of 1977, the electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused electricity breaks all over the country.
Murrostorstas in 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20,000 people, many people who were unemployed, met with the House of Parliament on 4 November 1993 to show their opinion on the behalf of the work.
Firemen striked three months in 1998
The strike of firemen was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
The police were exposed to chicken eggs in the protest of farmers against the EU in 1994.
“Siperia teaches, the EU stops,” one of the attacks.
Espale’s farmers smashed snow by tons.
In 1999, the Helsinki EU Summit also led farmers to protest and burn heinäpots in front of the meeting.
Nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
The nurses striked for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been in a strike in 1983.
A few cases of death during the strike were coloured during the 1995 strike.
Factory threatened to strike and nurses with mass withdrawals in 2007.
In the end, the threat of disintegration has accelerated the negotiations to the outcome.
Doctors striked 2001
"The Doctors at the strike - from the escape," was the attack of strikeing doctors in 2001.
The strike of local health centres and hospital doctors lasted for five months and brought an intense debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctor wages.
Students moving in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for study support from the Senate to the Parliamentary House in Helsinki in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police will find out the backgrounds of the Finnish truck full of refugees for the Austrian police
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to investigate the backgrounds of the refugee registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border, with 42 refugees on board.
There is no way to know if the truck was on its way to Finland.
All the cold trucks were in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility is at the venue in Austria, says Chief Commissioner Tero Haapala of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in Austria were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by choking.
According to the general broadcast, the truck belongs to the Finnish shareholder company, which first told the Austrian police.
The company is engaged in restaurant activities, and its CEO is a foreign-aged, about 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two of the Irish people have been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
Refugee captain, former drug abuser and brutal businessman - story of five smugglers
Upporikas smuggler king, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a good-minded taxi driver.
For example, such people carry human traffic in the European Union.
The Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola at Trento University and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed ten smugglers and their "asians", and their book Death Travel Office will appear in Finland this week.
In the book, they present smugglers of human smuggling, present solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them right away.
There are no attractions of foreign tourists on the eastern coast of Tunisia, but many Tunisians are heading to the summer holiday.
On behalf of its location, islands also fit for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa belonging to Italy is only 120 kilometres.
Due to comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, a chain of burning captain and the father of six children.
The islands are famous for their shrimp but the fishermen are more profitable to transport people.
That's what Emir has done with a blue, ten-metre wooden boat for hundreds of times.
If the boat fills up, it can accommodate 40 people.
With one trip, Emir will make about €8,000 after the cost.
Emir has five assistants looking for customers around Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arabian period a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape from restlessness.
After that, the situation calmed down until it revived with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir accommodations them in empty houses for as long as he sees good.
The food is given so that the customers are just and just staying alive.
The property costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer loses the money, it's their problem.
We're going to go to the water at midnight at the fastest detonated.
The first night is driven away from the island, then stop, wait a day, and drive to the next night to Lampedus.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and passengers cry and vomit in 20 metres of waves.
In the destination, the human cargo has been dismantled in half an hour and Emir is leaving for a return trip.
Emir wants him to be afraid.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims to beat the speakers alive.
He says in the book that once the police assaulted him, he threw all his passengers across the border and told them to swim on the nearest island.
“I was one by one of my clients and thrown them over the edge,” Emir says.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
He says his countrymen have to assault this.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge.
A normal taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða in Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the starter engine is running their last, and anyway it's seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi is moving and moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to southwest.
The centre of asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly allowed.
Men travelling in the forests surrounding the center without their family will stay in tents, campuses and abandoned cars, which now anyone has managed to find or build.
In the forest, families who have not submitted asylum applications to Serbia for reasons or others.
Some also stay in private housing, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weekend walks in a heavy-duty landscape, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When finally arrives in Bogovaða, a large human smuggling node, people are fatigue.
Goran’s riders are mainly Syrian, Afghanistan, Pakistani, Iraqi, and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran says.
According to him, Africans are trying to do a tink.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
Stupid fools all the way.
At first, for example, 300 euros will be agreed, then they will drop it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran underlines being a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than anyone else, and he bills only EUR 50 per person from the Hungarian border.
It has a trip of one hundred kilometers, most of which are comfortable on the motorway.
My colleagues say they're asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a big amount for the smuggler, but it is quite a nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered taxis not to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care about it: he knows the roads and the short paths and takes his riders a mile away from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and shook away.
The Work of the Prayer
A 35-year-old congo-man is called Ambassador, and it is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant Church in Uganda in Kampala, a large number of refugees from Congo, as well as a small centre to help congo children refugees.
In addition to preaching, ambassador runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the ambassador to look good.
He polishs his shoes several times a day and ensures that the rubber tape of white underwear stylishly under the low belt of the jeans.
Ambassador is proud of his new Mercedes, his terrain car and three motorcycles.
When the Ambassador does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forwards to Europe.
At first, the customer calls to one of the five phone numbers of the Embassy.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money viciously and blew it in the midst of traders crossing the border.
In order to obtain a asylum seeker or refugee status, Uganda’s authorities must be told that it is from North Kivu’s war areas, for example, and that they have been forced to escape from their homes of violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary will arrange a new identity for the customer.
An old identity certificate will be removed and another will be acquired.
It helps the contacts of the Ambassador in the Uganda Police.
After that, the client will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum application procedure, the NGOs, finally the UNHCR of the UNHCR.
Ambassador knows bureaucracy because he has become a refugee in Uganda.
He bills separately from each gate: submission of an application to Uganda police costs about EUR 100, managing documents to a humanitarian organisation about 150 and a migration process, for example, EUR 4 500-7 000 in a European country.
Foliota and ice flames
Tom is a beginner smuggler, former drug abuser.
Fourty-five Irish custody on the French coast at Calais, where his job is to load people on cargo to the UK.
He has an Afghanistanian, French taxi driver and dozens of trucks who may not even know he is in the human traffic business.
During the night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere from the Calais Center.
They drive motorway A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would be in jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want, he's been sitting for seven years.
Taxi stops, Tom runs over his customers' motorways to a resting place where drivers sleep before they continue to cross the channel to British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - it must be ensured that it's on his way to England, and not even the Netherlands, and cut off the safety wizard.
It needs to be done quietly so that the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in the aluminum foil, the same thing that is wrapped around the cook or oven potato.
It should prevent the police's heat scanner from detecting the hiding person.
Some use the bedroom bags filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the place, hoping that the driver is not a quick flasher before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
Upporica Turkish has been called the Master of Marketing and the undisputed king of the Mediterranean's unlawful land rises, dominating sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage for other entrepreneurs: he only demands money.
One of the new methods is a luxury shippetition: Turkish ports are rented for villas to take Americans or European families for a few days of tourists.
In fact, ships will be loaded in full by Syrian, Iraqi, Kurdish and Afghanistan, which will be transported against a fee of EUR 5 000-7 000 from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe.
Customers are stored in human stocks, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are storing into minibuses and driving somewhere around the coast.
They are told to hide amongst the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under the deck.
The Maritime Guard can only observe the depth of the boat swimming, for other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers stool and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about 53,000 euros from one luxury ship trip after the cost.
He does not take practical care of himself, but hire captains, recruiters, guards, accommodations and other smaller factors to take care of the work for himself.
During the summer period, shipments are held at least hundreds and Küçük earns millions.
He is believed to have purchased undercover companies through the country, the pharmaceutical company and more than 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
After that, he's probably gone.
Correction on 16 September 5 at 15.10: The Death Travel Office will be published this week, not next week.
The American Olympic Joker tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book called Fast Girl, tells us about the ending of his career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published breaks from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career for Sydney's Olympics.
He came to the races in the top and ran in the cartoons for the second best time.
In the final, he was panicked.
He drove to the top immediately at the beginning and defended his leadership on the ground run.
However, 150 meters before the goal, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed into the surface of the track, and other competitors passed him by one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the goal line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later, Favor Hamilton suffered two-way mood disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney’s races, and he himself felt huge pressures on success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple did not have any economic problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strangers.
He also spoke to his husband to accept his action.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was EUR 450 per hour.
He says he used the money for a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations in becoming prostituted was also that he needed similar adrenaline spikes as he had been competing in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had two-way mood disorder.
The double life of the former star driver came out at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun published a article.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was at 1500 metres of the world’s statistical community at 3.57.40, but remained the last of Sydney’s Olympics.
The world champion was delighted when the union put the Norwegian skiing coupon in control: "The Strawberry"
The Norwegian skiing king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of fitness in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian Skiing Union have twisted the entire summer and autumn, as last year, the athlete agreement.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for a multiplicated world champion and Olympic winner.
The result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian Skiing Association decided to close Northug out of the World Cup of the coming season.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the union ran the skier.
"Thank you for showing the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union,” he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Skiing Union and Northug is about money.
Northug would probably like to be part of the seasonal team so that he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent the union, which also cares for future generations, and does not give one athlete’s solos.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because it is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own newsletter in which he said he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colors in the next season in the World Cup as well as after the MMs and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MM medals in his career, two of which were gold.

The shielding day of the paste translators is also spent in the Nordic country.
On the day of shielding, 25.9., tricks are held in various restaurants and shops that have been granted the Paist Translators' shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight the high level of food skills in Finland and to lower the threshold of departure to the restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the balloon as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have focused on the capital area, but the top restaurants audited and classified by an impartial operator are found around Finland.
The international attention given to the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of the enhancement of the awareness of thyroid foods and organization.
In the Nordic country, the day will be held in the Vaasa restaurant in Fondiks and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town restaurant is participating in the shield day.
The event has also gained significant international attention.
The event has been decided to make one of the most important international events of the organization that are held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki Magazine: The establishment of a Disastrous reception centre for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are in collaboration with the establishment of the Refugee reception centre in the premises of the Ex-space of Kauhava, currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region still has a critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, namely the Finnish Erillisverkot Oy.
The Kauhajoki magazine says that the establishment of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant risk of safety that has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the Defense Forces may have interest in the former Air War School region and airport, which has no effect on the preparation of the reception centre, writes the newspaper.
The case states that, for the last two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistön (ps.) and Head of State of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädy.
A private person notes to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a question of the principle of objection of the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former reserve area is wrong.
The terrible city government dealt with the reception centre last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The government means that there are the necessary conditions for immigrants and those who are here, Niinistö commented on journalists in the evening after meeting the presidents of all the parliamentary parties in their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern of the management of the refugee situation was combined with all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to the situation in Syria and the activities of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation of Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
Societies are hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia are able to do so, it has an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the still tension of the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to that, the NATO issue was also ignored in the discussions.
The president did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Media Researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipila, the communication requires diverse channels, and the Prime Minister's TV and radio calls are one of the channels among others.
This channel of direct speech is also needed in the future.
This will not remain the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in the Parliament.
Sipila did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister’s TV and radio talks are going to be repeated.
According to Sipila, speeches may not always be communicated in the Yle channels.
If other channels are registered as channels, then let's see.
Now, this channel is used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipila, the state of Finland’s economy is so serious that it requires the public to keep a television and radio call.
This set of things we are talking about is quite complex and requires a further explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel.
The speech will be sent from 21.05-21.20 in both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
It can also be seen in Yle Areena.
Sipila Takes a Big Risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipila’s TV talk does not tell the general government about turning in.
Is it an effort to take the definition of the public debate more strictly into its hands and refuse to discuss questions at the University of Stockholm?
It reminds the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin’s recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things do not relate to each other.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is upset by the announcement of Sipila.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
Political decision-makers’ communications styles are not about democracy.
The role of media representatives is to make a clear effort not to be taken by politicians.
According to Koivus, TV talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipila should bring something new and special into the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations for the speech.
Is there more to offer today what we have already heard?
Or can he speak in a different way, differently or differently, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, you need to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
Ylekin is taking this risk in this regard if it is not a particular situation but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be stamped as a messenger of politicians or parliament and government, which will certainly not be in line with the interests or general line.
Squirrel squirrel
In the future speech of Sipila, it is also important that what the Prime Minister does not say, the media researcher stresses.
Tonight, we need to look carefully at where Sipilä is missing and where not, says Jyväskylä University Research Coordinator Heikki Kuutti.
According to the Cube, the TV speech is a doorstep bet from Sipila, because this makes it possible to bring out its own view without a sora sound.
This will give the public a message without a journalist filter, unlike the press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipila passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media interprets something wrong about the speech because the specific questions are not allowed.
Six says it’s very important how Sipila occurs on TV, the sweat of sweating, whether your hands are shaking.
He compares Sipila to the father who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä is able to play his business well, it can work.
The situation is different than when the government informs about something, because this person is talking directly to another person.
This is what (US President Barack) Obama and partners regularly practice.
Very extraordinary
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the speech of the Prime Minister to be very exceptional to the citizens.
He said it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would like to congratulate Finns on the extortions ahead.
On Friday, wageholder organisations organise demonstrations and strikes against government actions.
President Paavo Arhinmäki, on Twitter, said that Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
The SDP President, Antti Rinne (sd.), once again, announces its challenge for Sipila's dialogue.
There is no time for monologs.
About half a year from the elections.
In the end, you cannot hide, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a escape trip has been found in Tampere
At the time the boy was found, he was fine.
The boy’s father updated his Facebook page.
The Internal Finland Police Department also confirms the case for the evening newspaper.
The boy left to play out at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks everyone who helped me look for them.
Thank you for these ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time
The Finnish UFC star disappointed in the violent wildness of young people: You can cause hatred
Makwan Amirkhani released a video on Facebook, in which he particularly appeals to young immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani had a serious speech against the street fights of young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived five years old with his family, has won both their professional match in the most respected UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me he received a message in which he was asked to look at one of the Instagram accounts.
The account has been downloaded with videos where young people fight with extreme violent patterns.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed in the wildness of young people.
Amirkhan, aged 26, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the people on the ground, sit on the other one and beat the eyelessly without thinking of any of these consequences, what this is going to happen when you make videos like this, Amircani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people displayed on videos are immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinose, social media fight videos have been downloaded by both immigrants and Finnish young people.
The fact is that you're fighting their top street.
You make the life of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds me.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite a lot.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be a long time of guests here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, says Amirkhani.
Amircani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they are sometimes subject to racism, you will be charged with it.
Think about it a few times before you go with me, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action will make a contribution to racism.
You'll get anger in me that I don't like myself.
You have things bad anyway, and you won't cure them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, on Twitter, says that the wageholder organization will consider its position on Monday on the alternative savings list presented by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK's proposal on Twitter.
The STTK previously told the government to present its own proposal on Wednesday, in order to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
Mr Sture Fjäder believes that the government will accept the proposal if the SAK, STTK and the Opening Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest wageholder organisation to soften its previous position.
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented poorly on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this issue on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that the position of forced laws requires agreements made by active parties.
Lyly reminds the Prime Minister Sipila’s Government’s proposal for a social agreement was not suitable for the SAK.
Sipilä had previously interrupted the negotiation of the social agreement when the SAK refused to commit to the target of the 5% productivity phase.
Comments on: The great opinion threatens to shine - "It feels a little funny to puke a fist"
It feels a little funny to wear a fist, if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, write Pekka Tiinanen.
The emotions vary from the edge in the payer camp.
Are you supposed to be shouting the government or agreeing with it?
On Monday, the SAK federal leaders revolted on holy hatred against the Government of the Republic.
The whole country was threatened to catch.
The threat also spread to the adventures.
The teachers’ professional organization, OAJ, threatened to close schools and daycare.
On Tuesday, OAJ canceled: no school or daycare is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STTK, appeared in a coordinated manner.
He said he kept in touch with the government and produced an alternative presentation required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) as a 5% productivity scene.
President Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately announced that his accord paper is already ready.
At first, the SAK office didn’t have anything to do with it.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the federal leaders just ordered the country to stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to address the situation and that the SAK will look for solutions to open the labour market lock.
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should tend to accept a 5% productivity gap as a target.
There is no wonder that the STTK of Palola has relations with the government of Sipila.
The right hand of the fire, director Jukka Ideus of the STTK, was formerly the special support of Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinieme.
The fire described that the government's ay skills have been improved all the time.
It was a case or not, but the output of the Palola took a little clean off from the Finnish standers, whose rolling picture is the wedding of the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
It feels a little funny to wear a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited at 18:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again."
Russian Duma President Sergei Naryshkin criticized the OSCE meeting.
The Russian Duma President, Sergei Naryshkin, believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the presidential session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, in which Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July Helsinki celebration meeting.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced on the European Union, to come to the meeting - a matter from which the President resembled journalists.
According to our assessment, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed the news office according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was not only for Finland and the EU, but for the United States, where his access was also blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation became complicated, so Naryshkin continued to blink Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for the "special organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly will proceed constructively and positively - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there are no obstacles to parliamentary dialogues.
Naryshkin has met the Ilkka Kanerva (kok), leading to the meeting in Ula Bator, who has already been discussing Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Makes tight"
Tappara and Lukko continue in the Hakamets today for bull days when both are fired on the second day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today, in the Hakamets, there is no real goal celebration.
The killer went to Kuopio last night to scout 3-2 consecutive wins from Kalpa.
The rise was male, for the last season the silver group was the worst of the two goals of the defeat position.
Tuesday, the lock was more brilliant.
As a guest of Blues, the Raumans’ catch was round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any of you play the same game as last year, Lukko-higher Janne Lahti predicts the settings of the club on the pages.
The killing has become a pretty playoff nightmare for the rubbish.
In fact, in the last two years, Tappara has just dropped out of the Lock's final series.
Both layers require a decisive seventh mat.
During the last season, Lukko took the series off in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three sides and over.
There are no major changes in group compositions except target guards.
The two of us who opposed yesterday will have a skateboard shift today.
On the goal of the killing, Mika Noronen will make room for Tomi Karhuse, and between the Lukko-tolps, Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolsk.
View angle: A miserable play in the autumn runs
Hopela, the sports director, handwriting a non-compliant post to the main coach of Rautakalli, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone scripted a Rocky movie where he himself played the main part.
The subordinate sent to the campus for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky gained great sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
After thirty years of Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola scripted a restless Tuhkimo story in Pori.
Anonymous and wood-handed batteries progressed to everyone’s astonishing SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of nominal, but firm subordinates like Rocky.
It was white Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, players colored their heads red and cut the irocesis.
Hope became a blonde.
JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
The ace took the winning silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The author Hopela believes that this season’s news works work the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director has built a devil for the evil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been ruining a bunch of rocky pig carrots at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in some other way than in a stunning game.
Hopela has forgotten that the main part of Rocky VI is Pekka Rautatalio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Rautakallion Sean Connery.
Rautahallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original 1976.
There's nothing else in the iron cliff than Rocky's nickname.
The game philosophy of Rautakallion does not include assaulting and squirting.
He appreciates a hard game, but it is different to play hard than a pig.
During the last season, the Essien Garret Stafford took the Tapparan Jere Karjala's head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve.
I do not accept such a game, and it belongs to the ace hockey, and Rautakallio, who went hot after the game, woke up to the people of the Satakunta.
This season's team has been strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, cops and emitters.
There are no key players in the best game age.
No wonder the main coach complained about the lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence players’ projects, Pekka Rautahallio?
Last season’s events affect the acquisitions and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite limited, Rautakallio responded diplomaticly.
Under the surface, he's in touch.
The yearly model of 1953 Rautakalio is known to be interested in moving to Hopela’s position as a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in spring.
The balance of the chess in the three leagues of the season has the same number of losses with the goal gap of 1-6.
Hopelan wouldn't have been able to handwritten a further part.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa Claus's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met his husband as Tuuka a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time in the direction of his husband.
Yeah, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, an actress, and the producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulannan’s ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has worked a lot together before, but now Olga plays the first time in the direction of Tuuka.
The role of Olga in the early years of Apulanna, you made us a beautiful film, is a drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother, Sirkka.
Clever twists and supports his son, even though this father Risto (which is presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be a sound of sense.
The more I’ve seen my real example in Sirka, the easier it feels to play a role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka that he trusted me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but then the two have a lot closer.
They've met, spoken on the phone and communicated.
Circus has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, it is also clear that the drama is a drama and the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga underlines that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Assistant would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 90s, it was lame and very harsh.
There was quite a small probability that someone actually succeeded, but Sirka had some kind of intuition, and he was right.
Olga says he had heard a lot about this youth from Tuuka before the film plans.
However, parents’ stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you're doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different than the evil-remembered Tuuka of Heinola.
Olga was an ark and a nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At least he could have been in love with secretly.
According to Olga, he has worked so much with Tuuka over 10 years that the big joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole production group will go to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in India is often planning to drive home because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole Heinola month.
They have taken us very warmly, asked only what streets and when they will be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive film in Finland
Iron Sky, directed by Timo Vuorensola: The Coming Race, the budget is 17 million euros.
The descriptions begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola starts shooting the Iron Sky 2 film in October Belgium.
The Scifi movie, the Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become the most expensive film in Finland in its budget of €17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animated in progress will also rise after the completion of Iron Sky 2, as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
The films directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukoma begin in October near Antwerp in AED Studios and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola goes to Belgium next week.
The garbage budget is not afraid.
I've been sickly relaxed!
I have a so relaxed script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that they are doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and I can't wait to show this movie to the public, he's gonna tell the newspaper.
Initially, the budget for the film was 8-10 million, but the budget also increased when the script was developed.
The budget is big, but there's a big stoor.
However, 100 million people would be stuck in the movie because each angle and efficiency are so expensive.
Now everything is so tight that there is no looseness.
Today, Iron Sky Universe launched a mass funding campaign and a bond of 4-8% annual interest.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Is it cool or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters’ breasts have recently decorated large logos.
Even some time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and large logos like Crocs in a console.
The advertising of a t-shirt or a t-shirt was somewhat seen as a junt.
Times change.
Sports has become the right fashion megatrend, and also old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike have risen to coolness waveharja.
And as often before, the funny and trendy boundary is shy: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came a standard core trend, i.e. a tavis fashion, where trenders surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothes as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a grey basic college, it is already in the bottom of the cabinet that has been buried in the sleeves before the manufacturer’s logo comes in.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logs, for example, the tracks identified by Adidas, the favorite team's shirts and the New York Yankees tickets have made a return to the street fashion.
The farch edge begins to scratch Calvin Klein logos is now a cool detail.
Trendi seems to be moving from sports to luxury brands.
For example, the chest of Versace's syspusers makes it clear what a sign of clothing it is.
Would you be ready to introduce logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank!
According to the statements, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to remove large sizes of Zotovia from the tank lock for five hours.
Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, where he seems to squeeze the armor vehicle in quite good moods, and at least on the basis of those images, it’s about catching or madness.
Total foolishness.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, but it was a collision tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served on Ural.
I went in there, looked around me, and I came out in peace, Zotov said the Comosomolskaja Pravda.
I didn’t get stuck, I certainly didn’t spend five hours in that position, he said.
The Russian Army TV channel Zotov explained his enthusiasm in the exhibition of Russia’s new technology because he is a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was curious about what's inside the cars, I inspired our techniques.
And I came out through the back lock, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely go to all tanks and all assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the writer's idiot.
One fool wrote, and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm long and rotating, but nothing that I would be stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba to the radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photograph of alleged congestion has been published, even though there were a total of 50,000 people on the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck began to move on from the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotovin was told about his ribbons when he tried to get out of the tank lock and eventually threatened to shoot all around him unless he gets out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story where the exhibition organisers reported their own views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to the fact that the soldiers jump out of armed vehicles quickly.
But the Popular Representative Zotov, due to his size, simply delayed when he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski Bloknot.

The Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland's Kittilän mine has been bleeding.
The purified process water of gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand to its stream.
According to the company, measures to correct the leakage have begun.
The pool has neutralized enrichment sand and cleaned process water.
Usually, water is pumped either again as process water or led to the environment through the surface area, as authorised.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leakage water meets the current terms of authorisation.
The other material did not flow into the environment.
The bleeding was observed in the inspection round Monday morning.
The leak has not been observed to cause structural damage to the underground fertilizer structures.
The company says that it will work closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred established employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns you not to cut too much
The Finnish country report published by the International Monetary Fund today follows largely the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization swept into structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime compensation and pay-free days would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed throughout the contracting system and unemployment security.
According to the main economicist Pasi Kuoppamäe, the Danske Bank agrees with structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates a lot of communications to the government’s actions, but on the other hand, there are also warning words about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to the Economy Reports.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support poor economic growth.
The IMF estimates that this year Finland will increase by 0.4%, which will increase to 0.9% next year.
Danske predicts that growth will remain zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They could have had the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland said the total production was in small growth in the summer, Kuoppamäki said.
The weakened trust in industry or other so-called softer metrics could have been given less attention.
However, the difference is just a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader.
In July, Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer, worked under Tatsumi Kimishima on Wednesday, told Nintendo on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charistant face in the game industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to a successful Wii console launch.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assessing Ace Research Analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to see that Nintendo is strongly involved in mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency acknowledged that hundreds of children who have arrived in the country will disappear annually.
In particular, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, according to the Swedish Immigration Agency, hundreds of minor applicants disappear annually.
Juha Kannelmaa, CEO of the Immigration Agency, tells us what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear in a year?- In Finland, 156 applications for asylum received alone were made in 2013.
They disappeared nine.
In 2014, the corresponding applications were made 196 and they disappeared 11, Kannelmaa says.
The background of the disappearance may be that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found full-aged there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will be found later when they apply for asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, in Finland there were 3651 asylum seekers, of which 134 applications were made for a revocation decision because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past 123 years, he said.
Is there a number in growth?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 petitions of minors alone.
There is no total statistics on the missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of minor applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing people.
What happens to those who have been converted?
Do they, for example, disappear from the “smooth labour market” market?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Agency, as the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He has taken action on the matter.
At the EU Interior Ministerial Meeting, Orpo, who discussed refugees’ issues, reported on Monday practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see photos of the devices
Due to disease attacks, Timo T.A. Mikkose’s equipment used for television and radio productions have now been sold.
Mikkosen's spouse, Nina Mikkonen, sells Huuto.net devices that were the most advanced professional tools in the industry.
The online announcement was first reported by the website of Iltamakasin.
Today, most of the devices have remained in the legs of technological development.
The digital media world no longer describes television programs for Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested people are found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but they are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitalized.
On the other hand, there are many enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from the current Myrskylä home.
We can't take all the amount of goods with us.
I've started to invent and see where the goods are released.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no use for television and radio devices anymore.
It is clear from the rear acute infarctions that a long career man will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s real life work was archived in the summer of the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other materials from Storm.
Traffic threatens to fade worse than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metron and tram drivers today decide whether they will expand their power in relation to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the time of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be clear if the traffic stops all day.
Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is large on the field.
Night and intermediate cuts are badly brightened by drivers, so the government’s plans to cut the licences are advocating.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams are stationed by Friday, public transport is almost completely stationed in the capital area.
According to the VR, trains do not travel between 6:00 and 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
On Friday, there is no distance and no distance traffic.
The trains left before 6 a.m. will be driven to stations.
According to the HSL data, most of the buses remain on the varieties.
The members of the ACP are gone from work on Friday to 3:00 a.m. on Saturday mornings.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by superpower, and Pirkko Repo, the HSL reporter.
Repo says HSL can’t tell you exactly what bus shifts are going on Friday.
Employee organisations organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Rautatietori on Friday from 11 to 13 pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tears against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tears.
The incident took place at the border of Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to get forward to Europe, says the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water tanks against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas - the teacher thought it was a bomb.
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after the teacher considered his own watch to be a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he only wanted to introduce him to the output of his electronics.
However, one of the teachers thought the watch was like a bomb.
The police were called and the situation ended in the end of the time that the boy was taken into the arrest cell of the young people in handcuffs.
Mohamed has not been found to claim anything but that he had made the clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had seen the watch look like a movie bomb.
The clock is in custody of the police, but it consisted of a circuit board and a digital display between the leaders.
The case occurred last Monday, and Mohamedia was punished by three days of forced leave from school.
His father is angry and the US-Islamic Council wonders whether the case is another example of Islamophobia in the United States.
United Kingdom - The Labour Director refused to sing a national song
In the song God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the monarchy.
Corbyn’s own Labour Party representatives have also joined the opinion of the press that will fall into justice.
This has insulted the people, suspected the labour citizen of Kate Green in the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night, the British Air Force flyers fought against Germany Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses his respect for the airlines by participating in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude for the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood quietly during the national song, highlighted in the opinion.
Corbyn's choice to be a party leader has divided into labour lines.
In particular, there are those who fear he will deport moderate voters with their radical views.
Corby supports unilateral disarmament, ending savings and increasing public spending.
Corbyn is supposed to be the first party leader in the House today at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public about what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron picked up Corbyn on a week-to-week Twitter as a party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister referred to his own account.
The cause of Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the father was waiting for a case of justice.
South Lake Minnetonka Police have been investigating a family death in Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
The five-sex family was found dead in her home on September 10, and a few days later, the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting the first shot at his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this notice, police went to the house for an inspection and found a huge house across the short family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims have been dead for days.
Million House and Successful Company
South Lake Minnetonka's police chief Michael Sitar's case is still under investigation.
The motivation of the networks is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on the social media website of AllNurses.com.
In 2014, the StarTribune interview, Short, said there were four million visitors on the site every week.
For me, 50 purchases have been made over the past ten years.
I have abandoned all of them.
But I still have a lot of ideas I want to do.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the fact that Short’s family bought two million dollars from Greenwood in 2011.
The house is advertised in Zillow as a dream of a car collector: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight cars with enough garage.
The case in progress
According to StarTribune, the father of the family was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep has challenged him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, no comments were removed from Short’s site, and they had therefore lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial had had a significant impact on short business.
Vesku Loiri offered cakes
In addition, the owner-third was awarded at a nutritional event with the Finnish Hippos month horseowner award.
This is a great one, Loiri commented on his charity table.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned $100,000.
The artist legenda Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo’s success in a major competition.
I still don't think it happened.
According to Loir, the coach of successshevose will receive full work peace working with the horse.
Pekka decides and decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut up, Loiri.
The great gesture of the NHL star - "The greatest athlete of all time."
Montreal Canadiens' superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (approximately EUR 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the medical report, this is the largest single donation made by an athlete in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital in another fund collection for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with Canadiens for eight years and 72 million dollars a year ago.
Subban’s donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his nine million dollars.
Subban receives a subway space with its name.
The players of Canadiens have helped local hospitals considerably before.
A year ago, a long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same child hospital and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city’s major hospital to get to the hospital a PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
You can order a wife for tonight - serves food with only bikini and essence on your head
The thematic cafes are a hard thing in Japan.
The market already has a goat cafe, a cannabis cafe, a vampire cafe, a halikahvila, and now a wife cafe.
It hits solitary, social and hunger.
The Metro's news.
The Ore no Yome (Female) coffee shop can order a wife or husband for the evening.
This is a waiter who pretends to be a client's spouse.
"Puoliso" is selected from the list before the coffee shop arrives and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is in front of just a squirt and bikini on her head, and the husband again in a tight biking horses.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the wife’s candidate to what mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: Attacks against the security of cars began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, the Intel published.
The board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising the best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of the best practices of cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB's research results.
The International ICT Research and Consultation Company Gartner estimates that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles are connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish the best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important ingredient in the design of each connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about EUR 52,000 in Finland!
Ford Focus RS has been expected for years to rise as a month.
Finally, the car begins to be in the perspective of Finland.
Ford released the RS data now that the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt car exhibition.
Ford’s new four-two RS is accelerated by its 2.3 liter, 350 horse-powered engine 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and its peak speed is 266 kilometres per hour.
The price is also interesting in Finland, initially it is reported to be EUR 52,000.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when it comes to Finland.
Kia’s favourite brand presented two news in the Frankfurt car exhibition - such is a new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation of Sportage is definitely more important than two innovations in Finland, where Kia intends to catch a larger wing from the growing street landscape market.
The new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, created by Sportage, is more rounder than before.
In the axle range and outskirts, the second inch has come here and the car breaks the air more efficiently.
The engine range is mostly the same, but there is 1,6 liter turbo that develops 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales revenue.
We have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage arrives for us in spring 2016.
Even before the shift of the year, the new Kia Optims came to our country.
Suddenly, the news doesn’t seem to change, but it’s a new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle-class buyers with better driving features, lower noise level and higher-level equipment.
Optims with 1,7 liter turbodiesel and 2,0 liter gasoline engines are received at the beginning.
Next summer, the speed accelerates when they arrive at 2.0 liter turbo engines with Optima GT.
At the same time, with its income, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu returned to the stages - squeezed in a brave shaft
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child Concert with other domestic stars.
The electric pants have a visible, open neck hole.
The apartment is beautifully presenting the singer's belt.
The total size of the crown is golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the mother-in-law singer has been depressed by mild exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year.
The singer released his first single on a new album in August.
Back to the stages and the rise to the public after a long break is not really exciting for me.
I've missed everything about music, the singer says.
Chisu publishes a new album called Polaris after a few weeks.
The new situation of life has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think about it.
Kim Kardashian's motherhood resentment - now she's showing the chest
The true TV beauty of Kim Kardashian gives topics for each other.
She presents her pregnancy waist and breast clothing in sexy clothes, last night at one of America's times when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian's husband Kanye West's show.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the lightning dress.
Last time Kardashian dressed for an amateur motherhood when she visited her friend for dinner in New York just a few days ago.
The black over-generation boots highlighted the point.
The third special maternity suit is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when the show was in pregnancy.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you are lonely, competition is terrible
Manon Leloup wanted to understand that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne celebrations.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls (Puhuvat Dolls), where Leloup and his colleagues talk about pure modeling business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine assembled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins with nothing.
Even if during the previous period you have been pose in top designers’ suits, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete from work with concars.
They rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or apartment in which fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother can’t travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the jobs they want, but they are the most stressful.
There is not just one kind of weight loss.
Agent New York might ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
Models and designers are all the time together and operate as a support network.
When the fashion tips end, the difference is shaky.
Models want to be in this area because of the potential they offer, but they are used by the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models also want to be their own people.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors with some role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
You modeled yesterday at the Tory Burch show.
New York is currently hosting fashion weeks where designers will reveal their models next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, presents the most unknown assistant musician in the movie
In a film based on the early years of the Assistant Association, Roope Salminen presents the founding member of the band, Antti Lautala.
Lautala established Apulannan in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but separated from the band in 1994.
It's a big challenge for me because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I play a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Ant before the descriptions, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people from that crowd, so I think it’s good to learn his playstyle from the video.
I don't want to make an imitation about a man.
The man who trusts the Roope Salminen and the Dogs is not going to play the role.
The Punk Manners come by the man's nature.
In the punk period of the Stars, the stars will certainly have seen the premiere, as well as if you’ve ever been to our work.
Our presence has never been anything small, but we always go full.
Assistant in 1993-2004, Tuukka Temosen directed by us, the main actors of a beautiful film were released today.
The group’s public-known nuclear forces are presented by young actresses who are not yet familiar to the public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukkia presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo base from Tuukka Temo, Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint of his future pestilence last night, when he told Snapchat that he would mysteriously prepare his career for the most important day.
Roope has released a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he had to perform for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the fungus and jaws, has been driving his face into siloposchic, and dyeing his brown hair into black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have recently had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling about it at all?
It is not necessary to speak, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children are worth protecting, for example, not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and they can stay in mind and be distressed, he says.
However, if the child has encountered a television news photograph of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth speaking.
It is good to take a look at the starting points of the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of the child may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones that the parents think he is afraid of.
The child should not be frightened for nothing, even if he would be distressed and frightened.
The smaller child closely monitors the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe.
The older children are likely to encounter a debate on refugees in school, with friends or online.
Parents are good to take the matter with them if you think about the child.
The fact is that all people in the world are not well.
Parents, together with children, can think about how our family feels about this.
But is the world a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also talks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come forward in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teaching your children to help the weaker"
Your own power at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child.
Ballosalamaa is hard to control
Perttu Pohjola was stirred to the Apila Pallosalma in the middle of the summer.
It only led to wins and two places until the end of July a collapse in Tampere.
Since the ori was clogged in the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered it from the veterinarian for time.
The explanation for the extinction survived in the glider.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not the lesser to get away, but it was needed two curtains.
Since the Pallosalma of Apila had to be in light exercise, the Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku in a recording time after the second SE tamma in Taruntuule.
Apilan Ballosalama was at a pause when it had been able to drive normally only a few weeks.
These things at the end of the small tendency were understandable, Northeast says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made a blade for the slaves.
The horse's vibe must have gone forward, and hopefully it would also have been settled.
Apila Pallosalma has been so-called humor horses.
When it hasn't been fun, it could have thrown fat without diseases.
On the good day, the slaves have removed such a lightning letter that the opponents have been wondering.
In a quick speed, competitors are not able to manage the Pallosalama, from which even warm blood-blooded rides are removed.
The hopes of the north are in Vermo.
However, the different thing is how Apilan Pallosalma agrees with it.
It is quite difficult at the time of departure, and it may be under the bucket of the car and like that.
I hope the slave would be more calm than Turku's leaving.
Apila Pallosalma can also come out of the bow, and we are going to drive with it from victory, coach promise.
This is why you will not get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs
Tim Cook, Apple's CEO.
At least some of the future programs with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple will potentially remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, explains Tim Cook Buzzfeed’s executive director in the interview.
Apple's iPhone has a set of programs that are relatively rare to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Journalism, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips will come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is necessary only for Apple's smart clock owners.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook says Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work firmly together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating it, since the company does not want to waste memory on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation of the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
In August, the euro area’s consumer prices increased only scarcely, i.e. 0.1% of the year ago, and Eurostat said today by the European Statistical Authority.
The rise in prices was reduced by the low cost of energy.
Eurostat thus reviewed a slightly downward rate of 0.2% guarantee for a couple of weeks.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate for the underlying inflation was 1.0%.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2 per cent cheaper than a year ago.
The average inflation in the EU-28 was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Most of the euro countries, i.e. 1.4% of consumer prices, increased in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest at 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation of the euro area remains firmly far from the European Central Bank (ECB) objective, which is the average price increase of 2%.
The ECB predicts an average inflation of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the increase will increase to 1.1%, the central bank will expect new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The United States Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next recession of the United States begins with its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed regains interest rates for a long time.
The downturn in the financial markets begins before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that the interest rates will be started even this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be pressed on at the fastest by next autumn and as a course of the financial market before that.
Or at least this happens if the world’s largest economy and financial markets work as they have been habitually - and if they react to the tightening of Fed’s money hits as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been concluded by the German Bank Deutsche Bank’s London market research strategy Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle investigation.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its international major customers last week.
Strategies prepared by the study and the report do not believe that they know when exactly Fed will start raising interest rates or what happens in the economy and in the market.
Instead, they present economic statistics with their cool facts and calculations, how the economy and markets have previously acted at the time and after Fed’s increases.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at what the key variables of the economy and the financial markets are now at the same or different models as at the time of previous increases - and what may result from it.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more stunning condition to endure the rise in interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession, maybe not a year.
Fed’s monetary policy and its current uptake leaders have been pointing out in the last summer and the beginning of the autumn that the time will begin to be ripe to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate for over nine years can be reached this week.
The issue will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the Fed Board, so-called the Open Market Committee, meets at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds in June 2006.
At the same time, a series of relatively regular but at the same time of small 0.25 percentage points ended by Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The symptom of the financial market began in 2007 from the difficulties of the most risky housing funding in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis broke into a global nightmare of judgment.
A large recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious contradictions between the financial markets and the real economy began slower than after previous Fed's increases have typically occurred.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harder than once since the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategics have screened the rises and falls of the world's largest economies, as well as the translations of the financial markets from 1950 and from the beginning of the 18th century.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts will be cleared since the 1950s.
In the beginning of the recession, the first interest purchase has taken less than a year, mostly less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The rise in the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed's increases.
After the early 1950s, Fed has stepped up and in turn lowered its control rate to a dozen different cycles.
Each time has been different from some others, and there are relatively few times in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude any certain effects of the following increases.
The strategy reminds us that this time many things are different.
Not just better.
The interest rates are too low for too long
However, the key reasons for the financial crisis do not necessarily find out undeniably even with decades of research.
But three aspects of the causes of the crisis and its destructive power must be somewhat controversial:
1) The Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other major central banks in the world considered their governance rates too low in the 2000s.
They fixed the traces of the technocula, and at the same time raised the following.
2) In the various parts of the financial and real economy, over the decades, the amount of debt increased even more by the excess monetary policy of central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in the so-called economic history was born.
3) In particular, the insane debt finances packed in the financial economy, particularly the biggest course bubbles of financial history from shares to real estates, bonds and commodities in most areas of the financial market.
There is no doubt that the financial market that increased to the heights of more complex debts was rarely dangerous and unstable when Fed and other central banks last drove interest rates up.
The financial structures set up in the reserve of debt deposits, however, did not last until their time after the interest payments had begun and the costs of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and followed by a large recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
The Deutsche Strategies do not imagine what will happen next, but give the subject of intelligence to mention, for example, the following aspects:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been insane as it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the financial and real economy debt burden has not been reduced, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt burden has become more difficult than before or half before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from central banks to the former underground and cheaper has mostly remained in the financial market and the main types of securities and assets have slowed down the sum of the top or at any time prior to the financial crisis.
And not only the latical atmosphere, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and for decades from the most severe recession of the model as it has been before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but, accordingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are comparablely higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next steps to tighten its money flows.
Perhaps the French Bank of Societe Generale’s future image of Albert Edwards is not as strange as it may be.
He has trained international investor customers in the bank for the following full translations:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon Fedin is the time to turn off the financial fires with even greater QE cash bubbles.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are targeted by HP’s corporate service party, the company says.
HP is distributed in November to the Hewlett Packard Enterprise and consumer-oriented pc machines and printers focused on corporate sales.
HP’s staff were highest in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff were reduced to 302000.
The company records the single costs of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25000-30000 employees.
Consumer side reductions remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to low cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its business profits.
In the second year, three of its most significant customers brought 65 per cent of their profits.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the tax haven company
Anne Berner (kesk.), Minister of Transport and Communications, has been a member of the Board of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to Yle, the company’s activities were related to the so-called tax planning.
This is a Luxemburg Saltri II LuxCo company appointed by Berner as a member of the government in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Government.
Berner himself said he had left a notice of membership in May of this year.
I checked it out and that's enough for me to leave a notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control the registration chains in the agreed schedule, Berner says in the interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the Swedish Kährs Company’s ownership is managed.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner worked in Karelia-Upofloor’s government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs’ government and in Luxembourg.
According to the Yle, Kährs' ownership in Luxembourg is through a multi-step ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he received a government membership at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs in Luxembourg.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been involved in Karelia-Upofloor's government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was searched for a partner found in Sweden.
This company owned a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to take care of the benefits of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies’ capital revenues are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s ownership in the company is not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up for tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs had a capital fund in Triton for ownership already ready for the Luxemburg holding company.
Espoo opens a business-managed reception centre
In Espoon Otaniemi, the first reception centre operated by the company opens for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first hundred people from 6 a.m. today.
The number of locations can increase within a week to up to 300-400 people.
The Immigration Agency establishes the reception centre for the former Rescue College.
The activity is maintained by Luona Oy, which is a sector of production of healthcare and medical services in particular.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and the Luona Oy agreed together, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative work-life blackmail package
The STTK will prepare an alternative package for government excitement.
The organization also hopes that other wageholder centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently in the Friday demonstration.
Alternative ways to lower the price of work will be returned afterwards.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out the organization’s administration meeting for journalists at a break.
The palace estimates that the Central Economic Union (EC) is not ready for discussions.
The STTK’s economists have calculated that the security of the change contained in the Government’s Competitiveness Package will cost employers an estimated EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if the party is a huge enthusiasm to have a conversation if it is on the side of one relationship with the 100.
Fire: Negotiation connection was constructive
The Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk.) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, since the government is to give its own package a communication to the Parliament and to start preparing reforms.
The fire did not take a position on whether the timetable is realistic.
The connection to the government exists according to Palola, and it has been constructive for him all the time.
In the field of the STTK, especially the operation of Sundayians, according to Palola, is a painful place.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from mandatory legislation to implement part of the crises.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP presenting it.
Employees will meet on Friday to Helsinki to oppose the work life extortion package presented by the Government last week.
As part of the package, including the first day of illness, the salary is cut, the overtime allowances half, the Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
The STTK stresses that central organisations have invited employees to protest and have not been planning a strike.
Fjader
President Sture Fjäder thanks the STTK for preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjader, the STTK is now coming to the same lines with the Akava, as the Akava has already been further depicted as an alternative model for the government's presentations.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in an alternative package, as without the SAK package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Sture Fjäder hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will prepare the presentation as an alternative to cuts.
The STTK of Antti Palola told me that he was preparing new proposals on Wednesday.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the programme informed him that it has been preparing for a long time its own presentation, which it is ready to negotiate the 5% competitiveness of the country's government as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has always been ready to negotiate, and for a long time we have written an alternative model for government presentations.
We are ready to look at the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In response, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjader hopes that the SAK will also come to the Open Lines, as the STTK has done before Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
Now, together, we prepare a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The scheduled Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, coal, talkoot" - plays bingo while talking to Sipilä in the evening
the University of Tampere Green Left
The Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening of Viva's bingocupon.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the revolt and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy in the Yle channels on Wednesday at 21.05 p.m.
In applying for the last speech of the Prime Minister, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he took a famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the revolt of Mäntsälä.
After that, the president and the ministers held a number of radio calls during the winter and consecutive war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho, instead of President Mauno Koivisto, held a new year’s speech, but it was more ceremony.
In autumn 1976 President Urho Kekkonen stopped the strike of train drivers on television.
Solitary call, monarchist makeup
Sipila’s speech has raised criticism and assumptions throughout the day about what to come.
On Twitter, President Paavo Arhinmäki of the Left League said that "Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration of the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed."
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "one speech has already been seen.
Leadership is a dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Judges of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist makeup: the Prime Minister tells the people what's best for it".
The SDP president, Antti Rinne, challenged the Sipila dialogue: "A little for six months from the elections.
There is no unique presence from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of @juhasipila?
Public Service
According to the Government Office, Sipila’s speech is recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, the SAK president Lauri Lyly and CEO Jyri Häkämies of the SAK directly commented on it.
Yle has been criticized for the presentation of Sipila's speech.
We considered it and stated that it was part of the public service task to promote the full publicity of Finland, a line in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of the Yle publications.
Like Me Tammelos
The speech has also aroused irritations.
The evening dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be combine and dressed for their best.
Mom puts on the most beautiful collar, and Dad reconciles the tie with his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., we'll be slowed down to the TV as before at the time of Me Tammelos," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Does Prime Minister Sipilä, in his speech, also tell the reason why the Finnish government sits in tax havens that hide its capitals, which produce pardon laws for his other tax makers and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut off when the state has the end of the money?” asked Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the University of Tampere's Green Left, Viva.
It has published a bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, coal, debts and team spirit tonight?
Coupons and pencils ready, at 21.05 it begins and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: Western countries opposed the Russian proposal for the exclusion of al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer, in which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have been renounced, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaare, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan that al-Assad would be stylishly removed after a while.
However, the Western countries did not take the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin, in a bilateral debate, listed him the plan of three points: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and the al-Assad had to be immediately contacted, and the resignation of the power of al-Assad had to be undermined.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all things, but we are able to discuss it openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said to sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what to do, Ahtisaari remembers in the Guardian interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
Ahtisaari tells me that he sent a message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate for the newspaper, but Ahtisaare said there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaare's claims, but said that the Al-Assad troops had already committed several mass murders at that time, and the main opposition groups refused all the agreements he would have remained in power.
The former head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Middle East, Sir John Jenkins, has hesitated Ahtisaari’s speech, since his experience suggests that Russia was in no way prepared to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaare's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's talks, I would have said that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin to take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would also have suspected that it would have been Putin's crook to hold power on an al-Assad supporter.
Refugee flow of our own actions
During the Ahtisaare negotiations, about 7 500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of death victims exceeded 220 000 in the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to escape their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own actions.
I don't see any other choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we pay the bill we made, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Reservation Center for asylum seekers in Tornio
The settlement centre for asylum seekers planned by the Government in North Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The center would be founded in the building of the building of the Torino jointly empty in the city center.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsingin Sanomat news on Tuesday that the Council had already decided to present a school building to the ministry as a spatial solution.
According to the Vice-President of the City Council of Tornion, Sauli Hyöppisen (vas.), this is not true.
When the whole delegation was not in size and part of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the Council meeting to take the decision on Monday, he would specify to the STT.
At the meeting, 36 of 43 were authorised.
The organisation centre was opposed by 13 mandates.
On the basis of this, you might expect the decision to be positive, Mr. Huppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and quickly responded to it.
There would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been inspecting that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipila still hopes that the labour market is a choice for excitement
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), the public spending would only take part in the calculation of the price of the work sought by the government.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners are able to agree on that.
Sipila told journalists that he had not contacted labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations are looking for substitutes for the excitement of working life reported by the government.
If such a contract is concluded, we will be happy to accept it as part of the package.
In the opinion of Sipila, half-saving money would work as a means, because it would target almost all payers, unlike, for example, the operation of Sunday personals by the government.
Labour market organisations could agree on the operation of holiday funds as they are registered instead of law in collective agreements.
The government will present these views to the Parliament on Wednesday next week on the crises of working life as a Communication from the Government Council.
According to Sipila, the proposals of the organisations should be known before.
This isn't the ultimate rear limit either.
Legislative work then starts to move, i.e. the train is on the move and it gets harder all the time.
It's a good time.
Not long in such matters, if there is a will, Sipila shaped.
The list published by the Government last week includes, among other things, the change of the loppian and helatorstan into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the wages of the first day of illness are cut, overtime benefits are pooled, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are implemented by forceful legislation over trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, wageholder centre organisations will arrange a major appeal on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the stock of the juice hall
The Council of Tohmajärvi unanimously accepted the expansion of the stock of the Nordic Koivu Oy Hall, i.e. juice hall.
The fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally spoken.
A busy timetable is also depressed.
It was also a little wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when it was decided on the previous extension.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock at 400-450 square meters was approved in the investment programme, but the funding will be decided in the context of the next sub-annual report.
The agenda was still discussing the investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, the Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated to be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings work and tax revenue to the location.
The municipality has no risk because the company pays the investment as a rental, Vesa Väisstö (ps.) justified.
The place of Karelia in Joensuu
The city government enlightened its previous steep position to bring cattle-speaking streets to the center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the preservation of the animal tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital city of the cattle because there are no historical grounds and the cattle language is a natural part of the area’s identity.
The language spoken in the area of Joensuu has been more part of the Eastern Savos.
Even after a new decision, there will be no cattle-speaking streets.
However, the city of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, also prepared for the use of the cattle’s language in information tables and tourism marketing.
The same approach is recommended to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is an officially single-language municipality, it is also worth taking care of the use of the cattle’s language now that multiculturalism is living and changing dramatically in North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still the specific features of the county, as well as the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be well used in the multidisciplinary marketing of the province.
The termination of train connections cuts the vitality of the county
Train connection surgery strikes the province’s vital power with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the economy and competitiveness of the province.
And it affects whether there is a chance to live and work here, the city leader of Joensuu Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also highlights the airline, which has also been on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole province that we do not have the opportunity to reduce our government measures, as it is now going on.
It is necessary to look at the impact of these terminations on employment, for example, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of traffic connections leads to an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here are, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, Director Jukka Mönkkönen of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travel a lot for research.
Recruitment director Marko Junkkarinen says that it is difficult to market the university in Western Finland already because the links are in the cross-sectional direction.
At the moment, about half of the students from the University of Eastern Finland become outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of my wars to the war of Siu
The view of the city government of Joensuu on the regional war project is apparently unanimous, but one of the sora sounds is among them.
Pentti Centralsalo, a member of the city government (sd., in the picture), presented a resignation of the entire project at the government on Monday meeting, but his presentation disappeared unprofitablely.
The Governing Board approved Kari Karjalainen's decision-making proposal, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kouvola to Kouvola will end next year
Railway traffic from Kouvola to Kouvola will continue to be maintained, although one train pair will be fewer than one train.
The passenger train traffic between Kouvola and Kouvola will be subject to changes in the next March.
One train shifter leaves out, but still five times a day from the Eagle to Kouvola and the opposite.
Supplys are due to state savings.
The purchase funds of the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million for the next four years.
The quietest routes will be completely discontinued.
VR will draw up new schedules by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys got out of the place.
The rescue facility released a 12-year-old climbed from the climb to the roof, who was not able to get down from the roof.
The situation was born in Tornionmäki on the Ketotie at 6:30 Tuesday night.
There is an old two-layer wooden house in which there are no ladders on the roof.
It didn’t stop the boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that the rest of the people were stirred from the place and the passers alarmed the position of the rescue body to help the draws of the last roof safely back on the surface of the earth.
FedEx's turnover variations, weaker views for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weak result in the last quarter. The transport sector failed throughout the year after the results predicted the reduction in demand for freight services and the increased costs of land transport.
The company intends to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for a vacation period.
During this time last year, FedEx announced hiring 50 000 season workers for holidays.
The company’s share decreased by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the real trade opened on Wednesday.
The FedEx forecast is $10.40-10.90 for the financial year ending in May. The forecast is 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to the FactSet study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has decreased on average despite the price increases of 4.9%. The increases will enter into force on 4 January. The additional charges for heavy or large shipments will come into force in November.
The company is still expecting revenue growth from the previous year due to the increase in cost cuts, higher turnover and online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has been performing a well-intended weaker economic situation, which has tested in particular production and global trade.
A day after the competitor UPS announced his plans to hire most seasonal workers as last year, or 90 000 to 95 000 people.
At the end of August 31, FedEx’s operating profit was $692 million, which means a six percent increase.
The result was $2.42 per share, so the $2.44 forecast of the Zacks Investment Research company.
The turnover rose by 5% to 12.3 billion dollars.
According to the six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been undergoing a reduction in international-class broadcasts, which is why the company’s Express unit has been in place.
The strong growth in online trade has strengthened the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the cost of large-scale shipments and insurance was increased.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic fees, while the return on freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the real trading opened, the FedEx share rate had dropped $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the shares fell to 11% of the average of the year and 17% of the highest quote recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decision-makers of the United States Central Bank Fed will meet at the most expected meeting for years. A group will sit in the diameter of the eight-metre Honduras tree table to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
On the walls of the central bank’s decorative, double-layer meeting room, the wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues must prioritise the financial interests of the State in the interests of all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from the Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, after the large scale, the central bank’s management has noted the third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This mandate may be a lack of a piece of denial decision. On Thursday, the central bank will be required to indicate whether the U.S. economy is ready to start the withdrawal of an unpredictable irritation that the short interest rates that have been offered near zero in 2008.
Although the majority of the data indicate a stable growth in the economy, the recent deterioration of the financial markets can already be prepared by the officials of the Cabinet to increase volatility by raising the reference rate of federal taxes – even in the quarter of the percentage unit.
“The labour market and inflation are naturally the first and most important in monitoring their practice,” says Stifel Nicolaus & Co’s main economicist Lindsey M. Piegza.
“I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market is to give enough reason to wait for it,” Piegza continues.
Those who are concerned do not agree with what the central bank is going to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
Approximately half of the economists in Bloomberg’s study curved interest rates this week.
However, the financial market is believed to be expected by the central bank, and according to the main indicator, only 30% of the increase is possible.
If the central bank raises its control rate, the share rates may decrease unless the decision-makers soften the attack by promises of another increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average index cut 228,89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599,85.
"There were expectations of the central bank to maintain the governance rate this week," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group's main economician John Lonski.
“It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest rates at this stage,” he said.
“If this happens, the central bank should consider carefully how to keep the hands of the financial market unstrengthened.”
On the other hand, experts said that raising interest rates could be aligned with the financial market and eliminated uncertainty of the time the central bank is operating.
Only a month ago, the central bank appeared to increase interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in this month, which would be the first small step in strengthening the conditions of finance and through strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has stated that the interest rates expected to be raised this year in spring and early summer – despite the fact that the liberals say economic progress is needed.
While job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
Unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 per cent last month, which is now at the lowest level for seven years and close to the level that the central bank calculates as full employment.
Revenue seems to be reinforcing
While inflation continued to fall below the annual targets of 2% of the central bank, the decision-makers of the central bank stated that this is a major cause of steep temporary impact on oil prices.
“The company can manage higher interest rates and need them, as long as they take into account the strict situation on the labour market,” said Pantheon Macroeconomics’ main economician Ian Shepherdson.
However , financial markets across the world did not miss the last month when China devalved its currency.
The Dow Jones industry average dropped up to 16 percent of the record height in May, and investors feared the recession of the Chinese economy would also affect global growth.
The market has been cheered this month, and Dow Jones has already fallen by almost 10% of the May summit.
The deterioration of the market means to the decision-makers of the Central Bank that the increase in the governance rate is further fragmented.
"The work of the Central Bank will be complicated, despite what happened in the financial market and what news has been about China's economic weakening in recent weeks," said UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate's senior researcher and former central bank official Stephen D. Oliner.
He now believes that the central bank will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
“There is a great uncertainty about what will have an impact on the US economy. There is little reliable information about the recent situation in the Chinese economy,” Mr Oliner said.
The restoration of the world economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential factor in the world’s monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been huge in recent years.
In 2013, only a hint from the silly President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could reduce its scope was caused by implications around the world.
In today’s world, markets and economies are tightly interconnected, and in addition to monitoring the world’s trends, the central bank also requires communication with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the global economy.
"The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, the global strategy manager of the financial management company Envestnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker from the regional central bank of Richmond said this month that the central bank has previously overreacted to the movements of financial markets which seem to have no connection with the basic pillars of the economy.
Mr Lacker, a voted member of the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee), has called for an increase in the governance rate, and he highlighted the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999 as an example.
"The Asian economic crisis led to the decision that the central bank decided at three meetings to calculate the guiding rate of 0.75 percentage points, although only limited penalties were available for the economic growth of the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank revoked the decision.
"The Central Bank should put financial stability at the top only in a major crisis, such as the collapse of the 2008 economy," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest committee.
The last death is not even approaching the situation of the chairs,” he said.
“There is no need to fear the increase of the burdens because of the shock of the market,” Peterson’s Institute for International Economics Posen added.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention the stability of the monetary economy.

The Brazilian Rio Grande Children's Association promotes a good diet for breastfeedings
The Brazilian Rio Grande Children's Association SPRS has developed a blind way to teach women to breastfeed the meaning of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies breast-fed with unhealthy food images.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates. Thus, the baby receives all the diet needed and can develop a strong immune system.
As a result of extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by approximately 500 kilocalor.
In addition to increasing the number of calories, a new study suggests that other changes to diet should be made.
The recent study by professor Robert Waterland of the Baylor College of Medicine of Texas revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant woman can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have negative effects on the child’s immune system.
Seven Sunrise's most viewers, even though Nine is trying to get the lead on their Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would thank Canberra to make a morning program for the post-maining campaigns of the Liberal Party’s leaders, which did not much improve today’s viewers.
The 9th channel morning program was sent from the main city of Malcolm Turnbull, disposing Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage’s competing channel morning program was sent from London, and special broadcasts are also sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance was apparently not relevant to the Australian television viewers, as Sunrise looked at on average 397,000 viewers in five state capital cities, and today’s program was 339,000 viewers.
Today’s viewers slightly rose from last Mondays (317,000) and Tuesdays (283,000), but last Thursday’s readings remained (343,000).
Today has caught a distance to Sunris in the past few months.
In August, Today had an average of 318,000 viewers, Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached its average 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
Changes in the winds will affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The news drama recently tells of a widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand Coast with two children. The new series reached a huge 1,219,000 viewers.
The critics have doubted if Thomson would be the star of the hit series alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's viewers say the answer is clearly positive.
Sevenin The X Factor retained its strong position with 1 136,000 viewers. The series was brightly flooded by The Block (838,000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
Seven The Chase Australia has captured viewers in a variety of ways.
Andrew O'Keefe’s first half hour of the new visa series (17.00-17.30) followed 446,000 viewers on average.
In the second half hour (17.30-18.00), the number of viewers rose to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia’s first half had an average of 520,000 viewers, and the second half gathered a huge 720,000 viewers.
Hot Seat's audience was 620 000.
The Chase Australian second night's viewers showed to the Nine channel that Hot Seat is going to pass 17.30.

The final colonel thinks Sam Wood is really a dream-boyman – but who does the man choose?
Did the secret reveal?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed the choice of a dream boy.
Sam Wood's final choice of dreams has been a very secure secret.
The remaining three women do not squeeze a word of who has received the last rose from a boy.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the atmospheres before one of the three were dropped.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women shouted that Wood was a perfect man. Women praised the sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness and considered him a suitable partner for their own characteristics.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose wouldn’t hit their own site, their answers could let them know who takes the heart of a male man.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves the most suitable partner for Wood.
Everything between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been easy since the beginning.
"As soon as I came to the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam agreed well together. This feeling has remained throughout the program," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah has his feet on the ground, and he's really fun with you," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit that there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks he's a good partner and Sam Wood.
Mackay told me he realized last week's hometown date that Wood could be the right one.
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a race.
When they asked Mackay who Wood should choose if he didn’t choose him, she answered mysteriously:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls as much, Snezana and Lana are equal."

Jarryd Hayne has several options to start the NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne’s modified United States, and many other clubs were also interested in the man after the last year’s impressive open day.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some trainers would have kept Hayne's bench, as a man went to the Australian rugby team. Hayne shouted the win-win from Minnesota on Tuesday from 20 to 3.
However, Tomsula showed her trust in Hayne and gave her a new chance to return a flight shot. The coach held Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued in the dress box after the game.
He didn't rob any of the people in front of the other team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers Special Editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne shouts in the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fans had been waiting for another man from the NFL Debyy.
After the failure, Hayne left the field and later told Hamish and Andy 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined the worse beginning of his NFL career.
“They hurt and have to move forward,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared a mistake in the State of Origin series in 2007 when his feed was opened to Queensland.
Overall, the experience was incredible for a 27-year-old young man.
Hayne released a picture in Instagram where he pose together with fans and Australian tickets.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the Russian richest man Mihail Hodorkovski was arrested at the airport in Siberia.
Hodorkovski, who was openly challenged by President Vladimir Putin, was condemned, Jukos, the oil company owned by the man, was exiled and his democracy-protecting work was limited.
Four dead police officers shot with rubber wars in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, the source of authority told me Wednesday, and the police shot a bunch of people with rubber wars in a protest against the new constitution of the country, and there were four-year-old sons among the victims.
Violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region, about three hundred kilometres away from the capital city of Katmandus.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, over 1,000 protesters were gathered outside the police station, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tears and fired the air before shooting rubber shots.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber nodes that can kill, but which are generally considered to be less devastating, were suddenly so deadly.
This was the most recent confrontation of weeks in the Nepal South Poles, where, according to the Madhesiheim, the new constitution-based counties would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in West Nepal, where the Thrus tribe requires its own state.
At least 40 people, of whom 11 are police officers, have died in violent bulls since 10 August,
When the four major political parties signed the agreement on the distribution of the country to counties, this is a significant step towards the new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the administration has been centralized for centuries.
The new constitution has been worked since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after thousands of people died in a shocking earthquake in April.
Legislators have voted on constitutional clauses in Katmandu this week, and the authorities say that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Centre: 60% probability for Cyclone in the south of Cape Verde
From a large low pressure area about 560 km from the southern parts of Cape Verde Islands, 60% of the probability of developing a tropical cycle within the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center (National Hurricane Center) announced Tuesday.
According to the Miami Air Science Institute, Cape Verde and the Small Antills are also located in the middle of a clear low pressure centre. It can also be 60% likely to become a tropical cyclone over the next two days.
Google plans to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced launching a campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign in its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead, the campaign was launched by Google’s employee Rita Masoud by telling his own experiences. He was only seven years old when he escaped from Kabul with his family.
“We traveled in the dark with a train and a bus and we experienced hunger, thirsty, cold and fear,” Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the European refugee and migrant crisis has been exacerbated, many families in the same situation are desperately in need of help.
Gifts are allocated to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children’s Association and the UN Refugee Organization.
Once donations have been collected through Google.com/refugeerelief $5.5 million, Google will be willing to donate the corresponding amount, thus the total amount will reach 11 million.
The European Refugee Crisis is the worst of the Second World War, especially the four-year civil war in Syria, which has caused over four million people to flee their home this year.
The war is also forced to escape from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetes can benefit from obesity surgery
According to the new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetes patients may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether you live mildly overweight type 2 diabetes after obesity surgery longer than those who receive uncutting treatment.
"Acquiring mortality data takes time," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a obesity surgery expert, who dealt with a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, i.e. bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach bag by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit food absorption in the body.
During the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective treatments in type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have been affected by patients with an overweight body weight index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index indicates the weight and length in which the normal value is 18,5 to 24,9.
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is overweight and the weight index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers from the Taiwanian Min-Sheng Hospital benefited from data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two obesity surgery methods, gastric surgery and sleeve surgery, patients with mildly obesity treatment of type 2 diabetes.
After obesity surgery, the average weight index fell from 31 to 24,5 to the end of the fifth year of study.
The weight index of those treated with non-cutting treatment remained in the sense of 29.
Diabetes treated with surgery improved by 36% and partly by 28%.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely only by 1% and partly by around 2%.
According to the study, blood pressure, triglycerides and malignant LDL-cholesterol were better in the surgery group.
Researchers also followed the haemoglobin-A1c levels of patients, which reflect the development of blood sugar levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin-A1c level is below 7%.
After surgery, haemoglobin-A1c decreased from 9% to 6% on average.
In the drug-treated group, the value remained unchanged at approximately 8%.
However, the study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu noted that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different cutting methods.
In the fifth year, the weight loss in the gastrointestinal surgery group was higher compared to the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the weight loss was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as well as the haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%). The control surgery group also improved perfectly with the majority of diabetes (46.9% and 16.7%).
However, in the new study, it was not possible to demonstrate a lower mortality after five years. According to the Swedish study of Blackstone, the surgery of the Phoenix University of Arizona College of Medicine will bring life years to fat people.
In a Swedish study, fatty persons with a gastric miscarriage had a decrease in mortality rate of 29% compared to the conventional treatment group in 15 years.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone found that people with a weight index of less than 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the main finding of the study, as it says the surgery is safe in the lower weight index group and does not increase the risk of loss or kidney diseases," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is 27-30.
“We wait too long for people to start taking the situation seriously,” the researcher said.
"When genetic changes have been accumulated in the human body, which are presuming obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to turn the situation."
“Everything cannot come to Europe” Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has stated, and he said that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of the Buddhism of Tibetan has called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama discussed the refugee crisis in his speech in the United Kingdom. Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, which focuses on ethical research in Oxford.
According to the Dalai Lama, humanity must be placed prior to individual countries or continents in the present situation.
He also stressed that although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis needs to be admired, it is not sufficient in this situation.
“It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” Dalai said.
Although Dalai-Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their efforts in a crisis situation, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Government of thousands of refugees is a fantastic act, but at the same time there are long-term solutions to think about and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," Dalai Lama stressed.
“In the end, we need to consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
Power use needs to be reduced.
Power tools have never solved problems," he added.
When talking about violence, the Dalai Lama commented on George Bush’s actions in the event of the 11th September terrorist attacks and claimed that the United States had an uncontrolled event chain in response to the terrorist attack.
After the 11th of September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution was made through non-violence.
I know his purpose was good, but he used the means of forces that had unpredictable consequences,” Dalai Lama said.
Handdes swallowing cases have fourfolded in children in four years.
According to the Georgian Poisoning Centres across the United States, alcoholic strength is reported in children under the age of almost fourfold in cases of severe hands swallowing in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to the CEO Gaylord Lopez, in children under the age of 12 years of age, the cases of toxicity to toxic centres increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
“These products are more and more accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children are being put in emergency care,” Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink handdes intentionally, part of making an impression on their friends and part of social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers who drink disinfection because of cheap drunk.
Teens are reported to mix alcoholic oral water with a disinfectant in order to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can attract the smell of handdes.
"The child doesn't think the substance is bad," Lopez said.
"A large part of the attractive hand desks are just smelled.
There are strawberries, grapes and orange flavors of strawberries that appeal to children."
The alcoholic strength of disinfectants is between 45 and 95%.
A small number of children can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content of my hands is very high," told Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Kansas University Hospital Poisoning Center, Fox 4 in Kansas City.
“No one would leave whiskeyshots to children, but if hand disinfection products are often left to children, they will quickly receive a large amount of alcohol.”
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four strawberries of strawberries in school, and the girl was delivered for emergency care.
"The alcohol content of the girl's blood was 179, which is double compared to the adult humidity limit," says the girl's doctor Chris Ritchey from the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah sopers and he couldn't walk when he was brought to the emergency.
Doctors followed the girl’s room overnight in a separate child hospital for brain damage, because she had fallen and beat her head after having alcohol,” Ritchey said.
"Your account was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortori Scott, told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products and disinfection towels, in addition to the need to move your hands into reachless children.
In addition to alcohol discrimination, some of the disinfectants are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two ontario women died after swallowing handdess that contained a toxic substance that was not reported.
The health authorities considered that the product contained fatal metanolysis instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter was reported as the active substance in the product leaflet.
According to the police report, three fourth grade students in the northern part of New York State planned to kill a "nasty" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to handdes and prohibited its importation into the classroom.
The police believed that the approved plan was irrelevant and urged the school to exercise disciplinary measures.
Humylly: not unsufficient in the Celtic rows
Griffith undermines the unspokenness of the Celtic team, while Deila admits that the team is not all right, but believes that the situation will be resolved.

Griffiths reduces speeches from unsovable
Griffiths has ignored the rumors of the unsovious app in the Celtic rows. According to their own words, Griffiths and his teams are not targeted as an observer when preparing to meet the Dutch serial director.

The Dutch need an old Scotland couple – de Boer
Former Rangers’ middle field player and Dutch team player Ronald de Boer have stated that the interest of Dutch football fans has been disrupted for Celtic because there is no longer any chance to follow Celtic and Rangers’ double stretchs.
De Boer, a team leader in Ajax, said: “There’s no more Celtic games. Why?
Because Rangers are no longer involved.”
“This is not just about the return of Rangers.
We're talking about Old Firma.
The Dutch people need two teams.
Old Firm’s games have a huge tension, and they are also interested outside Scotland’s borders.”
I turn the situation back, Deila assures
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is difficult, but the Norwegian credit assures that there will be a change in the situation.
Malmölle's lost company fell from the Masters League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had some difficult episodes before, and we will rise again," Deila said.
“We want to increase our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrational, and in many people it causes anger or sorrow.
We too, but we have to move on.
We urgently need support for Celtic's support, as it greatly strengthens players.
The common spirit is now very important.”
Warburton Careful for January Player Transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, the Rangers Boss Mark Warburton pointed out the January game transfer targets, he takes care of the transfer roller and says that he wants to compromise the unity of the team.
“January player transfers differ significantly from summer transfers,” said Brentford’s ex coach.
"The team-related players in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the beginning of the season, which has been successful in our composition this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary gambling can cause more harm to the team than benefits."
Michu in the Celtic Retirement Goal
Michu, a Swansea attacker, has been associated with Celtic in playlist transfer calls, and Michu has been implying retirement after the end of the Swans agreement.
Michu, a 29-year-old, has been an abusive ankle for years, and he has not managed to get a move from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA on Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2 to 1, when Paterson was removed from the field. The team eventually lost 3 to 2. The Red Card of the Defense was later revoked. This is already the third Collum red card within eight months, which is revoked.
However, Neilson stays behind his words. "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance.
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was reluctant to admit that he was slandering songs from the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in the pub in Edinburgh Roseburn, before the Edinburgh local match at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match, and the atmosphere was intense," the attacker said. "I can't guarantee I'm not going back to Tynecastle except Celtic."
Tannadice’s Management Team believes in Dundee United Training Management – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that the Dundee United Management Group can turn the situation better.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're getting the boys ready to fight," said Donnelly.
McInnes is pleased with the Hamilton victory with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen had to despise desperately against Hamilton in front of his seventh consecutive league victory, winning Aberdeen grabbed a five-point neck at the top of the Celtic serial table, which is to thank Adam Rooney for punishment in the first half.
“There is no cup or league team that would not have won such games,” McInnes said.
Unemployment in Scotland, growing in the British Islands
The rules of employment remained unchanged in Scotland in May to July. There are 164,000 unemployed in the United Kingdom. The number of unemployed in the UK increased at the same time by 10,000.
According to the United Kingdom Statistical Centre (Office for National Statistics), the unemployment rate was 5.9% in Scotland when it was 5.5% in the UK as a whole.
There are 12 000 employees in Scotland less than three months earlier. The number of employees now is 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent in the quarter and the average employment rate in the UK as a whole is 73.5 per cent.
Scottish Minister David Mundell commented on recent figures: "The long-term plan of administration has created a foundation for a strong economy."
Almost a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision on maintaining as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment has decreased.
Why do I follow the execution of Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there is a legal basis for revocation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, what I do not hope, I will sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penalty Prison, when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation through a man’s best friend and despite my shock, I responded positively.
When the day comes, I'm terrified.
Then why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought I could tell the truth about the death penalty.
The perspective would be unique.
Suppliers will be able to follow executions in the United States, and since applications are more than places, the participants will be selected with the value of the countryside.
Oklahoma has reduced the positions of journalists from 12 to 5.
The selected are following the execution moderately.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends. I've created a man for a personal relationship because we've been on the phone several times over months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I can’t be present in the property of both the witness and the supplier, so I’m not allowed to take the notebook and the pen to make notes.
I just have to try to press the details into my mind.
I was accused by an Occanomian journalist on Twitter for jeopardizing neutrality.
"The idea is this:
When you tell the convicted story in a pleasant way for him, you'll get close to him."
I gave the journalist my different opinion.
The editor admitted that he could have shaped his word more carefully, but still think I was wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some things I have said and written.
He doesn't decide what I'm writing, and even if he's trying to order, I wouldn't obey.
I've told him that he can remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public promotes the movement against the death penalty.
Huffington Post journalist Kim Bellware will sit next to me.
If you want more information about this, you can listen to my podcast.
I will not repeat the details in this context.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, he would be committed to administering him after the crime.
However, I believe it is very likely that a man in Glossip has not been committed to murder.
I absolutely believe that there was not enough evidence for the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
You can read an unbiased description of other journalists.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die in vain.
The man was attracted from Canning River after a watery police hunt.
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry when attracted a man up from the Canning River.
The escape company of the Perthian man took you into a low, mud water, and a police officer in a few metres away got landed back to the dry land.
The Canning Vale Police received a call on Tuesday for unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, the police found a suspect who tried to get rid of the police by heading to the Canning River.
However, the man did not get far.
"The man standing in the water announced that he would not come out of the water and urged the police to get him in the water," Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec's costume was not humiliated, so he chose a safer tactic – a negotiation.
"Sometimes, the attempt to escape makes people use the fun means," Sergeant Castledine said.
The case of Football Master Ben Cousins is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid police blowing and tried to swim on the other side of Swan River.
The company of the man was condemned, but the temperament inspired the locals to plan the Ben Cousinsbiathlon.
According to Peter Moody, journalists tried to spy, and he threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria's journalists of the spy company last year, and the man threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody argues that journalists and Racing Victoria’s insolvency department have personally attacked him, and Lady Tata’s rejection was the last drop on Wednesday due to recent treatment on the race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to work for competition sports. Moody has been in a difficult situation when Lidar found cobalt in the sample and the man could not explain the finding.
Moody has kept his tongue in control of the spy accusations for a period of sixteen years and did not want the accusations to affect the action of a bitter man.
“I didn’t intend to raise it up, but I thought about it for a long time, but sometimes frustration is dissolved with a single throw,” Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
“Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences. I have to accept the space now after I open my mouth.
I'm going home and sleeping well.
I want the horse owners to think I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to continue as a horse trainer anymore.
I have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier at the Racing.com interview, where he told me about the spying companies of the Independence Department on his cabinet.
"Fourteen years ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job on my tall to spy on my actions. I'll tell the man's name when asking," Moody said to Racing.com.
“They clearly believe I’m a scam.
If so, they should present evidence, for I have not been caught in any unlawful.
The former President of RVL Robert Roulston, current President of RVL David Moodie and current CEO Bernard Saundry were aware of the action at the time and now.
Should I consider the situation as a personal driver?
Should the RVL take real action and take responsibility for the situation in the field for non-trainers?
Do I have a problem with the industry?
Do I really harm the industry?
Maybe a lot of people think that.
Maybe I'd still have a training license and push me away from my tasks, no doubt I can get a lot of people to think that through my speeches.
But I'm at the point I don't care anymore, it's sad.
It's really sad.
I'm pushing them to make their decisions.
My family supports me and I can withdraw.”
The long-standing Lidar cobalt study and the recent neglecting situation eventually made the coach frustrated in such a way that the man threatened to give up his license.
Moody is known as the best coach of the unbeatable master Black Caviar. The man described the rule of treatment of the race day for laughter after the horse's legs were in violation of the rules.
“The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it," Moody said.
"The person who belonged to my family wrongly put sauce on the foot of the horse.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done last night, and so did it.
But it happened on the race day."
Moodya may expect a three-month ban on anti-competitive clay treatment that the organisers have started to investigate.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been formulated by someone who does not know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this is going too far,” Moody said.
Arrested from Cobram's crash site
The police have arrested a man who crashed on the weekend who escaped from the crash.
The bike driver was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with a helicopter, and he got serious injuries to hit him by Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man who drove a car escaped from the place and did not leave to help the injured bike driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia announced to Shepparton police.
The person is likely to be accused of neglecting stopping and assistance obligations in traffic accidents and other traffic violations.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital care, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy refers to opponent paintings
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy believes the criticism of the team's gambling game as the purpose of two NRLs.
According to Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm the painting to the troubles of Melbourne's hosts in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos, coach Wayne Bennett, covered the hardest reference to Storm Broncos's winning quartz final at Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game for a model match and noted that Queensland was more interested in the painting.
Bellamy defended his own team's fight and said they were just focusing on the contact when they fought.
Bellamy added that his trust in his own team added that two top team coachs criticized his team. Bellamy considers this as a demonstration of the fact that the coachs worry about losing Storm.
"Trent Robinson said nothing about pain when his team won us 24 to 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defense system or techniques throughout the year. For the last six weeks, we have only been investing in contact games and fights that have turned us upside down.
Trent has been busy for three years, and the loss could have been a shock to him because he has a great team that hasn't been used to losing.
It’s funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting football, and he reminded his mentor that Bennett St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his own team from Saturday to Friday’s game and considered their game interesting,” Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St. Georgea received a lot of criticisms in part of his boring game. Wayne said that the review didn't give him a moment.
Now he has a team that is able to play so-called football, especially his young, fast mid-contractors.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the player's arsenal is like this.
He highlighted this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style. All teams do not have centralists like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more self-confidence when other coachs are so worried about meeting my team that they take advantage of this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think they would meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the Storm and Roosters game made more paintings than when Broncos and Cowboys met.
Broncos was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
The result of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are game breaks and low quality interesting football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend, since the team will be able to visit North Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday at AAMI Park. The tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man freed up against $200,000 in a drug case
The man who was smuggled to Queensland for a lifetime sentence of 40 kilos of cocaine in possession has been released against $200,000 guarantees.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month by a policeman found a hundred kilos of cocaine cargo in Solay, who had come from Vanuatu through South America and arrived at Coomera port in August.
The police watched Maksimovic's meeting with a criminal partner at a boatport during the morning and surprised two later at the Coomera Roadhouse coffee shop. The Toyota Echo car was found in the parking area for 40 kilos of drugs.
Although Maksimovicia may expect life-long drug possession for commercial purposes, according to a man's lawyer, there is no evidence that his head had tried to get the whole batch, but a man could have been in the cafe for innocent purposes.
According to the Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maksimovic is trying to escape from the country.
"Maksimovic has clear contacts with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," the judge said at the court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
Maksimovic’s mother and stepmother paid together 200,000 guarantees against which the man was released.
"After reading the oath of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
“But it is not enough to prevent a man from fleeing alone,” the judge warned.
Maksimovic was released on condition that he would give up both Australian and Serbian passports, sign up to the police every day and stay home from 6:00 to 6:00.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to get pedofils to send pictures
Pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to take pictures of children being exploited.
Stevan Hogg took the phone when he slept and logged in to an online message service where he got another user to send inappropriate images of children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed the phone disappeared, and she found her sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she explained the content of her phone, she found shocking messages and told her mother immediately.
These five photos were reported to the police, and after investigating the computers found on the address, the police found disturbing internet searches using searches for unsuitable children's images.
Hogg said to the police that he was trying to mislead pedofils on the Internet and that he played the police to scare pedofils.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said at the local judiciary at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be dependent on the scary of people.
He admitted that he had done the graves on the computer, but he claimed that he was acting so to present the police and thus to scare the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent pictures to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead pedophiles.
He said he had distractive thoughts when he drank and wanted to watch pictures of rape and murders.
Robertson added: "After the message from the phone, the girl screamed her mother whispering and crying."
The girl saw inappropriate photos on the phone, after which Hogg was interrogated.
She told the defendant that she used a computer and Playstation to talk to herself much younger girls.
23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward acknowledged the accusations of the possession of inappropriate children's images last June. Hogg violated his release against warranties on 25 January this year and left the court for hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to register sexual offenders, as it can be considered that there were no significant sexual features in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the declaration of judgment to October due to the background reports of social work.
Hogg was released against warranties in this case, but he was held in prison on other grounds of investigation.
Hogg was added to the register of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Zimbabwen Robert Mugabe holds the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest head of state in Africa, Mugabe fell to the speaker’s height in the leading stairs earlier this year.
Mugabe did not get hurt, but the video of what happened spread quickly in social media.
The objections of the opposition party's legislators were also shadowed by Parliament's openings that they have received anonymous threats of killing in which they are warned that they would be bumpy to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, the representatives of the people bounced and interrupted the speech of the President in Parliament on the state situation, and the President held the same speech on Tuesday.
The MDC Party (Movement for Democrat Change) Bishop Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians have received text messages in which they are urged not to disturb Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is "death", Gonese told journalists after Mugabe spoken.
The message warns the recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer in the immunity circle.
According to the party, Morgan Tsvangira's party is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings of business services.
HP is distributed to two stock exchange companies later this year and separates computer and printer business from faster growing business equipment and service operations.
According to HP’s newsletter, the company records a single cost of $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter.
“Restructuring arrangements allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said HP’s CEO Meg Whitman, leading the company after distribution.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we have extensive and deep portfolio business that will help businesses move into a new business style." Whitman said.
As a company, our position is better than ever and we can better respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world.
The annual turnover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise is over $50 billion and the company focuses on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company established by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard at Stanford University in the 1930s is now divided into two.
HP has implemented massive reorganisations when traditional desktop computers are switching to mobile devices.
The second largest computer manufacturer in the world and the largest technology companies in the United States are the latest transfer of HP in the field that believes that concentration will bring success.
Captain Mikel Arteta of Arsenal: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed Wilsher that it is only September. If everything goes well on the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to skip at least the following four British country team games. The history of the man, knowing his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest problem of the last problem is that Wilshere decided firmly after the last season and appeared to have returned to his former blade during the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten career," Wenger said.
"The bone was not well healed.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, however, as Wenger also said, additional injuries can come when the player tries to return to the field in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant regularity.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different efforts since Wilshere debytoed six years ago.
He also played in the Arsenal rows in only 65 out of 157 leagues during the last five seasons.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that since the period 2007-2008, the team has been one of the most injured teams since six eight seasons.
Wenger accepts a potential witch circle, but Arsenal believes that the injuries statistics that improved last year continue to develop in a better direction.
"Sometimes after the injury, the return can be associated with a vulnerable period when you need to strengthen your body and apply for competitive powers," Wenger said.
"Jack is young, so he'll get through this.
I hope that he will balance his body, and I believe it, and with it his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal starts his Master's League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. Then the team meets Chelsea on Saturday and the Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday. Wenger prepares small changes to the composition.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to begin.
Wenger can also place a starting meeting in the place of Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the balance of the team and give rest time to those who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F group, Maksimir Zagreb has the most scary stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been invincible for 41 games.
The Stadium was shaken on Tuesday night when the country was vacuuming at 3.2 Richter degrees.
The tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his last season’s homework after having to tend to Monaco, and he is still motivated by a far-reaching wish to trust the team towards the European championship.
"We have a huge energy charger," Wenger said.
"Arsenal has not yet hit this title.
We were very close in 2006, on the other hand, with experience, I’m also realistic.
We are ambitious but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us truths about friendship between men
A similar description of his absence in other series is worth noting, especially when it is taken into account that the need for men to open is greater than ever and that young men’s suicide statistics are highest for 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most important cause of death among men aged 20-45 in the United Kingdom. The suicide is three times more common among men than women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) addresses the problem by proclaiming the year 2015 men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from applying for the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed. According to the study, the chances of healing depressive symptoms are better if there are enough healthy people around them.
The likelihood of unsymptomed persons was also halved if there were people near them who had no mental health problems.
But everything is based on friendship.
Modern communications dominates social media, and the communication style is often more important than content. Fast response is often considered more important than relevant contact.
With the digitalization of life, the need seems to be strong, fun and successful doubled, even though insulation is reality.
Outside the values, money, image and social status related to surface success. These all take the attention of internal values and of our natural personal growth and friendship. The internal values seem deeper to our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently stated that money can’t actually buy happiness.
Frendie’s fineness was the fact that the series reversed its focus.
No one of the characters in the series was defined by the profession, but by personality. This appeared in friendship relationships.
The series was humoured by Joey and Chandler humiliating or watching football on their TV chairs, and we often saw Ross missing Rachel, and it was clear that men were able to match this, even though they did not stop feeling full.
One volunteerer explained this to me: “When I hear people depressed and suicidal to me, it has become clear how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men contact us are often unable to speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should be able to cope is strong. The man is easily considered weak if he speaks about his problems."
"Frends are one of those series that present long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can provide help from the outside for a moment of despair, but long-term support is obtained from the nearby community of friends and families."
For the honor of Comedy Central FriendsFest, the series stages have been raised to life. So if you participate in the event this weekend, you should take your friends to Central Perki.
Or do something better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
Never know how important a friendship can be.
Comedy Central sends the whole Frendit series – all 236 episodes – #FriendsFesti
Di Maria's hit helped PSG to defeat Malmön
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after making a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in the painting of the Master's liiga debyyte and helped PSG to hit the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Read the game report and evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were attacked when Paris Saint-Germain started his work at the Master League by hitting Malmön Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal when the debut game was played for less than four minutes. He confirmed the position of the French champions immediately in hand. However, PSG shook several goals before they finally could add his lead: Cavani painting glass, when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A block also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG is not only seeking a post-track in the drop-off games, but also wants to improve the positions for the quarterly range in the remaining three matches.
Although SPG captured the points, the match was not perfect for Laurent Blanc's trusted team display. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the painting position and the man got replaced when he had his former home club, where he started his career in 1999.
“In the Master League, it’s not easy to win at home or in guests, so 2-0 winnings and good shots give a good foundation, even though we’re still disappointing for the season,” Blanc said.
"This knows good.
We were thirsty and we were able to do it, but we were not able to make one or two extra paintings."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after the injuries, and the team was forced to be satisfied with the 2-2 plane in the Lague 1 series against Bordeaux. However, Di Maria left her shadow in Ibrahimovic at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentinian ferry from Manchester United to PSG ranks was named the PSG solver, which raises the team to a new level in Europe. He proved to be worthy of the name when he praised the ball from Marco Verratt's feed over Malmo's defense, and then shot the exact goal in the back corner of Johan Wiland.
However, those who were expecting the rupture of PSG had to be disappointed.
Malmö flourished in Celtic's drop-off games, marched on the field nine international players since the start. The team playing with five men's defenses and two attackers' tactics was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot was scarcely over Kevin Trappi's paint in the back of the game at 34 minutes. The team didn't attack very actively.
Instead, PSG fell into unnecessary feed and weak finishing, and not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five destinations only during the first half of the time. At the beginning of the second half of the second half, Ibrahimovic kicked the paint for potatoes in Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his nails in the feed game. From Ibrahimovic's feed Di Maria shot a torch kick over Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was born at the time of the county, thanks to Cavan, and the sixless-playing slot shot a full stake when Ibrahimovic kicked him out of the left-handed Maxwell fire.
Malmo's letter ended in the second goal, and only Wiland's top fight from David Luiz's distance to shoot the shooting was kept in control, and the goal of Ezequiel Lavezz was abandoned with the end meters.
Malmo's bullet Åge Hareide admitted afterwards that PSG was in his own class. "We played the last Master's League game in December of the last year.
After that, we have only played in the Swedish League, where the level is not the same.
The carcines aren't enough.
A hat for Paris.
This was a top match from them."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion with stock
The Swiss mine left Glencore, which was lowered by the prices of raw materials tested, collected $2.5 billion in the midweek stock as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed in the London Stock Exchange, said in his opinion that he sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion to reduce debts.
The company’s market value decreased by 57% this year. The company will be painting the price of raw materials when the Chinese economy’s recession impairs demand and stresses the market.
With the stock purchase, Glencore’s share price was painted at the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The share grew by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 per cent in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to 0.69 per cent.
Glencore announced last week its intentions to collect $2.5 billion in stocks as part of the strategy to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold new shareholders at a price of 125 pounds, with a decrease of 2.4 per cent of Tuesday's closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99% of the whole group.
The concern of the continuation of the Chinese economy's recession has caused the price of iron malt to fall by half, while the decrease in carbon, copper and other commodities has been between 20 and 40%.
The White House strengthens Xi Jinping's Washington Visit
The Communication published on Tuesday by the White House confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives at his first official visit to Washington on 25 September. This is a visit from President Barack Obama to Beijing last November.
After bilateral discussions between the Heads of State, the president and the spouse of the President Michelle Obama will organize dinners for the public visit to Peng Liyuan to Xi Jinping and his wife.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will allow you to extend cooperation between the United States and China in the area of a wide range of global, regional and bilateral topics of interest between both parties. At the same time President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on issues of which are disagreed," the White House Communication said.

Matt Damon reduces diversity in the film
Matt Damon talked to African American Effie Brown and said that there was no need for diversity behind the camera.
In the HBO Project Greenlight series on Sunday evening, an actor who experienced Brown was interrupted when this explained how important it is to take into account the different views of the project on the dark main character of the script selected.
“The multitude is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the program,” Damon said.
Brown was stabbed and injured by the claim. "Oh, it's clear," she said after Damon's comment, a single Mars film stared at Damon.
Damon and Brown were gathered together with the brothers of Ben Affleck and Farrelly to discuss the finalists of the race.
“Whoever is a director, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony is being presented,” Brown said at first.
"The only dark character is a prostitute who has sex with his white mate."
The Dear White People film producer supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as directors of the film. Damon replied very hard that the choice of the twin could lead to an unwanted outcome.
When the conversation was made on TV, the social media exploded about Damon’s bad comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger about the scene in direct words: “Matt Damon speaks on the only dark person to explain what diversity is, it’s so prominent that it hurts.”
Tweets were distributed more than 5000 times, and they liked it 4,000 times.
Damon’s comments hit the time when the media’s fair representation of human races is the first topics of speech.
After a teenager Michael Brown died of a white police bullet in 2014. The Black Lives Matter movement received support throughout the country. The business aims to stop the discrimination of legislators and authorities.
In February, singer Prince referred to the issue by presenting a year's album candidates in Grammy's gala.
"Albume still matters," he said.
"It's like books and dark people's lives, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter published an opinion in response to the Fow News Elisabeth Hasselbeck question as to whether this group should be classified as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love-based group," the leader said.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and media moguls called to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether Damon responded positively to the invitation.
American Ninja Warrior Series First Winner
The professional biker and dish collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed a million dollars.
During the seventh season of the TV series, all of the tasks given were first examined.
In the last episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten survived the last round.
In the last task, men had to pain the 23-metre rope up in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first competitor to complete the fourth stage of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero was three seconds faster and became a winner.
Caldiero told E!News he was still shocked after he caught a million dollars.
“The amount of victory is incredible, because I’ve never earned more than $10,000 a year,” he said in an interview with E! about his winnings.
“Once, I can’t even imagine what this is going to happen, the future is open.”
The corresponding producer Kent Weed talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten is not rewarded, even if he was the first competitor who has cleared all the tasks.
According to the rules, the fastest winning money.
If more competitors find out all the tasks, the fastest win," Weed explained.
“The money prize is beautiful and transforms life, but also Britten receives satisfaction.
I don't think he's gonna keep it up.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received great praise from fans.
Britten is a great guy for whom the family is important.
His children and his wife consider him a hero.
Geoff told me that because he didn't win himself, he would prefer to win Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought of him as well if the situation had been different.”
America Ninja Warrior renewed for the eighth period, whose descriptions begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers squeezed victory from Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- Detroit Tigers have no particularly comfortable experience in the second half of the season.
The Tigers belonging to the best teams in Baseball are now the last place of American League Central.
However, the team succeeded on Tuesday by hitting Minnesota on the Twins Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to rise to Houston Astros to fight the second wild card site of dropping games.
Detroit returned, although only for one evening, to the taste of victory, which has been on the second half of the season behind the stone.
“Every win is nice, no matter how it is achieved,” Brad Ausmus said.
The Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon kept its surface when Detroit succeeded three times in the first two pairs, once in the sixth and once in the ninth pair.
Simon (13-9) feeds 6 1/3 rounds of good games and released three runs.
He has only had three good starts in nine outdoor shifts.
“I just want to decide the season strongly this year,” Simon said.
"It's hard to throw a driver in every game, and that's why I want to feed to the sixth shift."
Victor Martinez got three hits from the Tigers feeder and hit two runs that were his first hits after the mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three hits night after he got four hits against Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He hit well," Housmus said.
"He looks good at hitting exercises and kept the play in the game."
On the seventh round of the second round, Twins had the best chance to get back to the game.
Byron Buxton started a turn of two nests by hitting close to the left side limit by a hit.
The right coupon Aaron Hicks hit the sacrifice shot, and Simon took the second Brian Dozier, who took three direct feeds before he became left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free artifact for Mauer, a new feeder's vice verbs Miguel Say hit two pess hits, and after her the right hand came Drew VerHagen.
