Emel Kouki led to Hurrikaan's home win in opening - Savo Volley
Seven times the Mestaruusliiga Medals of the Men’s Flyball began the season 2018-19 at home, when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Emel Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the 22-point Hurrican’s most effective player.
There were some intrusions for foreign countries, but they did not come true, and then came a call from Loimaa.
It was pretty fast to get the deal agreed, Kouki said.
Like Kouki, Loimussaki played Tomi Rumpune's support for Kouki at 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the country team of Samuli Kaislasalo at 17 points.
The winning of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience on the side, and it brought an additional ecstasy to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but the continuation of the medal pipe is of course the goal, Kouki said.
The Most Effective of Savo Volley
Miro Määttänen was the 18-point Savo Volley’s most effective when the team shreds by Viering Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was incredible, especially in the attack, but fortunately, we gained a squeezed victory.
At least I didn’t have any conscious different downloads when I played against my former team, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 3rd series in the next Flyball season 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with a number of things.
The Hall was a small atmosphere on the roof all the time.
That's a good idea.
Miro was a king, he played a good game too, Tuovinen said.
The previous season of the Silta in League was 2006-07, and then he won silver in the Pielavesi in Sammo, while he was the main coach at the time.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks's most effective at 14 points.
Mikkone again Akaa-Volley Star
During the 2012-13 League Score Exchange, Joni Mikkonen has started this season strongly.
The hakkur made 25 points when Akaa-Volley took its opening victory after losing Kokkola Tiikerit 3-2.
The season has started from its own place.
Today, of course, there was a loss close to us, since we had a fourth one on the 17-21.
There was some sort of win, and the fifth round came there at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few years ago, the most effective Tigers in the final match had made 28 points by the hammer Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported at 17 points.
There was not much to get into the guy's hammer, Mikkonen praised.
Finland compares human capital with the world’s first
Finland is at the top of the world’s human capital comparison, says Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the first of the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and Holland.
Later, Holland was placed on one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst in comparison.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health will be examined.
The World Bank has determined that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois held Atleticon in control, the local game ended in paintlessness
Real Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois went to exquisite tours, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a paintless match late Saturday in Spain's football league.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but the Belgian guard Courtois got to fight.
Courtois played at Atletico three times when he was a Chelsea player.
In the first week, the International Football Association Fifa chose him as a year's goalkeeper.
In real, the best goal was Gareth Bale, but his shot was directed by the end of the goal opening side.
After a break, Bale was switched for a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters screamed at Juvent the name of Cristiano Ronaldo.
In the United States, we are now attacking abortion rights - a powerful document tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to find out whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be chosen by President Donald Trump, Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive voice could be revoked by a decision known as Roe Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - the United States and abortion rights tells us how the current situation has come over over the years.
As incredible as it feels, the topic is topical in Finland as well.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has worked publicly against safe abortion and has received special support from the majority of representatives of our country.
At the beginning of the powerful document, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri.
The armed guard of the clinic says he is defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
The news videos remind us of the killings of the clinics.
Let's move to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Churches Association guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the interviewed pastor is good, but in fact, they are not even needed, the photo of the woman who died on an abortion itself is enough.
Deaths were in the United States about 5000 years.
The legalisation of abortions was defended in particular by the Republican Party.
In 1967, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan in California.
Later, in his 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan began to reversely mix religion with politics to the voters.
His abortion was also his successor George Bush's parents.
Donald Trump also did the same.
In the deepest core of the matter, the document will find a basis for the politicalization of abortion.
When tax liberty was denied from religious organisations that profited race separation, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a squirrel horse.
Religion has brought exceptional knots into politics.
In the U.S., there is a situation in which the sec was confronted by his sulical harassment but the voices of the religious right in his abortion has been elected by the president to the highest right to candidate Kavanaugh, which many women now accuse of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh can gain the power of the vase language position to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, among two children - at the border of great protests
Approximately 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year after Israel has fired protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday, the Ministry of Health of Palestinians says.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children: boys 12 and 14 years old.
According to the Minister, 505 people have been wounded.
89 of these bullets were wounded.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike on the border zone when demonstrators throw Israeli troops with stones and explosions.
The Army says he started using power to prevent protesters from breaking the border or trying to reach the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the Gaza protests since March, when the Palestinians began their weekly protests at the border.
According to the United Nations Human Rights Council, 12 000 people have been wounded.
The protesters demand access to Palestinian families, from which the Palestinians were forced to leave when the Israeli state was established in 1948.
Palestinian snipers have killed one Israeli soldier.
The explosives from the Palestinian sides and the Helium balls have lighted forest areas and farming lands in Israel.
Them Pukki got a punishment kick, he couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's top pair of Chey Dunkley seemed to have killed him with a bully in the punishment zone.
Separator Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the bucket was clean.
Them Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was going to be troubled by Judge Ward, who condemned Norwich at the 85th minute when Santa was defeated.
Ward showed me a bang of punishment, and Mario Vrancic shaken a 1-0 winning painting.
Santa has made five goals for Norwich in the Championship series.
The previous was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish breast muscle.
The job tasted like Puki again.
After she lost the ball, she continued until the end of the situation.
He created painting situations and defended unfairly.
Norwich had a five-week match.
The team will continue in the liigacup.
There's five wins in the back.
Assistance services for pedofils were completed immediately on bookings - in Finland about 40,000 people experience interest in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in adults.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
To date, sexually interested children or young people have been difficult to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Care Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was told in spring, the Sexpo e-mail and meeting times were booked very quickly, Yle said.
However, they are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a shame for many.
Most pedophilic emotions in themselves have not performed their fantasy and therefore did not commit any criminals.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that harass and depress them.
They also trouble normal life, says Yle, a sexual therapist, Patricia Thesleff, who works as a special expert in the project.
I think the work is valuable if one child saves from sexual violence, Thesleff says.
The leaders of the Koreans or a congo gynecologist?
As a winner of the United States President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites to win the prize.
Trump plays its role in reaching North Korea at least at the level of speeches to commit to nuclear warfare.
The biggest favorites of peace to Nobel are the Nobel receivers, according to the reports, South Korea President Moon Jae-in and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the Koreans is significant, since the last year there were sparks.
However, for years, the rewarding of Kim, leading to iron extracts, threatened and landed by nuclear weapons, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize recipients will be published from Monday, and on Friday the most important is the Peace Prize.
If the award is not given to the diplomacy of the Korean Peninsula, one of the top candidates is the congo doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a highly valued gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass abuse and has become a leading expert in the world.
Mukwege has given attention to sexual violence, which is a creepy side product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered to be the UN Refugee Organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has said that this year there are 331 candidates.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't hurt him if he had Nobel.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House if he thought he deserved a Peace Prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump said he smiled.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued to refer to the North Korea negotiations.
There are things that make Trump’s Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has often recognised people and organizations representing liberal democracy and a multinational world order - precisely the international cooperation that Trump has seen as opponents.
In the 2000s, three American politicians have received the prize: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Trump’s reward would therefore require the Nobel Committee an ideal full translation.
Fire notice in the tunnel: Automotives acted like fits and drove in the wrong direction
The first traffic chaos on Lohi took place on September 8.
The transport of the tunnel area was interrupted in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it turned out that it was systemic, the fire department tried to make traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Transport Center said that it could not be opened because the road has cars of the pig sock and they drive how it happens, the day friend of the firemaster Pasi Kääräinen told the STT at that time.
At that time, the motorway was driven in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow, Transport Safety Contact Manager Tapio Heiskanen is confused.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop as a compelling reason.
Transport security reminds us that in exceptional situations, transport cannot be compromised by urgent solutions.
Alert vehicles must always be made as unavoidable as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially prohibited, as well as making a U translation and withdrawal.
The same prohibitions are also valid in tunnels where, in addition, headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also prohibited, as is the case with parking.
There have been even cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, Heiskanen says in the Transport Safety Notice.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebration, even though the ship was caught on the bottom of the lake
The Ilves fans transported by M/S in Tampere would have wanted to stay on board to continue their winning party, even though the ship had caught its bowl on the bottom of the lake, said Juho Syrjä, who served at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, who traveled from the Hämeenlinna to Tampere, went off the route late Saturday night and got caught in the bottom of his bow on the Old Javed in Aka.
There were 19 passengers on board the ship and five crew members were evacuated at the mainland at night.
No one was injured in friends.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebration on the ship until morning, but of course, it was more reasonable to send them to the firehouse by car and bus at home, Syrjä said to STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to follow the Ilves and HPK match that ended with the 4-3 wins of Ilves.
According to the cyber, Saturday's hammer was due to the fact that the surface of the water was about half a metre lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, Navigation was also troubled by the fact that the nearest trajectory was covered by logs, and therefore its reflectors did not normally appear in the dark spring bridge.
No more mention of collision
Haveri happened on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalme shortly after the shipping route had lowered the bridge of the road between Tampere and Helsinki.
The major dramatics did not relate to the case according to Syrjä, as the ship’s speed was very low at the time of the event and the ground hit did not cause a more remarkable impact.
According to the cylinder, catching the bottom has not caused any leaks or pressures on the ship, and in these view, the cruises of the ship continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the divinger went to check the ship properly before the ship began to be pulled off the lowway.
We are still going to the shipyard to check that there was no damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that the next, next weekend in Tampere, cruise can be managed in a manner that is agreed.
The ship’s cruise season continues until the day of independence.
No use for ambulances
The rescue agency received an alert from the case on Saturday night after a little half-twelve.
In the viala port, ambulances were alerted to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Matti Willman said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions in the lake were difficult due to darkness and rather tough wind.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Service reported half after three Sunday nights that everyone on board had been evacuated and passengers were transferred to Tampere by bus.
The cruiser built in 1957 has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump’s candidate for harassment and drinking may be left out of the top job.
Brett Kavanaugh, presented as judge of the Supreme Court of America, may well remain unauthorized by the mission, assessing Mika Aaltola from the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the doubts have brought so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting another person.
At times in the United States, there have been many contradictions that the president’s candidate for the Supreme Court’s judge has raised.
In this case, the judge has usually withdrawn, says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to keep his face.
The appointment would be a hundred-democratic camp
The U.S. Supreme Court aims to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the choice of a new judge has become a politically highly sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, Aaltola says the decision is likely to rain the Democratic Party in the future interim elections of the Congress.
It would raise the vote among young people and women who would be more likely to vote on Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There is no chance of appointment for every term of presidentship, as in the United States the judges of the Supreme Court are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have left their own request for retirement at about 70-80 years of age.
Some of the Republicans hesitated the name
The U.S. Supreme Court’s candidates are usually subject to a background report, Aaltola says.
Even though Trump has only ordered a week's timeline for the FBI's supplementary report, it can still bring something important to Aaltola.
It can bring you.
Hardly there is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh’s fitness or inappropriateness to the office will be discussed brightly before the Senate decides.
The Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes in Senate, but at least two female republicans are suspected to take Kavanaugh's name.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be voted and the Republicans would lose.
She recognized Salisbury as a military intelligence agent
The Russian woman has told BBC to recognize Salisbury's poisons as a suspected Russian military intelligence agent.
On the basis of the photographs, she told me that it was a military intelligence in the GRU, Anatoli Tshepiga.
The Net Community of Bellingcat and the Russian community of Insider Russia have previously revealed one of the suspected men in Chepiga.
In the past, they said they found evidence that the current identity of men is cover-personal.
The group of BBC travelled to the village near the border of Russia and China, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman in the village recognized the images published by Tshepigan Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man from the British police photographs in which a man who now called himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russians are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok nerve poison in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been rewarded, among other things, in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspected GRU connection.
Men suspected of poisoning previously told the Russian television interview in September that he was in Salisbury as tourists.
Elders as throwing bags in the war reform
It has now been a living example of what the change of the war reform, defined by the Sipila Government, in practice, means.
My birth, the Vaala War services are produced by the Oulunkaari municipality, the former Regional Director of Attendo, appointed as Health Service Director in 2016.
The heads of the municipal association shall warn the delegation of the change limit.
If war expenditure is now increasing, the municipal government aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality frightened, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would stop the Department of Health and the Department of Institutional Management and Small Memory Diseases.
Domestic care would be added, which means long distances in Vaala, that older people living in remote villages will be retreated near the health centre to be treated as "home".
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay him customers.
The left of the whale did not swallow a bad preparation, but organized a good public meeting, with many of the family, close leaders, and also other parties.
I presented the war preparation on the dials, how old people in the Vaala municipality are already treated most at home in the whole of the Nordic country.
Carina West was also authorized by the neighbourhood.
The local newspaper made a big deal about the opportunity, and it brought the Oulunkare manufacturers backwards.
The warmakers do not write to any paper that Attendo has built a new home in Vaala, which is now waiting for people empty.
There are no other providers.
Preparers talk only about a service cell, but do not tell us the level of care they receive or in which staff structure Attendo will treat the elderly until the delivery.
Without a nurse?
In particular, the locations of the health centre will be discontinued because there is no doctor’s night-care.
Attendo will also take advantage of the doctors of the Vaala Health Center.
A whale example shows how central officials rotate the authorized indefinitely and the authorized are placed back against the wall with a change limit.
Thus, the Central Party will empty the people of Vaala, for who will remain there unsafe to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was it one of the election statements in the centre that the whole country was kept in residence?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a big mosquito in Cologne
In Germany, thousands of people in Cologne showed their minds when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Several hundreds of people had been gathered on the Rein River beach since the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read in the signs of protesters, and the attacks condemned fascist.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, several protests have been held and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
The supporters of Erdogan were also gathered near the Great Mosque.
However, the police had isolated the large area from the mosque for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised that his German visit had been successful and assessed to strengthen relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdoga met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild relations with countries that have significantly deteriorated since the Turkish Revolution Company in 2016.
Mr Merkel pointed out, however, that there are deep disagreements between countries, including with regard to human rights issues.
Reviews are surrounded by visits
Both Cologne City Director Henriette Reker and Nordrhein-Westfalen State Prime Minister Armin Laschet renounced their participation in the openings when their review for Erdogan’s visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student, Cansu, from Turkey, said he was coming to a demonstration against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go on the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, murdered and depressed.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last phase of the trip to Erdogan Germany, a significant proportion of the population in Nordrhein-Westfalen is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three accusations of the journalist's murder
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor told me that three people are accused of the gem murder of Kuciak and this engaged murder and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the investigation of the murder, but five of them were released.
Kuciak was found in February with his engagement in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between the politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police suspected the murders were involved in Kuciak's investigations.
The case and the article published by Kucia have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the distribution of the cattle on Sunday in dispersed areas
Due to the failure of the print, the Sunday Karelian is also forced to post as an addressless.
This may appear in the distribution of the magazine in decentral areas where distribution of joint boxes is required from external memory.
The situation was the same for the Saturday magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The post puts extra leaves in the county.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers are sent separately only on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
The journalist Arto Nyberg interviews today directly in his future discussion program, including Vesa Heilala.
Vesa is in the studio telling about the coming space trip he booked from Virgin Galactical in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which was required to pay as a bank loan.
If the original plans were correct, Vesa would have gone to space a while ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed by the year.
Now it seems that after an unhappy, accidental and death victim in 2014, things are in a hole.
If all goes well, commercial flights will continue to start this year or at the latest in the next year.
The number of the flight is 300, which means his trip is about a year away from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and the pressing state is 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells about the future website.
At the same address, he also backgrounds the need for space.
As a child, I read a comic magazine called Space Travel and saw a Star Trek series on TV.
The Star Wars have been seen, and that's what the idea left...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host.
Manchester City continued his lossless journey in Valioliiga, when it poured Brighton's landscape 2-0 on Saturday.
The sixth winners of the management champion team are Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct the fourth hit of the season from the near distance to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the back of the Brighton paint in 30 minutes.
Agüero raised his own painting score to five when he saw the Brighton Defense with Sterling in the 65th game minute.
The Argentinian was able to invest the punishment of the 2-0 end of the year easily.
The City, which started the season with six wins and one semester, leads the Valioliiga in the 19-point catches.
However, Liverpool, who played one less match, is only one point away.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night in its seventh round of matches to Chelsea.
The youth clubs chose the new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Societys elected new decision-makers for the next three years for 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen was elected Chairman and Vice-President Petra Mäkeläinen of Hämee.
The delegation was selected for 40 members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Societys will inform you on Sunday.
The meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural recreational activities to be known for quality and security.
The Youth Society Conference held in Joensuu gives three promises in its three-year activities: We keep the doors open to everyone, and we organise equal recreational activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we support volunteers and people on their own paths of growth, the Finnish Youth Societys tells us in their communication.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikö and confused Ferraria: "Got a very important driver"
In the Swiss Blick interview, the British Mersu was asked, he believes that Kimi Räikkösen's release from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the end of the period.
Hamilton leads Ferrar's second driver to Sebastian Vetteli at 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told me that Räikkönen would not continue in the cabinet for the next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton does not, of course, believe that Räikkönen would punch gloves into the dishes.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He's an extraordinary professional - a fantastic driver.
He stays one of my favorites and I'm convinced that Ferrari loses a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told me that Räikkönen has been one of his premieres.
I don't know if Kimi knew this, but when I was young and dreamed of formula one, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian part-session.
At 14 a.m., the Mercedes Valter Bottas leaves.
The afternoon will follow the race for a moment.
Football A-young SM series championship became a full farce: the opponent arrived only with 7 players
The highest serial level of football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Before 13:00, the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti Academy is enough for the first space in practice against Vasa IFK.
In order to turn into the last round, the Ilves in the second championship fight must win PK-35 and hope the Gulf loss.
However, the championship of the Lahtians was practically confirmed before the beginning of the banquet, as Vasa IFK had arrived at the Lahti with only seven players.
If there were one fewer, the game could not have been started.
The FC Lahti Academy won the 16-0 match.
During the break, the Gulfs led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the vast players is that the team has played in part with the same players in the A-youth SM series, i.e. the P20 series and the 2nd C block of men.
The left IFK has played in the second practice against the fall of the whole season.
In the second round of decisions, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK in a guest fight and hopes that Tampere United will lose his own visit to KuFua in the Siilinjärvi Tovala.
The car ended up at the roof of Eno, according to the rescue department, happiness was involved.
The passenger car went out of the road and ended up on the roof in Eno at the Juttuvaarant on Sunday at 9:00 p.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
The two of them were mildly injured, the rescue department reported.
Good luck was involved, the news says.
According to the Rescue Department, the road was wet from the rain.
The police department was at the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new ways to inquire: Equipment and recruitments already made, planning for abroad does not squeeze
According to Supo Chief Antti Pelttar, the intelligence law has been prepared by making equipment purchases and training staff.
As intelligence laws enter into force, the sum of the budget should continue to increase approximately EUR 10 million.
In the premises of the protection police (supon) located at the Helsinki Ratakadu, full decision is already being prepared to enter into force of intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, Supo's meeting manager, tells the West Media that equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams insists on a video where he sings in the topless, campaigning for the knowledge of breast cancer
Tennis's superstar Serena Williams meets again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing an Instagram account a video where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, says AFP.
The The Divinyls of the Australian The Divinyls was hit by I Touch Myself in 1991.
Williams supports the operation of the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to regularly perform own-activity checks," Williams wrote in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in an uncomfortable area, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of skin colors in the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it plays a lot of lives.
The Divinyls is the second author of Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
“He died of breast cancer, but gave us a slow ball to remind women to put their health first,” Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
The video comments praise Williams for courage.
Williams left out of Beijing's tennis tournament this week.
The background is in the U.S. open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams came to the main judge of the match and claimed, among other things, that men were accepted to be much more brutal than female players.
The Chinese restaurant with a mountain resort is not suitable for high-speed
In addition to traditional Chinese delicious landscapes, the restaurant serves great landscapes.
The Chinese province of Zhejiang has opened an exceptional restaurant.
It is literally located in the rock language.
You can look at the woods that spread below.
In the mountains of Longquan, restaurant visitors will be able to breathe in the mountains of Longquan.
Getting to the restaurant requires walking in the middle of peach trees.
The restaurant opened to travelers on 19 September8.
Youtube’s comments wonder where the restaurant’s toilet is located.

The collar ends today: This is how it all ends
Everything good ends in time.
This is what happens today to the domestic country drama of Corpela, which has been quite held.
The third production season has gone to hot stones: last week, 722,000 Finns looked on TV as their first show.
The peak figures no longer have any practical significance, since the Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkise series will not continue.
In the final period, the relationship between Jaska and Mirku is again taken forward with a ambition, and I think the mother of Jaska is the first to guess what to come.
Even between Anss and Miisa are the warmest, in the light of recent events, directly romantic, but then the patterns will appear again.
The police are also suspicious about the man of the luihu.
Still, no one knows the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, can hear amazing news.
The last will of the distance will come out, which will bring the woman to the edge of tears.
After a week, Sunday nights will continue for the newest period of Sorjone.
Today on TV1, I'm running a colonel at 21.05.
Do you want to go to work tomorrow in a small flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many lots of lots are staying home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should go to infection because the disease may be infectious even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes flu symptoms suddenly hit, sometimes they occur in skies.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms seem small, says Prevention publication.
Is it worth staying home?
Prevention suggests that flu is contagious even when a person has no symptoms.
The virus is already infected by a day before the symptoms begin and from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough squeezes and there is no fever anymore, says professor Gregory Poland.
It is also worth avoiding training.
Too fast to return to the gym slows the recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, throw them in a handcuff and throw them in a garbage.
But hurting to move?
If you have to leave the home sick, consider using the protective mask.
Maski does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
The fingers will not be placed in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
The evaporations are also limited to the mask.
How can the infections be avoided?
The best way to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland reiterates the missile tradition: "My husband is a ice hockey player"
Ice hockeyer and missiles are often connected.
This also happened at Alina Voronkova, 23th.
In 2018, the crown of Miss Finland has been received by Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
Beauty now lives in the Bay, where he moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is an inkerinish and his father is Russian.
The Russianity of the father Voronkova was bullyed at school.
My mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was tempted because of my Russianity.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends, Alina tells Miss Finland in the semifinalist publication.
After the upper grade, Alina decided to start from a clean table and change the Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, a missile nurse found new friends, and the ark went rolling hopefully.
At the age of 15, he thinks he's an adult, but I wasn't really thinking afterwards.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who was familiar with Pelicans.
After a SM-liiga career, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was in the Finnish team at the MMs of 18-year-olds.
In the early days of dating a couple or almost a year of distance, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into a winner's three and with that, I would have a career, I don't want to believe that it would have any effect on our relationship.
Even if we have to live separately, we have confidence in a well-functioning relationship, and the good part of the distance is that it stays on top of the entire time, Alina sparked in May.
Continuous growth gladly, death with our guts
Nearly everyone is concerned about the durability of the earth.
But there is nothing they want to give up.
Sustainable options are being sought for continued growth, but the theory of reasonable economy is also facing major problems.
During a few generations, the continued growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern side of the ball, the level of living that could only be dreamed before.
However, the long-standing crossing of the Earth’s capacity and climate change will cause this market economy to deteriorate threateningly.

The older men have already been out of the hospital.
The police have captured one person whose possible contribution to the stabbing will be investigated.
The police are also looking for another suspect related to the events.

One of the defensive mistakes took us a full score, Allen troubled us.
Again we were the best!

The newspaper showed its subpower skills, the playground is not sure yet
The strong underpower game of Jori Lehtera emerged when his NHL-seura Philadelphia Flyers played his last practice before the beginning of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehtera feeds Michael Raffl twice to paint.
Last few days, Lehter has been present because of drug suspicions.
On Wednesday, MTV told me that Lehtera is one of 23 suspects in a drug mix that is suspected of drug use and is part of sales, for example.
The newspaper has denied that he committed a crime.
The company and the player have discussed the matter, and the NHL is investigating the case.
The journalist of the Philadelphia Inquirer closely followed by the Flyers, Sam Carchidi, considered that Lehter was part of six attackers, of whom five will be placed in the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehterä was excellent at the gym.
In the second round, Lehter fought the hose with subpower, pulled the defender against him and fed him to the opening place of Raffl waiting for the goal.
For the second time, the twin co-operation brought the goal right at the end of the match.
Flyers will start the NHL on 4 October with a guest fight against Las Vegas.
In Boston, the defender Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's training management solution to see if he can join the NHL group.
I think the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coachs decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for NHL, Vaakanainen said in an interview published on the Boston Twitter account.
In the riverboys, the Vaakanay played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
At the Boston painting, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and refused 20 times.

The fresh picture looks like a change: The strongest man in the world weighted tens of kilos
In 2017, Eddie Hall, the world’s strongest man, is going through the glittering change of shape.
The British Eddie Hall hunted the title of the world’s strongest man for a long and determined period of time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 pounds of food per day and weighed 200 pounds in size according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were 5XL.
Hall admitted to damage to his body before I won the title.
The human body has not been created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted the victory of the world’s strongest man race in every way and the family man promised to terminate his career if I had a title.
Hall didn't want his children to grow without his father.
Hall kept his promise, and he was no longer seen in April, the strongest man in the world in 2018.
Instagram, in fact, the Hall released a picture where he pose a lot more actively.
Hall writes its current weight is 169,5 pounds.
Hall wrote to practice five times a week.
The programme includes, among other things, boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall takes four exercises a week at the gym.
In this year, the strongest man in the world was the puneric of Iceland, the Game of Thrones TV series, known as Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson.
The previous Finnish winner of Kisa is Janne Virtanen, who was the first in 2000.
The restaurant ship M/S Tampere shook a cave in the Holy Lake - "Strengtheningly catching a rock coke"
Inland watercraft M/S Tampere drove to the beach late Friday night at the Akaa Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue facility was alerted from the water traffic accident on Friday night after half twelve.
A 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has gone to the cave, and is strongly attached to its sculpture with a rock, described by a day-old firemaster Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue agency, the victims were avoided.
The passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated on the continent from the ship.
Now they are transferred by bus searching towards Tampere, told the head of the daycareman Jari Nieminen STT at 1:00 a.m.
In the viala port, ambulances were alerted to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, a ship from the Hämeenlinna to Tampere had fled from the route on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalme.
The police will find out the reason for the events.
Matti Willman told me earlier in the evening that the conditions in the lake are difficult because of darkness and quite hard wind.
According to the rescue agency, the ship's fate is unclear.
The ship is not flooding.
After the evacuation operation, the divingers will start to check what the situation is on the ground.
The M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is currently an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship, with the maximum number of passengers of 180 people.
There is also a meeting room for private use on board.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The weather forecast of the day is avoided.
This is the weather forecast of this and tomorrow.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Robert Helenius's night fight against Erkan Teber is shaking money.
Ilta-Sanoma news today about Jaakko Helminen and Vice-President Jussi Kokkila's application for a challenge in which Helenius will be charged with a total of EUR 80 000 unpaid manager fees.
According to the challenge request, Helmine and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to reconciliate, but there's no other option.
Here has been a clear mandate, and the work has been done very much, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanom.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to the evening magazine, which tells the poker's view of the events.
Helenius denies to be obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the report, Kokkila and Helmine had provided their services in a financially bad situation for Helenia and promised to arrange for him matches and sponsor income.
It was agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay the fees for only percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius does not have to pay anything, only to receive the revenues they have organized.
This is also a normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
The wage work has never been agreed and would have been insane in the situation of Helenius, Sundman will find out in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to his reply, Helenius would have wanted to agree in writing on the distribution of income, but Kokkila and Sundman only received the draft at the end of 2014.
He pointed out the proposal on his own and broke cooperation with Kokkila and Helmi.
Helenius did not fight once when he was in contact with Kokkila and Helmi.
A year after the end of the co-operation, Helenius had been shown to be an unspecified but measurable bill of the manager’s work.
This year, the cover has been raised with the same arguments.
Helenius believes that Helmis and Kokkila’s afterhand activities are poor, the answer says.
Helenius meets today the IBF's heavy series of challenging list seventh in the Erkan Teper Stuttgart.
Heartful Man and Good Supplier
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio felt the last radio driver and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
A long line radio driver and journalist Erkki Päll died at the age of 83 from unremedible liver cancer.
The death notice of the runner was published on Sunday at the Helsingin Sanom.
The announcement says Päll died on September 3.
Päll told me about a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication also saw Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the familiar fate.
He left on Facebook before as good-bye, Ile Vainio says.
Justio thinks Erkki Päll is a multi-sponsor, who became a great journalist.
He remembers the man who was held by Päll with fast hoksoes and fun things.
I learned to know Erk as a little boy when I first went to the Finn Disc at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouse.
We met Erk at the time.
He was the informant of the Finn Disc and in various tasks, Ile Vainio remembers.
When I went to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Päll was a standard editor in all the events of artists.
He was always expert and I saw how big a fire he had for entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly to the skin of his interviewers.
He was a hearty man and a good journalist.
For many, he was known as a highly respected Yle's radio driver, but he also wrote great magazine stories.
Erkki interviewed me several times.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli also worked in a Fazer disc company with Hope Kärje.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
But the biggest passion of the ball was radio work in which he had a unique style.
Since the 1960s, he did radio work, and he became familiar with numerous listeners in the Yle ether.
He retired in 1998.
On Saturday, the Finnish Skiing Association announced that the financial year ended in May showed about 450 000 euros of profits.
The federation describes the "extending translation" of its economic situation, although the economy is stressing "the significant debt in the balance".
Mika Kulmala, CEO, praises rapid response and severe economic discipline.
In the last autumn, we have responded to the situation as quickly as possible by taking adaptation measures.
The activities of careful planning and economic management have collapsed through our entire organization, Kulmala says in the newsletter.
We have also succeeded in partnering, and in addition, the world cupin yield was maximal in the past competition period.
However, in the future, the management of costs must be accurate, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financial models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of the hospital Please in the island of Sulawes in Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area that has been collected for the assessment of the need for injured survivors and treatment.
Patients are also treated outside due to extinction.
One of those moving in the hospital area was a 52-year-old returner of Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him when he was going to school, Baharuddin told the news office to AFP.
The Army Hospital's courtyard in Palussa lay at Dwi Haris, who has had injuries in his back and arm.
He was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to the return wedding party.
I was probably under the wall that collapsed.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe, and Haris told the news agency AP according to the British Timedies.
Small shops are robbed
Please, at the evacuation center, a 35-year-old baby's mother, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm down his hot baby.
He described the atmospheres in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are robbed everywhere, said Kusuma.
Many Please have slept outside or in temporary bamboo areas.
Even if the house would somehow be able, possible retardations could destroy it permanently and bury the residents.
According to AP, more than half of the prisoners in prison ran away after the prison walls collapsed.
The prisoners were known to be around 560, so there may be around 300 refugees.
Some of Donggala's prison prisoners have also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners raged and burned the jail after the guards had refused to go to search for their relatives suffering from earthquake and tsunami.
Please, the airport has been reopened mainly for aid flights.
In the first place, the military C-130 transporter landed on the field, which brought supplies.
Commercial flights Please allow the field to be limited only.
The pilots are forced to land on the field without the help of the flight manager, as the flight control tower was damaged in the earthquake.
The rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long rain area spreads across the country on Sunday night from the west direction, says the Air Science Institute.
The rain comes mostly as a water, but in Central and North Lappi there is a expectation of storm or snow.
The last night’s baggage packs are not repeated because the temperatures below the cloud cover remain higher.
The cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures quite effectively in control.
Just in the west, you can instantly visit the pack side, said the day friend of the meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain area is stretched in the east through the morning.
In the south and western, there are clouds or clouds.
In the afternoon, the temperatures always move up to the height of Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week looks similar in the south and middle parts of the country, but the weather becomes more stable.
The sea areas have wind and wave warnings.
Real storms are not expected for the next few days, but otherwise there is a typical autumn variable weather.
The autumn starts to wear it seriously, Ilkka said.
Miss Finland Final is not seen on TV
From the IL TV, you can follow the red carpet glamour and rays of Miss Finland.
In the IL-TV, the entertainment journalists take a direct shipment from the red carpet Billnäs in the Miss Finland Final.
The shipment begins at 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned from the ten finalists on Saturday.
Miss Finland 2018 Final will be visited in the Billnäs rucket at Raasepor.
Before the final begins, you will be able to follow the atmosphere at the IL-TV live broadcast.
The live broadcast starts at about 6:30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, a lot of Miss Finland winners have been invited to the final.
They are represented by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus in 1998.
Other judges are the welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen, and Katja Lintunen.
We hoped he could go to the university before he went to the missiles.
The Russian Dimitri father and the Indian Svetlana mother believed their daughter’s success at the Miss Finland Final.
In recent Miss Finland Alina Voronkova parents Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova were proud of their daughter’s first moments in the crown.
They came to the public from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result began to get excited, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an angel and a Russian dimitri.
Alina speaks smooth Russian, even though he has lived throughout his childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than the career of Miss.
Alina was often told that when she's so pretty, she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio driver.
Only later, Alina was excited about beauty competitions.
The parents wanted Alina to be at the university before attending the Miss Finland competition.
This was the case, and ultimately Alina wanted to do a degree before the missiles.
Last year, we asked why he didn't participate, but he wanted to finish the cover.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He has a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be present, it appears.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri hockeys in Japan and couldn't encourage Finland to love in the final.
Alina’s parents believe that the relationship of young people lasts a year.
Yes, that's what it's supposed to be!
The parents were hoping that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
It's been a long break in visits because of missile speeds.
I'm sorry, even though there are messages.
A young man died in the Lahti, the police arrested three people.
According to the police, three people have been captured after the incident.
On Saturday, the police did not comment on the course of events, nor the possibility of overstripping the intention to complete the investigation.
Also, the police did not comment on whether the arrested persons and the dead man knew each other from their former.
More information about the case can be found at the beginning of the next week.
Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a homemade in Finland - remembered the idea of a cartoon: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
In the meantime, my husband left from the record where he suggested it to the story I developed as a person, the espoolaic comic blogger, homemade and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says he was a EU translator in economic and legal matters in Brussels until he became a returning family ten years ago after the fourth child.
I've been enjoying myself as a home mother.
This has been the best time in my life, but at some point it reminded me of what it would do when the smallest child started to be big.
Then in 2014, there was a comic.
Piippo says he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read the Aku Ankka, Tintti, and Asterix when he was little.
I had drawn it when I was a child, but when these Nature manuscripts began to come up then, the situation changed.
At first, I made a few dozen scripts in the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skillful drawer, but I couldn’t get him in the mood until summer 2016 when I gave Hivs with a drawing plate.
Her enthusiasm lasted a dozen strips, and then she had to start trying, laughing at Piippo, who says the drawing plate was a great stimulant to her.
The drawing plate is an easy and convenient tool trying to get something early.
I didn’t even try to draw the paper, tells Piippo about his relationship to draw what he usually does in the evening.
Handwriters are constantly reminded of, but usually I do not prepare at once.
One of the three square strips takes even more hours.
I may make a screen at a time and enjoy playing with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates the modern series of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
As individuals of the organic cows, a carrot mother who has a salad leather.
Other people are Male, Pissis and twins.
In the world of organic nuts, man is what he eats.
The ideas of a series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a forced bubble, even though it is intruded between us.
Piippo tells me that he reads his series with his husband and children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon and say that I've done this today.
And there are many challenges for your mother!

Indonesian earthquake: The Flying Director sacrificed himself - he did not leave a cracking tower until he got hundreds of passengers safe.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old airline leader, has become a hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung stayed alone in the airline tower until hundreds of people were safely transported from the island that was shaken by the earthquake.
The young man was in turn in the flight management of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city when the earthquake hit on Friday.
When others fled from the airline, Agung refused to leave the place before he got directed from the Batik Air passenger plane to the air.
Thus, he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation administration told the AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The flight control tower was vacuuming and cracking.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he got serious internal injuries.
Agung was sent to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported to a helicopter’s better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, the aeronautical representative told the Jakarta Post.
The incision continued to increase the flight to reach the air, and its strength was eventually measured by 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
Indonesian aviation administration has respected the heroism of Agung in social media.
Rehn was thinking about the end of Europe to trade war: "We need to watch the next tweet"
The US-China trade war reflects the whole world economy.
In all Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and the Bank of Finland has slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
In Yle’s first position, CEO Olli Rehn said that even though exacerbating tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to exports from Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is very much for now.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and contribute to restoring the situation with China and Japan.
In the opinion of Rehn, Europe does not seem to be stirring in the legs of the trade war.
We need to look at the next tweet and then evaluate the tweet.
We have an unpredictable partner in Washington, but he said in the interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of these is the third largest economics in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most obligatory countries in the euro area and the whole Western world.
Yesterday, the market reacts dramatically to the deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday night.
The next year’s deficit is more than 2.4% of the population.
Rehn thinks the situation in Italy is worrying.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem credits and unregarded credits are more than 10 per cent.
In addition, its public economy is in weak positions and the country seems to be going beyond its commitments in relation to its European partners.
There may be no need to paint new crises yet, Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy would bring it to a new economic crisis in Europe.
The second issue in Europe is the difference between the UK and the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be in harmony.
The difference would be much more negative.
Rehn started as Director of the Finnish Bank in July.
Mario Draghi, Director-General of the European Central Bank (ECB), withdraws his duties in a fair year.
The debate on his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liiase has been curious in speeches.
I don't think it's okay if the Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he's not going to comment on this further.

The missing mushroomer was found as a "preliminary experiment"
Drone skills from the Finnish police are the world’s top: “We are asking for training.”
According to the police university's director, the police can use the drone in addition to searching for lost people, for example in criminal investigations and intelligence.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a drone of the lost fungus in Raaha only in a few minutes.
The police university director Kimmo Himberg referred to the case and mentioned, among other things, that “with the help of unprecedented experimentation and effective training, we are also the top of the world.”
Drone is quite new and the newer in police duties.
There is no statistics that the Finnish police are the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong idea that this is.
This has occurred, for example, when Finnish police experience has been reported in international events.
There is a terrible interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be a hard time for visitors to watch the Finnish police drone.
We are asked for training.
More and more common
Himberg recalls that finding lost in winter as soon as possible is very important.
As stated, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found using a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they are meant to be trained more.
Now, the drone is used in police tasks a lot, and the use of them will increase and increase in the future.
This is how I dare to say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for missing people, the police may use drones, for example, in the investigation of accidents or crime scenes and specific intelligence tasks.
For example, we already need to check some area a little further, which may be afraid that there is violence.
Drone can be used for pre-information.
Karjalan Rugby
Karjalan Rugby celebrates the victory of the 2nd division on Saturday in Kuopio.
The Joensuuans were still at the mid-second of the match for the Helsinki Rugby Club, but they found a plot in the second episode and whispered the Southern guests to 26-12.
The 2nd division championship, at the same time, knew Karelia Rugby had historic rise to the 1nd division.
Previously, the club has played in the first, but at that time the Finnish rugby serial activities were divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-party 1 divisions.
The club is going to accept a serial site, but it knows quite a job next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players must be grown to 25.
The 1 division also knows the growth of the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the purchase of money must also be consistent with it.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, strengthens the main coach
At the Ice Hockey NHL, Montreal Canadiens' chief coach Claude Julien confirmed the company on Twitter that the Finnish winner Jesper Kotkaniemi began the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise in Kotkaniemen, 18, with the first round number of three summer reservations.
The attacker joined Montreal’s training strength from the end of the summer and has presented strong extracts in September’s exercise matches.
The cotkaniemi managed to make a goal in his first training match.
The main coach Julien praised the major progressive steps of the Finn after the arrival of the incoming camp.
The NHL frame series begins next Thursday night against Finland's time.
Montreal meets at the opening round of Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
This week, Finland has spoken a lot about leadership.
Risto Siilasmaa, President of the Government of Nokia, said in the interview with HS, a Paranoid optimist in which he lights his leadership philosophy.
At the same time, he criticizes his predecessor Jorma Ollila's leadership.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but in previous Nokia reports, there has been talk about the inability of leaders to act as a team; fear and speechlessness in which mobile business collapse was caused.
The company’s rising risk and sensitivity disappeared.
In Helsinki, the Nordic Business Forum also held a business event, which attracted the cream of Finnish business life to the Fair Center.
In addition to Barack Obama, there were 12 business stars.
That's enough of a good lead.
Gary Hamel, the legend of leadership, said that a good leader must be dared to bring the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are spiritually most linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of the Whole Foods trading chain known from a wide range of organics, said that the manager must be able to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that does not mean to just win for owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote the success book about the introverts, said that the most successful leaders are inquireably humble.
They act calmly, quietly and determinedly.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance, recalled that the characteristics of a good manager must be hit in one with the company’s life cycle.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A mature company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These teachings in Nordic Business Forum listened to 7 500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
As a threat, they had a threat to information.
A good leader requires a lot.
That is why leadership is so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other in the colonels.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders of Nokia at the right time.
Their humility was not easy to evaluate.
Sara Chafak arrived in a fantastic red carpet directly from Los Angeles to spend most of his years abroad.
The model Sara Chafak arrived at the Mission Final in a fantastic black dress.
In the 2012 Miss Finland's show-up dress, there was also a lace.
A little jet lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, and Chafak tells me what he was talking about.
Chafak says he's in Los Angeles.
He has made advertisements, among other things.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to Finland.
However, he says that work needs to be done more harder, because the model is always a replacement.
You have to dress harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

The Danish police found a big Volvo in the operation: "We can't tell you where."
The Danish police’s extensive search has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, the traffic was closed on the bridges of the Jewish Rauma and Ison-Belt.
All land and ferry transport from the island of Själlan was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the head of the Copenhagen Police Media Center.
The searched car has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found, Henrik Storm from Copenhagen's police informs the Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo is not directly connected to the threat.
He said the biggest danger was over.
The Danish Extra Bladet told the police about Saturday's information conference.
Inspector Jørgen Bergen Skov was from the expense of the silence operation.
He didn't want to tell me what a criminal name it was being investigated.
Skov said it was a serious crime.
It was a threat to the lives of people.
The operation has been searched for three people.
The police won't tell me if they're already captured.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been canceled.
The Copenhagen Police also followed the events with their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, there is no reason for the public to worry anymore because the threat was targeted by certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of divergence - now the people will vote on the disputed elections
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on the proposal for a new name of the country.
According to the Treaty of Macedonia and the Greek Governments, the Republic of North Macedonia will be named.
Greece has so far blocked its veto law on Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name of Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The issue of the referendum does not mention a new name, but it is asked whether the voter is in favour of the EU and NATO membership of Macedonia by accepting the agreement.
The vote began verbally at least at a school in the centre of the capital of Skopje.
A retired nurse, Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at school, hoped to support the agreement.
The referendum is a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
This means a change, especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contacts.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the agreement.
The National Rights opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a boicot to vote.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see whether the vote will increase by 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of yes votes would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
A majority of the two-thirds of Parliament is needed to change the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament must also accept the agreement.
Voting sites will be closed from eight o’clock in Finland.
A handsome win!

Canada fights time to achieve harmony with Nafta with the US
Time threatens to end in negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a back limit on Sunday, and the negotiators of the countries have been discussing closely throughout the weekend.
Canada’s main negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus on trade negotiations in full.
President Donald Trump's request from the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement with Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States agreed with each other, but the agreement with Canada has not yet been established.
The United States and Mexico want to enter into force the agreement before the Mexican presidential elections won Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador enter their office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada’s participation in the contract is not necessary.
He has previously informed the Congress that the plans have to sign the agreement at the end of November - was in Canada or not.
As a result of these schedules, the United States-Canada Agreement text should be prepared on Sunday in order to provide sufficient time for the United States Congress to evaluate it.

Students show rare deliciousness: ancient tragedy - redeemed Oresteia affects their visuality
Antique tragedies are rarely delicious in Finnish scenes.
For example, the National Theatre has last been seen in the ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Philoktetes, in 1988.
Now, the Theatre University brought to a tour from the National Academy, the only whole of ancient play trilogy, Aiskhylos Oresteia.
In the 2015 stages open! projects, actress students at the Theatre University work internationally with the professional director.
The director of this fourth project, as the first one, is Mikko Roiha in Berlin.
Oresteia was awarded an international premiere in Berlin in April.
The Reconciliation of Roiha from Oresthesia summarises the report of the end of the family of Athreus and the birth of the rule of law for a valuable period of two decades of minutes, in particular by consolidating the choir shares.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuure’s fine Finnish (2003).
The dramatic lights and the theatre’s pages revealing presentation highlight the frightened and bright stage thinking.
Its center is interchangeable with the dynamics between the choir and the choir of the performers who are departing from the choir.
The presentation uses both double and triangle seats for title roles.
The actresses do not leave the scene at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon returning from the Trojan War and this war hall of Kassandra will be shown on the scene, unlike the tradition of the ancient presentation.
Of course, the presentation does not underline being loyal to the ancient tradition.
Rather, before the eyes of the viewer, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has been able to get a close group of actors out of the Master’s stage, directly as a single body, a number of rhythms.
Especially in the choir sections of very expressive, sculptured group formations, adhesive actors will be able to access their rights on the bare, only by decorating, decorating, decorating the white front.
That's impressive.
The Orestheia show will continue to the Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.

The fists flipped several times in Kajaan
A little more than 30-year-old man assaulted three men at a restaurant in the center of Kajaan and at the front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit a man inside the restaurant, and he was removed from the place.
In the outside, he pushed another man on the ground, and, in the absence of a third man, the assault hit him.
The police caught the assassin.
At the police station, the man still acted aggressively and kicked another policeman on his feet.
The man also threatened the police by assaulting and killing.
The man was taken to the jail to calm down.
The issue is being examined as three assaults and the violent opposition of the official.
In the center of Kajaan, there was also another incident of assault on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
At first, about 20-year-old Kajaan man hit the victim.
A little later, the other man smashed him on the ground and the previously hit the victim again.

However, the authors were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police are asking witnesses of the event to contact Kajaani Police by phone 0295 416 520 or by email to investigate.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long Line Radio Driver Erkki Päll is dead
As a long-term journalist, Erkki Päll died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio transmitter Erkki Päll, 83, is dead.
He died of unremedible liver cancer on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, it's going now.
Even the doctor has said that, I live a day at a time, he commented on his situation to the evening newspaper a month ago.
The security of astronomers and astronomers must be guaranteed
The first time I got paid in 1984.
When a matter of this year’s tyre is amazed, it’s usually a big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the security of retail workers, I was surprised and even a little angry at some point.
I also spoke to the case by the Professional Association of Services (PAM), Erika Kähärää.
He says criminal statistics don’t tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers say otherwise.
The police are only aware of the serious cases and many of the real violence situations are not reported.
“Yes, of course, companies have a duty to statistics on their situation in close proximity based on the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics remain available in internal use and their data are not collected anywhere,” he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in statistics.
In violence situations, there has always been a problem that they do not always produce physical injuries.
Psychic traumas can be much more serious, however, than bruising and wounds.
The difference between the violent situation and the threat of violence is difficult to draw, when a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if they do not have access to violence.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even though they do not do what they do.
Some areas of residence are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
When the opening hours were released, the media had a fairly high impact on the safety of the sellers.
“At that time, many employers arranged security services for at least night hours and to prevent working alone,” Kähäkkä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is made.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this produces a new negative trend.
Because of the security, the disruptions were well held, it was a imagination that the security would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to find solutions that could remove expensive security services.
A mild assault is a prosecutor crime, and it is quite understandable that the seller who has been assaulted does not want to make an investigation request for a criminal who usually lives in the store.
However, according to the provisions of the 2011 Act, a mild assault becomes subject to the prosecutor if it takes place at the workplace.
I think there's a need for preliminary cases.
The next time aunt or uncle is abducted, the police should investigate and accuse the prosecutor.
When the court puts a few assaults in prison, and the judgement from the hard to get to the punishment scale, the customs would be cleaned.
A society in which food trade should be open for about a night in small municipalities must ensure the safety of workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed up for Miss before the beginning of the direct shipment - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
The crowning of Miss this year is not seen in a traditional way on TV, but the broadcast will show the Viafree site.
The shipment is run by the former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and the host of the NHL and KHL studios of Viasat and Viaplay.
Backstage and the red carpet runner is Janni Hussi.
Before the direct shipment, the host three told the invited guests and media representatives about the cost of the shipment.
At first, Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjula a new applause.
Now all women scream!
Look at this male jury, Sohlberg shouted his colleagues at the hurrage.
There are many previous years in Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to us and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg was blocked looking towards Saros.
Sohlberg was more likely to refer to the divorce of Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, even though it initially seemed confused.
The first time he spoke of his divorce in the evening-sanoma weekend.
Missikaunotar said that he did not want to open the reasons for the difference in the public, because it is a matter between him and Roope Salmis.
He said he was not busy with a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I am focusing on my own things, and in particular I am living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
The marriage status of Harjula emerged at a later stage when Sohlberg accidentally mistaked to call Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula couple.
The runner's three laughed.
I was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi's bankrupt.
The Northman tortured the tied to his open side by cutting, burning and feeding a powerful sauce
A 34-year-old man who lived in Kokkola has been sentenced to a number of offences committed by his open spouses for three years in prison.
The crime tool was, among other things, a belt, cable and cable ties.
The court condemned these objects as lost to the state.
Rank's prosecution was a suspect of rape.
However, the Court of Justice of this prosecution rejected.
The reason for the cooko was four assaults, gross assaults, forces, illegal threats, liberty violations, brutal liberty violations, and two destructive acts.
The crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the last act, the man was arrested and arrested a few days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the Court of Justice of the Northeast gave its judgment and ordered a 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also accused of two brutal liberty violations and of the brutal rape of May 22.
However, these accusations were rejected as unseen.
The case was discussed in court behind closed doors.
However, the judge gave a public statement on the judgment.
According to the judge, the accused had targeted violence, threats and forces of their spouses in situations in which this had been tied.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, burned with a cigarette, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
The court ordered the state to lose criminal means: belt and cable, cables, bath belt, knife and vess.
Four Witnesses
According to the law of the visitor, the parties continued to live together between the actions.
It is possible to read that a large part of the most brutal actions took place at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A 34-year-old person must pay compensation for pain, sorrow, suffering and temporary harm in total EUR 5800.
He hardly has these money, because the convicted already have debts in heritage.
Prison is not the first man.
The afternoon does not give a convicted name to protect the privacy of the victim.
The recent jury is not lawful when writing this.
Europe in the Management of Four Points for Ryder Cup
On Saturday, European golf professionals captured their leadership in a traditional game of holes against the United States.
Europe leads Ryder Cupia to 10-6, when there are still 12 double games in front of us on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four games that started on Saturday, and in the afternoon's four-day game, the winnings were equalized to 2-2.

No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and the Americans have not been able to play like three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the brutal harassment of his supporters in the Honka game: "The Violence is not part of football"
Football betting team HJK published a newsletter on Sunday in which it condemns its supporters' disruption in the Saturday FC Honka game in Tapiola.
“We call for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters,” the newsletter says.
After the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters went to the field and some appeared to challenge the dispute with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The orderers did not get the situation to calm down, they needed police and horse police.
HJK tells us when informing us that team players and staff are shocked about what happened.
After the match, the events are not consistent with the values of our traditional 111-year-old companion.
“We express steeply away all the activities that jeopardize the safety of the matches,” the Communication says.
The HJK promises to help authorities and organisers in identifying safety-threatening factors and eliminating mild effects.
Support culture is part of football and important to HJK.
We all support positive, happy and encouraging activities in football views.

Filipino inventor flies with a drone car - so avoid traffic congestion
Mendiola is a philippinian inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He now belongs to a growing crowd in the world who swears he invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As a competitor, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has used a large part of his property to build his dreams.
He started the development of his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he said he made the first successful test flight - he flagged his device at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device will trigger positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Tomorrow, work fights will appear in children’s day care and social and health services
In the public and well-being sectors tomorrow, over-work and exchange bans will begin, in particular, in social and health services, as well as in children’s day care, assess the JHL’s President Day Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be broad, and they will certainly appear in such a way that there is not enough staff in place.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their children.
The employer’s task is now to make sure that services play and no one’s spirit is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of workers also appeared at the beginning of the year when JHL members were in an over-work and exchange ban due to contractual negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through the flexibility that the staff has not been hired, but that workers have remained in overtime or exchanged shifts.
This is not yet a work fight.
It is a standard for working safety that, for each employee, regular working hours are kept and made only of them.
The JHL objects to the government's intentions to reduce the protection of dismissal of small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, Head of Labour of Municipal Employees, will not pre-evaluate the impact of over-work and exchange bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very mutilating, even though services can weaken.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and made the preparations to do.
The area is so extensive, social and health activities and the technical sector that is difficult to say.
Effects can vary very much by industry, by region and employers, Jalonen said to the STT.
Jalonen says that last week there was already experience of the activities of the Super and Social and Health Organization of the Neighbourhood and Fundamental nurses, including the three-day activities of Tehy.
Their effects were quite limited.
The JHL’s ban on overworking and exchanges applies, inter alia, to municipalities, churches, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family daycare nurses are excluded.
At this stage, there are nearly 100,000 members of the JHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may last long.
The Union has also prepared for other work struggles if the preparation of the termination law continues.
The government should now admit that it runs into the wall and hard.
In the view, both the Ay movement and the government have to come against.
It’s special that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the show has not been given yet, Jalonen updates.
The great Korallirity is born with the strength of children and adults - in the fitness circles of the presentation, studying Rail and Sea Horse gestures
In other spaces, the College of Great Koralliriutta received its first night last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday it was played twice in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Koralliritus is a work that will be built from the beginning to the end, together with the public.
However, this time a clearer proposal is also being built, which refreshes and stresses the findings made in the initial exercises.
The theatre game is enough of the sauce of magic for children as well.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparatory phase of the work.
However, the great Korallirity is not a child's presentation, but a presentation made by adults and children in collaboration.
It provides adults with information and observations about children’s ways to receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into practice and joint cuts also dilute the distance between adults and children.
The great coral resembles some kind of satubalet, fitness and nature-related information attack, but it will ultimately be put in different, non-human living areas around visits.
The great coral rice begins to explore the movements of coral and coral ribs of living organisms and fish.
In six different fitness circles, we learn, among other things, Rail and Sea Horse gestures.
Finally, a little less than an hour-long show where music, lights and shiny paints and costumes help to get to know the life of the corallor.
There are both diverging people in the Great Koralliruta who observe the life of the coral rib and the corals that are viewed.
There are also bodies that look at the corals.
The eyes and observations pointed in many directions make the presentation dense and life flourishing.
Whether it is a landscape of some organism, a landscape-seeing organism, and a second body or landscape that looks at the body - and all this at the same time.
It doesn't seem to be difficult for children.
In other spaces, the group aims to pursue the limit of thinking and action, which is challenging when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, Sitrator will hold a quiet demonstration on behalf of the threatened corals.
The damage beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, even though it might be difficult to understand what the significance of self-consciousness is now in front of the prospects of destruction.
In other areas, it has built its work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life as well as with political gestures.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of consciousness, other species, and future generations of them, whose wonder and play it cleans space.
The children grow up too fast - I'm happy that my childhood had no smartphones.
Today’s children and young people are more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking while younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and they should not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex, because others say so.
I was curious when my friend told me that he had to pick up his fifth grade sister from "boyfriend".
When she came to get her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experience that night.
I can’t imagine my own sister in the same situation because we’ve been told and warned throughout our childhood that the drug should not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope today’s children can live a proper childhood, and they wouldn’t have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I constantly see younger girls in Instagram who are in their pictures of makeup on their faces and reveal clothes on their heads.
Snapchat is used in the evening for taking and sending photos.
It is even more difficult to guess what age they are.
Today, 13-year-olds can easily look 18-year-old and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad my childhood had no smartphones.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn’t have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: The authorities told the government that the case Airisto Helmi is not related to national security
According to the Ilkka Kanerva interviewed above, the defence police and defence forces went to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that the investigation of the Airisto Helme is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle news.
The information of the sources that appeared as anonymous was confirmed by the President of the Defence Committee Ilkka Kanerva (kok).
According to Kanerva, defence forces and defence police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily economic offence.
They were quite strict that they did not speculate that there was anything else here, Kanerva commented on the Yle interview.
According to the data above, the material confiscated has not yet been found to be linked to national security, but the investigation is only in its beginning.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed, one of the interviewers in Yle said.
A week ago, extensive home searches in the island and continent of Turku have raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere economic crime or a threat to internal security in Finland.
The evening magazine had a case in this week that deals with claims on both behalf and against.
Video: The dream paint saved the series that Liverpool lost
Liverpool’s 100 percent of Valioliiga’s start was completed, but it was still more pleased with the team at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday will be a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran to 1-0 guest wins.
Then the combination of Pep Guardiola sent a whole signal to Valioliga that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool's manager, Jûrgen Klopp, came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started Valioliiga with six successive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk seemed to rule alone on his own field.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great victory from Anfield Road on Wednesday.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the exchange seat to solve the match with a fantastic individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved immediately from the beginning.
In 25 minutes, he first balled in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
In the end, the chroat saw Hazard crashing forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard went a little on the edge of the punishment, but bombed the perfect left leg to the back of the bet.
Pool's bracelet Alisson was a little slow in his fight, and he didn't get his fingers on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the loss position fairly unfair because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah from the goal line.
In the second episode, Chelsea Veskari Kepa also got into real action.
Basque guard quickly responded to Sadio Manén's bet and pushed the ball from the dust into a corner shot.
On the other hand, Alisson zeroed his retreat to Hazard.
The best place for the guests arrived in 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino at his center.
However, the Brassistar pusku was directed towards David Luiz, a country teammate, who saved the hosts’ leadership position.
It didn’t last for 89 minutes when the exchanger Daniel Sturridge got free to shoot at 25 metres.
Sturridge played with his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it to the top of the unresistant bet.
Liverpool's 100 percent league was completed with 1-1 planes, but it's still in the league - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also strictly involved in the championship of two points behind the top.
In the clock transfer discussion, the poters are deep
I remember when a decade ago a magazine asked different Finnish influencers, which divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskisen's answer was the only one to remember: Nen's decision.
Some surnames have a nen-heading and some do not.
The Jakolinjoki can be born anywhere, and this was one of the bundles.
Finland has made it possible to give up the annual clock shift in the EU.
Very many agree that the shifting of watches twice a year has been the job of foolish people and has caused a wide range of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems at least to be the easiest step of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult now is to determine what time it ends: the current summer or winter age or any other time zone.
This also allows people to say their opinions on the.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open to Friday on 12 October.
The debate will take place in coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a word to say.
Winter time defends their position with the effect of the morning light on the well-being of people and the summer time, with the influence of the evening light on the desire of people’s outdoors and through the well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
According to research, morning light rhythms the human day and gives refreshment.
On the other hand, if you are not particularly suffering from awakening in the dark, the light increases the movement of people outside and gives better chances, for example, for autumn fences.
The number of additional lights after the normal working day has already been calculated for an hour.
I would prefer to take both, but badly, we can’t do anything in the northeast of the earth.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
The typical debate on the subject is that the view of your own is driven and the second is very strongly opposed.
The argument of the counterpart is not much heard because the most important thing is what it feels like.
Because almost everyone has an opinion about it, it’s somewhat worth trying to turn the other’s head.
It's going to be wasted.
The subject is very easy for the debate, because it does not require a great confusion and is sufficient to justify a mutu-consciousness.
In general, similar issues are more steeply and infertilely disputed.
If the wrong option becomes selected, it should be adapted to it.
And always it also offers a suitable shepherd if life feels bad.
Josba fought a foreign victory.
Josba’s first visitor game in Salibandy Divar produced full three serial points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki for a home trip with a joy of 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led a paint at the beginning of the third round, but Josba sought compositions and recycled men in the chains.
In time 50.47, the brothers Eetu and Juso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 winning painting.
In both teams, they played decisive minutes in balance.
Josba’s most effective was the Juso Journal (2+1).
The two chains were firepowered when the Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenk (1+0) also played its goal at the time of birth in the second chain.
Josba has six points after three series rounds.
O2-Jyväskylä will be with guests in two weeks.
On Sunday, the 200th anniversary of the Eno Church
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated on Sunday partly at a very sad atmosphere.
The incision of the Church was shocked a week ago.
The Church of Eno was guarded during the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still the place to celebrate.
Although no one would like that, the Church of Eno is now the oldest church of the Joensuu Church.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the municipalities and other associations of the world.
The family fair starts at Eno Church today at 10:00.
Then we go to the church house at the cattle table.
The program has all kinds of things inside and outside all day.
For example, the church building can be explored by the guide of Ari Räsäsen, a retired 37-year-old congregation master.
The church’s birth party also means the end of one era.
Already deleted, the church house built in 1982 keeps its doors open today for the last time.
Now we're at the ex-continental house, says Markku Koistinen.
The church house destroyed the internal air problems, but the church has been standing healthy for that 200 years.
Elon Musk is dismissed from the head of the Tesla Government's speech - the charges of fraud were settled for $40 million.
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have agreed on their case with the SEC of the U.S. Securities Market Authority.
SEC suspected Musk was committed to a securitisation, and Musk was in danger of being excluded from the company that was founded.
However, Musk can continue as CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk has to withdraw from the position of the Chairman of Tesla for three years.
The company has to hire a chairman of the external government.
Musk will also be subject to stricter control.
According to the agreement, Teslan must hire two independent leaders and continue to monitor the communication of Musk.
In addition, Tesla and Musk cost both $20 million (approximately €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market failures and the disadvantages caused by Tesla shareholders," says Steven Peiki SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company’s funding was secured.
Tviitti immediately raised Tesla’s share course.
SEC suspected Muski was committed to a securitisation.
According to the Agency, television was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken of an arrangement with other managers or potential donors of the company.
In practice, the Agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
On Friday, SEC announced to challenge the company and Muski.
SEC said he demanded Musk to be sentenced to fines and forbidden to operate in the management of stock exchange companies.
SEC's challenge was scary to investors, and Tesla's share went into a strong fall.
More than 800 people died in Indonesia’s rainfall and tsunami
In Indonesia’s earthquake and subsequent tsunami, the number of deaths has risen to at least 832, says the country’s disaster agency according to AFP.
The number of death victims is believed to continue to increase, as the number of damages is still being solved.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the final number may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised the tsunami that attacked the Please City on the island of Sulawes.
The tsunami was given immediately after the shock, however, a warning that was quickly canceled.
According to the authorities, almost all the dead known are at least for the time of the Receiver.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the area of Donggala, which is located at the center of the regeneration, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Rainy Assistance Requests
The Indonesian army has been alerted to rescuers to seek victims.
President Joko Widodon, arrived in the devastation area today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue work without exhausting for days and nights.
One of the centers of salvation is a hotel located in Palo, which is still believed to be 50-60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, Head of the Office for Rescue Works, said that the ruins of Roa-Roa Hotel, popularly loved by business travelers, could be dug one person alive at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
According to Syaug, the raining and tsunami area would quickly be needed for heavy cleaning equipment.
Many indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find those who are missing.
Help me, you at Palo and near.
My friend’s family members are still missing, one writer in the Facebook group.
Political phone numbers were leaked in the hands of disrupters in the UK
Many British politicians became annoyed when their contact information was leaked because of the shortcomings in the encryption of the application.
The disrupters were accessed, among other things, to ministers’ phone numbers.
This was the application used at the British Conservative Party Conference in the Government.
For example, Brexit was driven by Minister Michael Gove for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson.
A number of representatives received disruption calls.
As a result of the lack of encryption of the application, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians in the mobile application of the Conservative Party.
The public was able to access profiles using a politician's email address that was easily accessible online.
The user logged in the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to switch Boris Johnson to a profile picture of porn and title offensive for a moment.
Michael Goven's profile picture was replaced by a media mogule by Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to sign up to other people's profiles with these email addresses.
Then you can view the contact details of the profile person and, for example, send messages in this name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant’s phone number public, Foster criticized.
The Conservative Party spokesperson apologized for the information leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application now works safely.
The UK Information Authority ICO supports the data leakage.
The application was created by an Australian Crown Comms company.
The opponent’s working party criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland has a large number of pupils every week.
Watched viewers paid attention to the studio general reaction of the The Wall Finland vision program.
The United States of America’s rapidly spread in the world, The Wall ran as a Finnish version of Nelos last Saturday.
Heikki Paasose's host game show is described in Poland in the same studio where other international productions are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibility of description was exceptional, as the format of a large 12 metres high in the game walls required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, the social media highlighted the studio audience of the program, which was considered Polish.
On Twitter, we have a discussion about whether the Polishs may be sitting in the studio about a game to play in Finnish.
The Head of Four domestic programs, Unne Sormune, will illuminate it to the evening newspaper.
He tells us that there are close players in the studio audience, other Finnishs, foreign Finnishs living in Poland as well as just Polish viewers.
The public is composed of international tapers in Finland’s production, just like the audiences of the The Wall periods described in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professionals, who take part in the descriptions of different programs, Rormune backgrounds.
He reminds me that following the game itself is not so difficult, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish from each other.
However, there are interpreters in the studio for foreign languages that do the translation work.
There are two interpreters that interpret as a simultan translating to the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the public and tells us what kind of slope there is being thrown out, for example, and what is going on, says Sormune.
He compares the situation with David Hasselhoff recently in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a member of our Talent in Finland a few years ago.
He always got a simulation in the ear, and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish, the sum of Sormune.
The taiphan frost of the south of Japan moves towards the main island - the authorities warn of land belts and floods
The authorities also warn against possible land belts and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifuuni Tram, but according to the authorities, there are no major injuries and there are no data on the death victims so far.
In the southern Okinawa island the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK broadcaster, people have been evacuated to protectors and electricity has been broken from over 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been canceled, and the bullet trains are stationed for the storm.
The storm is expected to strike close to Osaka for half a day in Finland.
The capital city of Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there are also strong winds and rains.
Train shifts have been canceled today in Tokyo.
According to scientists, Trami tortures Japan until Monday.
The sky of the chess was darker
The beginning of the ace has been bad.
The sky darkened almost as long as the team lost on Saturday at home to Vaasa Sport, read 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Poris now have five consecutive losses, and there are two points in total at six rounds.
No chess defender or two lower chain players have yet to paint.
The pressures are also growing all the time.
Against sports, the audience had a lot of money at the time when the game was almost half left.
Six games are only played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, we have to take care of it, because we played so weakly.
Particularly the second series was disgraceful, the chess had the power of 1+2 by Jarno Kärki.
Of course, sports gains tasted.
The team had a game under Friday, so he would have thought it would have been seen.
Maybe it appeared, but the Aces didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, wonders about the number of audiences in the big hall.
In some way, he thought that this year there might not be so many people, Lordine will think about it in the morning.
In autumn 2017, at the same time with the bread day, the SM competitions of the Tractor Syndrome were held, so perhaps the expected number of publics could even drop a little from the previous year.
However, it happened differently; the corridors were already steadily blocked before ten, the sellers said the products were finished, the news was sold more than 500 doses before, and in the number of cars, Goodrinen heard the rise.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 660, Mr. Goodinen will later tell you this afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon for five hours, there was a lot of programs for children’s families, which, I think, attracted them to a recording lot.
In addition, Gentlemen estimates that the event will reach even further.
Sales also go to Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year, almost 100 dealers of conception, baking and harvesting products had arrived at the breadkeeper.
The mother of the bread day Pirkko Hyvärinen adored the number of audiences in the hall view.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, Teija Kivinieme's beautiful bread won a public vote.
There were 11 different forms of bread for children.
Marjatta Vepsälainen, the winner of the ruisle sandwich, spent the day in the pie of marts.
7 x the most beautiful light - here you recognize a good lamp
Wake up the space to life, create the right atmosphere for decoration and read the book without fatiguing your eyes.
Good lighting is worth a chance.
We gathered three good reasons for enlightenment.
Tips gave Innolux sales and marketing director Tarja Jokinemi.
Do a favor to your eyes
The importance of lighting is growing, the more ages are behind.
A sufficient light can help in problems that many people get through age when the accuracy of vision is reduced and more and more is suffering from obscurity.
For parents, the need for light is also growing.
A 60-year-old needs light three times more than twenty.
Therefore, for health reasons, it is worth taking place on the effects of light and the characteristics of the lighter.
A good lighter gives you enough light, but not shining, Jokinem’s tip.
Create beauty around you
Beautiful interior can only be found with the right lighting solutions.
At this moment, the decorator will be able to choose.
Popularly there is an unprecedented, Scandinavian and Japanese style.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retrotyl with strong colors, metal with different shades or ice cream colors has also become bums.
Aitous is fascinating in the same way as in the house's other decorations.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more bets are now than before, and the decoration has become a way to express itself.
Instead of mass production in your own home, a customized, brave lighter with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
We are very well-conscious, says Jokinemi.
Not necessarily the latest trendive lights are purchased at home, but the timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain untimely, jewelry and elegant classics keep their surfaces from year to year, says Jokinemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
Kookoo showed the door to the Canadian fan after three games
Kooko and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell are separated.
The Canadian winner played a total of three League games without power points, KooKoo will tell you when he says.
In August, O'Donnell moved to KooKooho with a one-year agreement, which included a lasting trial period at the end of September.

The player wants to show you an example of recycling - the goods go to the world in the recycle boxes, the plastic switched to paper
The game special business Player is now recycled in addition to the games as well as packaging materials.
Products of stone foot trade customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but made from recycled material.
For example, the products ordered from the online store are packed in packages from importers.
All the packages that come to us will be used for renovation.
We may use boxes for a decade of times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used, Ville Puurula Oulu’s Player tells us.
As a softening material, the company uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials.
Couple plastics are avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we should also move to recycling material in the envelopes.
The business wants to set an example for others as well.
Recycling is not a cause of extra trouble according to Puurula.
There is no big problem starting to recycle.
It will also result in financial savings when, for example, cardboard packs are reused.
Recycling is suitable for the game man’s activities, as, along with the new products, the main range of products of the movement includes, inter alia, the games and equipment used.
Each fashion-conscious purchase: One and the same shirt works in every costume
Classic clothes work in a season of a different costume than in a costume.
They create the basis of a good garderob in multipurpose, as it is easy to gather different residents around high-quality classics in favour.
In the autumn, the most used classics of the wardrobe are high-quality knives.
This category also includes a black pool.
The black knit made of natural material for semi-knitting can not have a failure to purchase.
The clothing can be combined with direct pants, bored meat and jeans, and it can be created around both a restrained housing and a brutal style.
Pooloneule is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classical stylish artist.
This is how you create a style.
The autumn trendilook comes from gold browns and wide-length spoons, black pooloneule and grey nipples.
The classic pooloneule together with other classics, blue green scotch box and wine-red loafers, constitutes a feminine and refined set of habitats.
Bring it to the black pooloneule by combining it with the trendy pieces of clothing: a jeaning skirt, high boots and thick socks.
Young and stylish!
The Sabotage operation of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the foreign intelligence of the Russian Federation SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this practice.
During the Soviet period, the so-called DRG groups specialised in the sabotage activities.
The name comes from Russian words diversionno-razvedja group: the sabotage and intelligence group.
The representatives of the KGB in the Western countries of the Soviet Security Service prepared detailed plans for the important sabotage destinations, says the archive manager Vasili Mitroh, who swept the west of the KGB (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and the early 2000s
The targets were ports, docks, large dams, oil processing plants and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired for DRG groups Bundeswehr, railways, hunters and certain persons uniforms and apartments for cover operations.
This trick was used by Russian parachute soldiers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed for local Ukrainian police riot equipment, founded inspection positions for you leading to Ukraine and separated from the country of Crimea.
Cold War Time Agents hid the sabotage groups in the terrain with mines, explosives, ignitioners and media.
In 1998, the KGB’s secret was found in Switzerland, which was exploded by the assaminoite when it was injected by the authorities.

HPK keeps Riska in its line for the end of the season, the press test time ended
Mika Toivola, a sports director of the Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (central) has been important to the team in the starts, subpower gaming and the defending role of the four-field.
Filip Riska, who played the first autumn during the experiment, will continue the end of the HPK in Hämeenlinna.
Experienced Riska, 33, success in the roles offered to him, assured the courier leadership.

Riska, a central player from Pietar Islands, has played a league in JYP, Lock and Sport.
Instead, Oskari Lehtinen left without a contract after the trial period.
Today on TV: The climber was left to die twice.
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man’s own experiences.
The evening film was made based on them.
Everest will now receive its first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, the destructive snow storm surprised the climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri’s 2015 guidance tells us about the survival struggle that has been processed from cereals.
Tragedy has been made of films and documents before.
The facts are also discussed in this case.
The world’s highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were excursions experienced by Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Just Hall was the Weathers guide.
Weathers' life could be saved before leaving Nepal.
As a result of this pressure and air pressure, he lost his vision, so the capturing of the top had to be missed.
Rob Hall went on a trip and no longer returned.
Weathers’ struggle for life and death had only begun.
When the storm got up, he was lost and no longer found back to the camp.
When a man came to find him, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not trusted in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
But as a miracle store, he got on his feet and found others.
The poorly cold weathers were thought to continue to die, and once again he was left to his own fortune.
Obviously, against other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the cylinders also began to believe in the possibility of giving him help.
In the movie, Beck Weathers plays Josh Brol.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
The 200-year-old Eno Church is celebrated today
The 200-year-old Church of Enon is celebrated today in the church.
The church was introduced on October 4, 1818, and for the celebration of the year, the entire family was prepared for Sunday.
The celebration began at Eno’s church at 10:00 a.m. at a family fair, after which there has been an antique of the cattle’s holding table at Eno’s church house.
The church was full.
The family was attended by 517 people.
The Lord of Eno Armi Rautavuori was glad that people had come to church so much.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work, Rautavuori (in the picture) says.
The fire of the incision threat Church has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno Church.
The Church of Eno is now the oldest Church of the Evangelical Lutheran Churches of Joensuu after the destruction of the Church of Excitement.
The acceleration risk was completed in 1770.
In the morning, an acceleration threat took place in a harassment in which the church destroyed in the fire was slowed down and remembered.
Pictures and videos: Mechanics flashed their magnificent power in Greece - Sea disappeared and the street became a river
A powerful hurricane-type storm raided from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane or medican is named Zorba.
The Greek Air Science Institute has given red weather warning to the regions of Attika, Peloponnesos, the islands of Joonia, the Cyclates and Crete.
There are plenty of floods from the area around Greece.
The video published on Twitter shows how the river has suddenly appeared in the town of Kiato in the area of Korinthia instead of the street due to floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwater.
In the southern part of Peloponnesos, a hard wind caused a strong sea trip.
The Embassy of Athens instructs people on their Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The Delegation calls for the monitoring of weather information and the instructions of local authorities.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings with them hard roads and even flood danger.
According to CNN, a 2011 published study, only once or two years of media occurs throughout the world, typically on the roads of September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
Now the blowing storm left floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing to go north and Europe.
In Greece, the refugee camps have also caused concern in the islands, such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
During the summer, the areas destroyed by landscapes are also underground storm in the Athens environment.
In Greece, the medican also roared last November.
There is no need to go to the sea, yet flights in their schedule - the Greek islands threatened by the storm of the storm are currently holidaying thousands of Finns
The trips to the sea will be canceled and walked should be careful not to fly on the storm.
Such guidelines have been shared by guides for a fair trip to Finland through the sun travels in Greece on the weekend.
Instructions will be needed, as even the storm of Zorbas, which has been predicted to be going to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the nearest of the island of Crete, wind speed can rise up to 45 meters per second.
The weather increases the rainfall.
All travelers from Greece travelling through Solar and Tuin who have announced their phone number have been alerted to a tough wind with text messages.
Still the sun and the heat in the air
According to Inka Ikosen, a solar travel specialist at the beginning of Saturday nights, the worst of the holidays have been avoided.
For example, flights have landed and rising according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we follow the situation all the time.
Security ahead.
I supported media supervisor Antonia Schroderus says their flights have also been on schedule.
We are constantly connected to our staff.
At least Kreet was still calm, he told me about the beginning of Saturday.
The most popular Greek islands – Rodos and Crete – currently have a total of 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are staying in smaller places.
For example, the worst storm in the island of Kos will arrive on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodo had spooked the sun and the temperature painded to 27 degrees, the Ikonen of Sunshine says.
Zorbas has been estimated to become the next Turk, although slightly lessened.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and have checked, for example, the number of Finns flying with Antalya, says Schroderus.

Two robot cars start to operate in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers, the city of Espoo will inform you.
Takenieme’s robot cars work in the role of a bus simulator, as the next spring in the area is to start traffic with a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots all year round robot vehicle traffic and tests the technical performance of vehicles in Finland.
The experiment shows how robot cars can handle the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in the real environment, says traffic management manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robot cars will automatically pass with other transport without special transport arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is always responsible for the auxiliary passenger on board.
Vehicles all the time feel their environment on a variety of sensors and evaluate whether the road is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether a vehicle, bicycle or, for example, snow shield has been detected, says the Sensible 4 CEO Harri Santamala.
Robotic cars travel throughout the autumn on three days a week: Tuesdays from 13 to 15 pm, Wednesday at 10-15 pm and Thursday at 10-15 pm.
Robot cars stop by six stops along the route and take passengers.
Robot car stops identify the stop markings.
I'm sure you can get in from the station on the takeaker number 1.

Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Metsähallitus and the Finnish Hunting Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department’s team members told the social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the surveillance was in the lawfulness and authorisation of the hunting.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting card and a hunting permit required in state countries.
In addition, hunting weapons were subject to checks and the allowable number of ammunition weapons used in the canal breeding process.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection, and in the context of the inspection, only one hunter who lacked the required hunting permit was met.
The hunter was assigned to unauthorized fishing for 12 days' tickets.
In addition, the police flew 133 drivers, and two of them are suspected of riding a car.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in the fine procedure, the police once.
As a summary, hunters are very well in compliance with the hunting authorisation.
Many hunters were surprised by monitoring.
One hunter said, "I've been hunting for 50 years in the area, and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting surveillance in autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
The silence goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of Interior Kai Mykkänen (kok.) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to follow the choice of quota refugees to Finland.
Finland has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Choices are usually made a couple of times a year and are accompanied by representatives from the Immigration Agency, the Ministry of Labour and Industry and the Police.
The delegation is already interviewing in Turkey.
The UNHCR first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly urgent position in refugee camps, such as single parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the future group in Finland than there is in the quota, because some of them are practically uncommitted for different reasons.
In a quiet way, there are also NGOs working on the borders of Turkish Minister of Interior, Syleyman Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi is also the Head of Office of the Ministry of the Interior.
Quota lifting
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a few years, the quota was 1 050 per year, but there has been no agreement in the government to lift it.
The meeting has supported the increase in the quota, but the project has last fallen into the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk.) recently presented a gradual increase in quota to 1 500-2,000 people per year.
A delay in visit is the first time in this government period, which the Minister of the Interior will take place to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Former Ministers of Interior Petteri Orpo (kok.) and Paula Risikko (kok.) were able to move to their new tasks before their visits were organized.
Finland receives EUR 10,000 from the EU for all particularly vulnerable refugees.
Now we're going to the hacks - I don't know if it's crying or laughing
Last Saturday, the Karjalainen reported a legislative proposal to amend the animal protection law.
The article understood that the legislative proposal in principle prohibits the holding of animals in production animals, pets or otherwise in business in relation to all animals which are not separately authorised by the ministries’ regulations.
Therefore, all other animals are originally prohibited except separately mentioned in the Regulation.
If the legislative proposal ends the law, it means that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law separately prohibits action that endangers the security of society or the good way.
We are now setting out in principle the prohibition of any action to which the law or regulation does not give a separate authorisation.
The change leads to the fact that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and that nothing else will be done until the law or regulation it adopts.
Government activities in the preparation of law have generally been weak.
If we are going to the path now that, in Finland, everything is prohibited, which is not permitted separately, no longer know if it is crying or laughing.
I don't doubt that the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
However, this is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I don’t know the Constitution very well, but I think it accepts such a "any thing that is not permitted by law or regulation" procedure.
I hope there is a reasonable minister who will suspend the progress of such a legal project.

Kimi Räikkönen casted the cause of Mercedes' superiority compared to Ferrar
Ferrarin Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard in Russian gp times.
However, there is no reason to fall in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver evaluates.
They were just faster than us, but it's not a big deal.
Our car was the best of time for the weekend for now, but they were just too fast, fourth, and his co-worker Sebastian Vetteli and the Mercedes speed was clearly left by Räikkönen.
Ferrar had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
They asked the man why the sudden fall in Mercedes' ride is the reason for it.
They seem to go faster than us - so simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go the same speed as them.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, there was a rare taste for the coming talli Sauber of the Räikkö.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Ferrar in the next season, was the seventh, and the last time session also elevated Marcus Ericsson.
The 10th place of departure for the Swedish driver is best for more than three years.
And even though in the second driving session, five drivers did not drive completely, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for the Räikes to think about the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the early season, a step forward has been big.
Next year, there's a different story, so let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius smashed Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erka Teper's match at Stuttgart's evening went on in uniform signs.
The German was a more innovative party in the circle, but he did not get a good hit.
Obviously, Helenius controls the match with his hard series that found well there.
The Finn was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
Finally, the solution came in the eighth round when Helenius smashed the left straight to Teper.
The hit was so hard that the coward who fought before the public at home did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory, Helenius ventilated quite moderately.
During the screening, he initially praised the good atmosphere and opponent created by the public.
Then he changed his language for a moment.
Thank all viewers and Finnish encouragers.
We took the belt today.
Helenius was happy right after the match.
It was a great victory for Helenius' career.
Perhaps it would be a chance to even get to the MM match, Helenius commented on the evening magazine before the match.
The death might have ended the whole boxing career.
Of course it's been in mind.
This is no longer the younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper attack.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster can be multiplied
According to the Guardian magazine, the vice-president of the country calls for a clear increase in the number of victims.

So far, all the victims are from Palo, and the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been hurt badly.
There are still people in sorted buildings that the saviors have not been able to get out.
For example, Roa Roa Hotel on Palo has fallen.
The rescuers say they heard the screams of those who were trapped from ruins, but the lack of cleaning equipment has delayed the beginning of salvation.
Indoneesia President Joko Widodo has ordered the army for rescue and rainfalls.
There is a need for the military and its equipment, as electricity and communications links in the catastrophic area are crossed in many places.
Fuel reserves are also getting exhausted.

The last book I've read... Anttikoski said thinking.
In the audience, a break of thought took place until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've read...

Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts of popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
The researchers of Sydney University analysed the matter have described two types of "coolity" consisting of a little different features: generally attractive coolness and contradictory contradictory colosiveness.
According to the description of researchers, the cool people had many socially desired features: they were outward-oriented, friendly, friendly and qualified.
In contrast, there was a typical distance, independence, rebelliousness and disruption.
They thirsted experience and cared only about external assessments.
Both types combined good self-esteem and stable emotional life.
The role of hardcore is no longer cool: high status in teen age does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the US research published in the Child Development magazine in 2014.
Young people who were dating early, celebrating, looking for good-looking people and trying to favor others had an increased risk of using drugs as young adults and taking offences.
In their relationships, they managed weaker than they had ever done with more unconscious companions.
The high-state locks, bags or watches don't make people cool - or, at least, truly attracting company.
In the study published in August in Social Psychological and Personality Science, most of the people were more prepared to make friends with their ordinary market suits than with their dressing shirts, despite the fact that most of them chose a brand in the context of their visit.
If you're on the Greek holiday island, watch out!
There is a storm attacking - weather warning shouts red
During the weekend in southern Greece, water can rain as much as in Finland during the average period of six months.
The Zorbas horror storm strikes Greece during the weekend.
Prepare yourself to stay in the area of Peloponnesos, the islands of Joonia, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Athenian Embassy will report it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Air Science Service has given the regions a red weather warning.
The approaching storm is also reported in Foreca's blog.
According to it, the hardest hips of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
Due to comparison, the Kuisma storm whipped Finland from the beginning of the week, with its hardest blowing fairs in 31 metres per second.
According to the blog, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the heavy rain.
The weekend in South Greece can come more than 300 millimetres of water.
It is responsible for about half of the annual amount of rain in Finland.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared the video of the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods to Tunisia and Libya this week.
Do you recognize the death of the men in Love Island in Finland?
Youtube videos are confusing
It is rare to know that in the Love Island Finland series, the beautiful Anku of many men died is also seen as an adventure of Youtube videos published in 2010.
With videos, Anku advises askartists, among other things, to prepare a blueberry from the old paper roll.
Anchor also shows its sympathetic style how socks can shake a silk to which the right snacks grow.

Valter Bottas shake and pursued an adrenaline in Sotsh, will he become a helper of Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shake a little further decades after the Russian gp's fasting point when he was in front of the media.
The great round left Mercedes’ first-part of Lewis Hamilton and was sure to be an important critic for the Finnish driver gathered this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the solution.
It's good, I'm still shaking, Bottas.
I've only been on the stake once this year, in Austria (in the centre), so time has been quite a long time.
This track has been good to me before, and I have received good rounds again.
It is not easy to pass on the Sotshi track, so the departure is in a particularly big role.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer the curiosity, whether he's going to win tomorrow or whether he's in front of the MM title coming to Hamilton.
My point of departure is definitely trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave, Bottas.
But as a tall, we fight for both championships.
Lewis's lead to Sebastian Vetteli is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so keep in mind.
Let's see what happens, however, Bottas supplemented.
After driving, Hamilton was truly happy for the success of Bottax, and the Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolff also tasted.
Lewis had a plan to win the Valter, but he didn't succeed in the seventh.
He knows he has to tear everything up to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline had gone out of his ears, Wolff shined.
The question is whether the tall will allow Bottaksen and Hamilton to drive fairly, Wolff responded contradictoryly.
We'll talk about it tomorrow morning, and let's see how the race goes.
Kiteel Erno Kinnunen won the Rall of Finland Championship
The race SM series rarely ended.
The brothers have never ended up as champions of Finland at the same time.
Now it was done in the Turku and Salo’s decision-rall, Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Kiteel Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career when the third place of the final race sealed him from the SM4 category of two-wheel cars of Finland.
Kinnune, who competed with Honda Civic, and Ville Mäkelä, started the market's sub-competitive competition in Malta because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group guaranteed a SM title.
In the darkness of Friday evening, the twin had to give a leveling when some of the additional lights were betrayed by another special test.
It's going to be a little blind to the third one.
In such a situation, it's not appropriate to be fooled.
On Saturday, only a second-series Jussi Tepo followed, Kinnunen told me.
Syria demands the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their forces
The Syrian Foreign Minister demands that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops from Syria.
On Saturday, the UN General Assembly spoke to Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Muallem saying that foreign forces must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops are fighting terrorism in Syria, and he said the war against terrorists is almost over.
In his UN speech, Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their home country.
However, the seven years of war will not end.
Over 360,000 people have died in the war.
In Germany on Friday, co-founder Angela Merkel said that in October, there was a Syrian meeting that would include the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans looked at the Supreme Court's tribute on TV
The Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and professor Christine Blasey Ford who blamed him for harassment were given an exceptional number of people at the front of the boxes.
The appointment drama of the Supreme Court judge in the United States took at least 20 million people to their TVs on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, named by Donald Trump, and California Professor Blasey Ford, who blamed him for harassment, were presenting his story in front of the Senate Justice Committee.
According to the preliminary findings, six main channels, i.e. ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to their online consultation, several million more were followed.
NBC said that 6.8 million people followed the livestock and CNN reported that they had made a record of 8.2 million live shipments on the start of the year.
The CNN number will rise by more than 10 million when youTube and Facebook are counted as tracking the shipment.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million startups.
Digital startups are channels owned, TV-views come from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they are incredible anyway.
Hard to reach to 20 million
More than 20 million audiences in the United States are usually only available for sports matches and major Oscar and Grammy games in the entertainment world, as well as random political events such as presidential speeches and presidential protests in 2016.
The U.S. most viewed program, the NFL final match for the American football league, is certainly a trip to Super Bowl.
This year Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people on the NBC channel.
Last year, Trump’s first speech to the Congress, according to Nielsen, looked at about 48 million people and 30 million people in office.
The Important thing
The appointment of the Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the United States because the offices are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one of the new judges when Antonin Scali died from the beginning of 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the silloid President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was a so-called vaa'an language in a number of questions, which could be resolved by the 9-hour position of the court.
He was a supporter of abortion and sexual minority rights and, for example, decided in 2015 in a voice that the same sex had the right to marriage throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His choice to the Supreme Court may lock the right to conservative power for decades.
Children have the right to receive their information to parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see the health information of their children from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Initially, the situation of the Kanta service was even more worrying: parents did not even have access to health information or recipes for young people.
In the autumn 2016, a temporary correction was obtained for people under 10 years of age.
After that, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has been astonishing for a long time.
Now the correction is promised - in 2020.
Because the problem is clear, the change of the legal basis should not have been more than an auction.
After that, the understanding of the painter is about the pressing button: when the pile is captured, it will be opened.
Of course, the child can show his information to his parents if he has bank IDs or official ID cards.
But how many ten-year-olds have?
Personal cards are paid, and 10 years of age is not even available.
In practice, the fourth-class information of the sub-school will not be seen by anyone except by requesting it printed.
It is not as much as the right of parents as the right of children.
The child’s care is extremely important for parents to be involved in it.
Of course, the right to privacy of teenagers must be cared.
The minors may also have family situations where all things cannot be spoken freely.
They often relate to sexual health, which free care is deeply relevant to human rights.
In the United States, the FBI started attacking Kavanaugh's harassment charges.
According to the U.S. media, the FBI finds out at least two women's disruptions.
One of the women had been consulting the Senate Legal Committee this week.
Kavanaugh has denied the accusations of alleged sexual harassment during her studies.
President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The study should not last longer than a week.
According to Washington Post, this is a criminal investigation of an unlimited investigation, and it may not be public.

Assistance organisations prepare to start their work at Indonesian Sulawes - "The Clean water is the most urgent"
The UN Children's Organization for Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help in the island of Indonesian Sulawes, says Kirsi Haru, head of information from Finland's Unicef.
The local authorities lead rescues, but the need for additional assistance is already obvious at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency aid, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
Please, in Sulawes, rescue measures are underway, but the situation in Donggala area is slightly norther.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Support actions are difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
The buildings are often light-structured in Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquake and tsunami are large.
When the survivors have been found, they need protection, first of all, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
For the first time, people are mostly able to offer water cleaning tablets that Unicef has in stock.
Water systems are designed to be repaired as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported first by trucks, for example.
In crisis situations, many children get rid of their parents.
Looking for family members and connecting families is part of Unicef’s mission.
The World Food Programme (WFP) is organised as part of the United Nations.
In the initial phase of emergency assistance, the funds previously collected are used.
However, Unicef has already launched a money collection to help victims of Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami.
Millionaire Elon Musk, as Chairman of the Government of Tesla - $20 million fines for twitters
Elon Musk, founder of space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges by agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Millionaire Elon Musk stops his job as chairman of the Tesla Government and accepts fines of $20 million.
Musk is dismissed as part of the agreement with the U.S. securities market supervising authority.
By accepting Musk to avoid fraud.
The U.S. Securities Commission SEC threatened Musk for securities fraud due to the tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw the electric car company from the stock market, which led to a rapid increase in the company’s share course.
According to the agreement, Musk must not act as Chairman of the Government of Tesla for three years.
In addition, Teslan must appoint a new "independent member" of his government and take two "independent leaders".
Teslan must also establish a committee to monitor the communication of Musk.
Musk can continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Muski’s personal $20 million fines, the Tesla company also has to pay 20 million equivalent fines to the financial administrator.
Twitches misled investors
According to SEC, Musk twitches led investors and Tesla shareholders to mislead.
Musk argued that he would have guaranteed funding to rebuy Tesla from the stock exchange as a private shareholder.
According to the billionaire twitches, the company would have been purchased from the stock market to the stock price of $420.
Tesla’s share rate increased by more than 10 per cent per day after tweets, but later fell.
According to the SEC, Muski’s claims did not have any basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his claim for funding.
He had not discussed the withdrawal of the stock exchange with another management group or company government.
On Friday this week, the course fell by 14 per cent when SEC announced the fraud charges.
The news agreement is expected to strengthen the company’s course again.
The last judgment is not a reason
The clocks of the church are not naturally ringing when the wise ones don’t move.
It's a technical mistake.
The tower of the Helsinki Court of Justice has stopped.
The wise will show you at 12:00.
The situation is like a medieval horror movie: even when the crypt of the church would be famous for managing and the masters would call themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it has broken.
It has been seen by a repairer, but some parts have broken, and a new part is expected to be expected, souling Evelina Jamsen says.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned in the Twitter account in Helsinki.
The final judgment is not the reason for stopping the clock.
Jamsen says the church watches don't make a mistake.
