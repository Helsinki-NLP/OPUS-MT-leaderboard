Members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to find themselves at Muppet Show
Certain members of the National Assembly have been attacked on the proposal to change their address to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, representative of the Wales Parliament).
The alarm attacked after emerging, the name of the National Assembly (Assembly) should be the Wales Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
All of the representatives of different political backgrounds are now afraid that the new title can make them ridiculous.
According to one of the working parties, the group is concerned that their new name will riot the words "Twp" and "Pwp".
For the sake of our readers, twp in the walesi language is one thing, and pwp is a coke.
According to one of the representatives of the Plaid Party, the whole group is “unhappy” and therefore recommend alternatives.
One of the conservative representatives said his group was “open” to change the name, but noted, however, that the MWP was just a jump to “Muppet”.
Here it is worth noting that in the walesi language, the letter "w" is thrown similarly in the English of Yorkshire, i.e. by the MWP "map".
The opinion of the National Assembly Committee responsible for the development of the draft legislative draft for name change is: “The final decision on the titles for the name of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the representatives.”
The Act 2017 regulating Wales's government has allowed you to change the name of the Wales National Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation which proposed the inclusion of the name of the Wales Parliament and which received broad support.
As regards the address of the representatives, the Commission prefers the address of the Welsh Parliament Member (Member of the Wales Parliament) and the shortening of the WMP, but the public consultation has rather supported the alternative of the MWP.
Members will come up with new and new alternatives, but the agreement is quite difficult, which is a problem for President Elin Jones of the National Assembly, who will have to submit a legislative proposal on changes in names in the coming weeks.
The law on reforms will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including the discretion of representatives and the structures of the Commission.
Representatives will be able to make their final vocals on their own address when discussing the draft law.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the name of the country
Citizens vote on Sundays on whether the name of the country will be changed to the "Fear-Macedón Republic".
The aim of the referendum is to put a point at the end of a decade of debate with the neighbouring Greece, whose domain is also called Macedonia.
Athén has long been saying that he has essentially raised a territorial demand with his northern neighbour’s name and has repeatedly challenged its request for EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the referendum on name change and so does not take part in it.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in name, is simply a compromise that needs to be made for their EU-Nathoe accession.
Harlem churches in a difficult situation, St. Martin's bells are silent.
“As I hear from older people, there was a bar on every corner and a church,” Adams said.
“Not one of them today.”
As you say, the disappearance of the bars would be even understandable.
“People are already in a different way today,” he says.
Bars are no longer the social living room where people end every day.”
As for the churches, Adams is afraid that the sale of the Church’s wealth does not invade the hopes of the leaders, “and in time they will be back where they left.”
And to the place of the churches, it adds, there will be residential buildings that do not help the destiny of the remaining churches.
"The majority of those buying apartments will be white," he says, and this will continue to speed up the final closure of churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these apartments would join the Faith."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black city – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin in a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out of the church in the thirty years,
It was then owned by a nearby black congregation.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by the black church led by John Howard Johnson, the reverend of the Harlemi shopping car, the 125th street to use blacks or the black products to be marketed unwillingly run against its business owners.
In 1939, a fire was caused by serious damage in the building, but during the renovation, the bell game was built to order the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson, and his successor in St. Martin’s Plébánia, proudly referred to the bells of the poor.
In July, a bell game expert said this bell game was “a cultural heritage”, “a irreplaceable, historically important instrument”.
The Michigani University expert, Tiffany Ng, also noted that this was the first bell game in the world, which was spoken by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who broke into the bigger bell game of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin has not signed anyone to his place.
In the past few months, St. Martin had a complex situation with the involvement of buildings and entrepreneurs, partly in the worldly leadership of the temple, partly in the Bishop’s office.
In July, the head board of Parókia, the Church Council, turned in writing to the Bishop’s Office, objecting to the fact that the Office would ‘transfer the costs’ to the Council, where the Council did not participate in the selection of buildings and entrepreneurs by the Office.
Certain members of the Faith are complaining of lack of transparency in the House of the Office.
Cápa attacked a 13-year-old California boy during cancer fishing
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy during cancer fishing on the opening day of the cancer season on Saturday in California.
The attack took place at the Beacon's Beach coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel, on the KSWB channel in San Diego, said that he and his friends sued about half an hour ago when he was aware that he cried for help. Then he plunged with a majority of his own to help him out of the water.
Hammel first thought the boy was just excited because he managed to catch cancer, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, “He bite!
He bit me!"
“The key bone was torn,” Hammel said, what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I started screaming to get everyone out of the water: “There is shark in the water.”
The boy was transported with an air rescuer to the Rady Child Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently treated in critical condition.
The type of shark attacking the boy is not known.
As Captain Larry Giles said to the press, a few weeks earlier, the shark was detected in the area, but then it was established that it was not one of the species that were dangerous to humans.
Captain Giles also said that the boy suffered traumatic injuries on his upper body.
The authorities closed the coastal break between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the time of the investigation and for security reasons.
According to Giles, more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
The Sainsbury's would expand on the British Beauty Market
The Sainsbury's expert would take the competition with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
The loss of the sale of fashion and household articles is also amongst the constantly strengthening of £2.8 billion in the British beauty care market, and, if successful, they will appear in more than 11 stores across the country.
Strengthening the pipeline is due to the attempt of shops in different ways to upload the shelf surfaces previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household articles.
Sainsbury's said that it doubles its offer to 3000 products, including representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are now the first to offer.
But previous brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be located in a larger area in brand-based stations like Boots and similar stores.
The chain also reinitiates the Boutique makeup family, where most of the products are now vegan – they are now looking for more and more young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop also tested its appearance in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which has been opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second year it opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
By extending online purchases and redirecting food shopping practices to small local trades, large-scale purchases must make more effort to disappoint customers.
According to the Director-General of Sainsbury, Mike Coupe, the offer will be more and more similar to mixed trades, as the trade chain is trying to introduce more and more services and other products other than foods to compete with discontent stores like Aldi and Lidl.
Since the two chains were purchased two years ago, Sainsbury's hundreds of stores opened Argos classes and some Habitat classes – this step has also had a positive impact on food sales, so the award is even more profitable.
The chain has failed the previous attempt to cure beauty and medicine classes.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's got into a joint venture with Boots, but the debate on the distribution of the revenues of the pharmaceutical classes in its stores ended this.
The new strategy was created after three years ago, the Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmaceutical store for 125 million pounds of pharmaceuticals to Celesió, the Lloyds Patic Chain.
According to the store chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider palette of luxury skin care products with brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As Paul Mills-Hicks said, “We want to create a better environment by transforming our piperestors’ appearance.
We also picked up qualified staff, who will help interested people with advice.
Our brand offer all the demands, and the attractive environment and the conveniently accessible site provide an enthusiastic power that increases your purchase experience to a new level.”
Peter Jones "shocked" after Holly Willoughby abandoned the 11 million-dollar agreement
The star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones, left "tombred" after Holly Willoughby's TV director has ceased to enter into 11 million important agreements on the business of lifestyle products to focus on the new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the Truly brand selling home clothes and accessories.
The two celebrity companies were compared to the Goop brand previously recorded by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old show manager of this Morning announced on Instagram that he would leave.
Holly Willoughby thoroughly pulled out the gymnastics at the Dragons' Den Star, Peter Jones, when he left their promising, lifestyle products marketing company at the last moment – to focus on his own, extremely profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to certain sources, Jones was “cooling” when the TV’s saviour was released on Tuesday at the Marlow of Jones’s business empire (Buckinghamshire) in a tense discussion that no longer had enough time for the new contracts of a total of 1,5 million pounds, which could be devoted to their common brand, which distributes home wear and accessories, Truly.
The two celebrity companies were compared to the Goop brand previously recorded by Gwyneth Paltrow and expected to double Willoughby’s estimated assets for 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced to leave Truly on Instagram, Jones went from the island to one of his vacationers.
One source says: “The Truly was the most important thing for Holly.
He was going to deal with this for a long time, and this will give you the opportunity to live in the next few decades.
It was a surprise for everyone.
Everyone was surprised, what happened on Tuesday, since the start was so close.
In the Marlow office, the warehouse is full of the goods to sell."
According to experts, the departure of one of the most profitable stars of this Morning’s show managers in Britain can be made by millions of businesses from pillows and candles to clothing and home wear, thanks to possible slippings.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-child show manager and his husband, Dan Baldwin, served close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, ten years ago.
He started Truly with Willoughby Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples are used to holiday together and Jones has 40 percent share in Baldwin's production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S brand and take over Ant McPartlin as the director of the ITV I'm The Celebrity show.
Last night, a source close to Jones commented on what happened: “We don’t want to report on the business of [Jones].”
They said, “We fell in love.”
He was joking about the criticisms that the press would receive for the statement that some might say “unprecedented” and why he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump let you so much?
He asked Trump in a funny "renowned readers" voice.
“I didn’t let any of them.”
As he noted, Kim would like to meet for the second time after Trump welcomed the first negotiations in Singapore as a huge step towards North Korea's nuclear weapons.
However, the discussions on nuclear weapons have begun.
More than three months after the June Singapore Summit, Ri Jongho, who represented North Korea, announced to the UN General Assembly that, as his country sees, the United States did not have a “appropriate answer” to the early armed action of North Korea.
Instead, according to its statement, the United States continues to maintain sanctions for pressure exercise.
Trump said it more optimistic in a campaign talk.
“Everything in North Korea is going very well,” he said.
We were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have lost.
Now the relationship between us is very good.”
As he said, his efforts to improve relationship with Kim have shown positive results – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he was talking so unusual about his relationship with Kim.
“Now it’s not difficult to behave, but now there’s no ten thousand people trying to get in, just two hundred of them are in front of me,” Trump said.
In Indonesia, there are hundreds of dead in the tsunami and earthquake of the island
Indonesia also rejected the assistance of international aid organisations after the Lombo earthquake.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombs had to be installed, there was no national disaster, which would be a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, they have said very clearly that they do not require international assistance, so our situation is a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on the collection of a Paluba-accessable aid team, but it is not yet sure that foreigners will be able to participate in the local savings.
Sutopo, the spokesman of the National Disaster Protection Agency, says that Indonesian agencies are currently assessing the request situation to see whether it is necessary to involve international aid organisations.
Despite the continuation of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to face the devastating power of nature.
Although tsunami areas were built in Aceh Province, in other coastal areas it is not common at all.
At the same time there was a tsunami signal, the apparent lack of the tsunami marker siren system in Palu also contributed to the development of a catastrophe that demands human life.
In the Indonesian islands, even at the best time, transportation can be difficult.
During natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationing in Lombs is on the way to Palu, but at least three days before it reaches the affected zone.
Joko Widodo put the development of its collar infrastructure in Indonesia at the heart of his election campaign and did not save costs in road and rail projects.
However, before the next year's elections, the Law Government is now facing fiscal deficits.
In addition, the President must face the continually present tensions in Indonesia, as the majority of Muslims began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1000 people had to die and tens of thousands of people had to be put in place because of disruptions, during which Christian and Muslim bands fell to each other on the streets with bosom cutters, bowls, and arrows, and other armors.
Video: Daniel Sturridge of the liver side is a huge equation against Chelsea
In the London Stamford Bridge, Daniel Sturridge played the Premier League game with his 89-minute goal to save Liverpool, who did not lose Chelsea.
The team was losing 0-1 when Sturridge was given from Chelsea gate to about 30 meters from Xherdan Shaqiri.
He first put the ball on the left and then kicked a huge kick in the remote corner of the gate.
The shooting was highly over the sixteenth, and it was headed towards the upper corner of the net.
The ball ended up in the bedroom over Kepa Arrizabaga.
“I just wanted to get in position, because there is always someone like Shaq who plays the ball, so I tried to get myself in the better position,” Sturridge said, answering the LiverpoolFC.com question.
“I saw Kante coming and I took it off, then I didn’t think much, and I shot it.”
Chelsea led to 1 to 0 in the mid-term after the 25th minute of the Belgian star player Eden Hazard took the lead.
In the battle of blues, Mateo Kovačič passed the ball with the corners of the corners and then managed to break it down on the middle track and run into Liverpool Square.
Kovačič started and got the ball back on the middle course.
Then he started Hazard with a beautiful transfer to the sixteen.
Hazard ran away from protection and eventually sent the ball to the remote corner of Liverpool at the gate of Alisson Becker.
Liverpool meets Napoli as the next station of the Champions League group matches on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. in the Arena of Napoli Stadio San Paolo.
Chelsea plays against Videoton on Thursday afternoon at 3:00 in London in the UEFA Europe League.
There are 832 victims of Indonesian tsunami
The number of victims of Indonesian earthquake and tsunami increased by 832, announced by the local disaster protection agency on Sunday.
As a result of the 7.5 strong earthquake on Friday and 6 metres of high escape waves, more people were buried by the ruins, reported by the spokesman of the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The streets of more than 380 thousand souls in Palu are covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man in the case of a woman stabbed.
The police started investigating in a murder case after they found a woman's body in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews at 7:55 a.m. on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was already arrested with suspected murder.
The police are asking the residents in the neighborhood to report to anyone who saw anything or died.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is still in an early stage, however, I would like everyone who was in Birkenhead near John Street and perhaps saw or heard something to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxis drivers, to find anything that may have been recorded with the on-board camera, because they may have important information for the investigation.”
The police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a birkenhead resident and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, the women’s friends arrived at the site to find out where the body was found in the morning hours.
The investigation is underway and the police will inform the victim's relatives for the time being.
One taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter the building and no one could leave it.
When he found out what happened, he couldn't talk.
The residents of the building have now been informed that it may take more hours to get back to the building.
One of the police told someone that the building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was struggling with her tears.
“This is terrible,” he repeated.
At 2:00 a.m., two police buses stayed inside the line, and one other outside.
There were several police officers watching the block.
Anyone who has any information, write a message to @MerPolCC address, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers with no name to call 0800 555 111 and refer to the 247 file of 30 September.
The statue of the Parliament Cromwell is the latest victim of the rewriting fever of history
The expulsion of the statue might be a poetry justice, for Cromwell and his followers of fanatic puritan destroyed the cultural and church heritage of England with the inspiration of the Taliban.
The Cromwell Society said, however, that Crick’s proposal for “smartness” is “a attempt to rewrite history.”
The Cromwell Society president, John Goldsmith, said: “It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell Zobor before the Westminster Palace would eventually become a targetboard in the current discussions on the removal of the statue.
During the British Civil War, Cromwell did not order and execute the imagination.
So maybe another Cromwell could be a victim of his predecessor, Thomas's actions.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fascinating Cromwell's opinion reflects the opinion of the 19th century and sets a memory of historic shapes that many people have to celebrate even today."
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is probably less than at the end of the 19th century, but many of them still regard Parliament as a protector against external pressure, which was of course an external pressure in his case of monarchy.
The fact that this picture is truly accurate remains a subject of a history debate.
However, so many people are sure that this conflict in the middle of the XVII century had an impact on the development of another fate of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
And it is worth celebrating and remembering your results as a Lordprotect."
Killed pig wounded to death a Chinese farmer
According to the local press, a pig attacked and wounded a farmer on a market in the southwest of China.
The man identified as Yuan only was found with blood-coated beats on the market of the town of Liupanshui in the region of Kujcsou, reported the case on Sunday of South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer is preparing to infest pigs in a breed on 30 May 2005 in Xining City, China Csinghaj Province.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, he found his cousin on the man's body and discovered that his neighbouring pig's door was open.
He said the mouth of the vast Scandinavian in the pig was bloody.
According to the report, the expert study found that the farmer was actually killed by 250 pounds of pigs.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and were marcanged,” said Guiyang Evening News only in his ceremonial name, Wu.
According to the security cameras, Yuan entered the pig at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday, to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig was closed so that the police would no longer harm others while investigating traces on the site.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are currently discussing compensation for the death of the man.
Although it doesn’t happen often, it has already been reported before when pigs attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their massachusettsi farm and caused life-threatening injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales squeezed a farmer to the tractor until the man’s wife failed to alarm him.
After an oreganian farmer was falsified in 2012 by his own pigs, a manitoba farmer said in the CBC News that pigs are usually not inclined to attack, but the blood taste can become aggressive.
“They are very players.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them respect," he said.
Rainfalls after Rosa Hurricane in the Southwest of the United States
The hurricane Rosa is increasingly weakening according to predictions as the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico are above.
However, Rosa will continue to cause serious rainfalls in the south-western parts of Mexico and the United States.
Rosa hit a hurricane with a speed of 140 km/h, a category 1 hurricane on the east coast by Sunday at 620 km southwestern from Punta Eugenia in Mexico at 5:00 a.m.
The hurricane is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low air pressure zone develops above the Pacific and heads westward towards the West coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches to Also-California, it flows the southwest of the United States with heavy tropical humidity as a tropical storm.
On Monday, the storm can bring up to 25 cm of precipitation to some areas of Mexico.
Then, meeting with the nearest low air pressure masses will cause hot rainfalls in the next days in the southwest.
Here the 3-10 cm precipitation can cause sudden floods, floods filled with debris, in the desert landscapes.
The heavy tropical humid can also bring 5 to 8 cm precipitation per hour, especially in the southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, precipitation is also expected between 5 and 10 cm, especially in Arizona.
Sudden flows may also occur, with rapid decreasing strength due to the slight nature of tropical rains.
During tropical rains, it is not recommended to walk on the desert.
Due to severe rainfalls, canyons can become crawling rivers, and the zivaries are accompanied by sudden wind blows and dust clouds at a location.
The nearest low air pressure masses can cause severe raining in the southern California coast.
Up to 1.5 cm precipitation is possible, which can cause smaller floods filled with debris, and flat roads.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Fantastic tropical soups can come to Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, then on Monday and on Tuesday, raining covers wider areas.
Serious rainfall spreads on Tuesday to the Four Columns region and lasts on Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States, as arctic air masses cool, but tropicals remain quite warm.
This can also cause drastic temperature differences in short distances.
This is an excellent example of the situation in the middle of the States on Sunday.
Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) are close to 10 degrees of temperature difference.
In the coming days, it is expected that the summer warm will be felt again in larger areas.
In the middle and eastern areas of the United States, it is expected to be warm in the first half of October, and the temperature is about 25 to 30 degrees from the southern part of the Great Shift to some parts of the Northwest.
The temperature in New York will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than the average.
The long-term weather forecast suggests that the temperature in the eastern parts of the States will exceed the average temperature until the first half of October.
More than 20 million looked at Brett Kavanaugh
In total, over 20 million viewers on six TV channels followed inquire about the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of rape in the eighteenth century, Christine Blasey Ford.
At the same time, the political patch situation was not resolved, and broadcasters had to break the normal broadcasting course due to the last-minute Friday screw: Jeff Flake was able to make it available to the FBI for a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that he was 100% sure that at the time of a high school party, Kavanaugh was captured and tried to take it off.
In his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said that 100 percent of them were sure that this did not happen.
The statements reported by Nielsen were probably seen by more than 20.4 million audiences on Friday.
Nielsen was calculated with the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of other channels that mediated the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen is difficult to measure the number of those who watch the shows at their workplace.
For the sake of comparison, so many viewers are used to be soccer winners or Oscar awards donor.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, who promoted Kavanaugh’s appointment, was the highest, on average 5.69 million viewers throughout the day.
In the second place, the ABC is with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS was 3,1, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89 and CNN 2,52 million, according to Nielsen’s report.
Interest was not reduced after the hearing.
The main character of the Friday drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderated Republican Senator's office issued the statement that Senator Kavanaugh had put the vox alongside the vox, Friday morning, the CNN and the CBS show appeared as the loud mass of protesters receives as he attempts to meet the Committee on Judicial Affairs.
He stood in eye for a few minutes while the mass was embedded, and CNN sent the scene in live broadcast.
“I stand here before you,” a woman told the Senator.
Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth before the public of the country?”
Others said, “You are in power to do what you don’t have for so many women.”
Flake only said that his office had issued a statement and then added before the elevator door was closed that he would share what he had to say at the hearing of the Commission.
The cable and broadcast channels were seen live hours later, as the Committee voted on whether Kavanaugh was elected to vote in front of the full Senate.
However, Flake said that he would only be willing to do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate next week, as the democrats in the minority had been urged.
Flake’s talks with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, were convinced of this need.
Flake decided to speak with Coons and later with other Senators.
He had the right power of the Flake, as it was clear that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve the candidate Kavanaugh.
President Trump launched a FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May is accused of the British Prime Minister of Political Championship of Brexit

Vulcan flows ash from Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
After the volcanic activity has increased in the crater and in total 183 gas and ash shots have occurred in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center has also observed more raining and retreats.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, the airscreens of the cars are covered by a thin ash layer.
Geographicians observed the increase in the activity of volcano from the capital of Mexico to 72 km southeast after a 7.1-strong earthquake shocked Mexico’s middle region in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police met with catalyst separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protesters of the Independence Party attacked the police and thousands joined the rival protests on the first anniversary of the Catalan referendum.
The group of subtle separatists threw them with eggs and paint powders, so the streets with other tourists were now covered with a dense dust paint.
In the later part of the day, there were more fights in which the police tried to maintain order with a rubber bin.
The "We do not forget, we did not forgive" slogans of independence and unit-party protesters behind the "Life Spain" slogan were facing each other for hours.
According to the local press, fourteen people were seen with minor injuries in protests.
The tension will not continue to be reduced in the area of independence in the region, which has been declared unlawful by Madrid, but celebrated by the Catalan Separatists on 1 October.
The voters voted by a huge majority in favour of a breakdown, although the participation rate was quite low, since most of the Unionists have boiled the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people suffered injuries last year when the police tried to stop voting in the voting positions with aggressive attacks.
Independence groups were on the street all Friday night to prevent demonstration supporting national police.
Although it was not possible to prevent it, the demonstration was eventually not on the normal route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, who participated in separatist protests, said there is no chance that Catalónia wins its independence.
“It was one of the best times in our life.
I saw my parents throw tears for what we can vote for, but now our case has gone down,” he said.
Although the regional elections in December last year have achieved an important, even if there is a narrow victory, it is difficult for the Catalan Independence Party to maintain their momentum this year after many of their most known leaders have been voluntarily exiled or are waiting for the court to judge their role in the organisation of the referendum and the proclamation of independence.
According to Joan Puig, 42-year-old automobile engineer, with the police protest phone, the conflict was fired on both sides of the politicians.
“The situation is more tense,” he says.
Last year, one of the Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who had been arrested for the negotiations, announced that he would be going to the European Parliament elections next year.
"I can reject the most democratic values and repression represented by the Spanish Government when I participate as a candidate in the European elections," he said.

With Menga's goal, Livingston won the Rangers team for 1 to 0
Dolly Menga's first goal assured Livingston's victory
Livingston recently entered the first class was a great surprise to the Rangers team by bringing Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, who has been working as a coach of the Ibrox club since the 18th game.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference because Gary Holt's team had died in a race with Hibernian team in the second place.
Gerrards continued to remain without foreign victory in the current season of Scotland League, and next Sunday they will face the first Hearts team in the first place to be missed by eight points.
Before that, however, there is still a game against Rangers on Thursday in Europe's Republic of Rapid Vienna.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased the series of divisional insolvency to six wins, which means that the Holt who resigned Kenny Miller in the last month has not yet gotten out with the team.
Livingston has missed many situations against the unprecedented guest team
Dead's team could have gotten the lead before the only goal of the game, because their attacking games have caused little trouble to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense of the opponent, but he overwhelmed the attack, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt was wider after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's ball crossed in front of the goal line.
The home team allowed Rangers to play their own game, as they were sure they could interfere with guests in fixed game situations.
The goal of fate was born from such a situation.
Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a hole in the defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who invented it from the mid-16s.
At this stage of the game, Rangers led in ball storage, however, domestic protection remained unbreakable, and Liam Kelly’s gates were hardly compromised.
This trend continued in the second half of the game, except for one situation when Kelly had to protect Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman tried the Rangers gate, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow lost the gate of Livingston from another free kick.
The cross-directed balls came to Livingston's sixteenth, but the defendants were thrown away every time. Two criminals were not received by the attacking team: one Halkett joined Glenn Middleton as the exchange player and the other were given the warranty.
"Fenomenal" game from Livingston – game analysis
Tony Macaroni from Argentina is Alasdair Lamont, a BBC Scotland reporter
Livingston provided phenomenon performance and leaned the beacons.
Players were excellent and overlooked the expectations.
The team’s members and game style have barely changed since they returned to the edge, but Holt’s efforts deserve a serious recognition, since the coach has been coming to the team very much.
Many players have also brought their best forms.
The team captain Halkett made a great deal of protection, and Menga swept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall properly.
Rangers played without idea.
As well as they are sometimes well involved in the leadership of Gerrard, they were now unable to bring that level.
The last shot has always been missing from the formula, however, only once they were able to break domestic protection, so Rangers must quickly get together because they slid back to the middle of the field.
Erdoğan found a mixed reception in Cologne
He described the morning meeting of Turkish and German leaders on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin.
This was the last day of his visit to Erdoğan in Germany, which was aimed at improving the relationship between NATO Member States.
The relationship between the two countries has deteriorated due to human rights, freedom of the press and the EU membership of Turkey.
Erdoğan then traveled to Cologne, a newly built, to open a huge mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks outside Turkey.
On the basis of security reasons, the police banned the gathering of 25 000 people before the mosque, but many of the president's supporters appeared to see the Turkish Head of State.
In addition, hundreds of protesters against Erdoğan, including many Kurds, expressed their disheartenment of Erdoğan’s policy and of the fact that the German government decided to welcome the Head of State.
The two contradictory protests are a great example of the division of the president’s policy, celebrated by some Turkish German citizens as a hero, while others see the autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: he hit a bicycle car and lost his life
He lost a bicycle's life when he crashed with a car in London.
The carambol was at the crossing of the Deptford high-speed road in the southeast of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, local time at about 10:15.
The driver of the passenger car stopped and the attackers tried to help the bicycle, but he lost his life on the spot.
The impact occurred only a few months after the death of another bicycle-bottle gas on Childers Street, just a mile away from the site of the Saturday accident.
According to the London Police, police continue to work to determine the identity of the man in order to inform the relatives.
Due to the investigation, road shutdowns and bus stations make traffic difficult, and the authorities advise car drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners injured during a confusion
Six prison guards were injured by a strictly guarded man in jail during disruptions, announced by the prison board.
The disruptions began on Sunday at 09:30 a.m. at the Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire, and have not yet been able to control them.

Long Lartin's men are held in prison for more than 500 prisoners, among whom the most dangerous criminals in the country can be found.
In June, the prison director had to be treated in hospital after one of the prisoners attacked.
Last October, the special government also needed help to disrupt a serious confusion in which the prisoners were attacked by biliary balls.
Rosa hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (but the situation of droughts can improve)
Arizona is rarely achieved by tropical depression, but it is expected that the state should count this at the beginning of the next week when the remnant of the hurricane crucified into Rosa crossing the desert in the southwestern country, increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has ordered flood preparations from Western Arizona to the southern and eastern part of Nevada, as well as the southern areas of California and Utah; the preparation also affects the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The hurricane Rosa is expected to travel directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring great rains with you.
The phoenix meteorological service published the following message on Twitter: “The ten tropical Cyclones have been reached within the 200 miles of Phonenix in the form of tropical storm or depression since 1950!
For example, Katrina hurricane (1967) approached the border of A.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict 50-100 mm precipitation, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the southwest desert areas (the central areas of the Rocky Mountain, the Great Basin, etc.), it can be counted as a precipitation of 25 to 50 mm, but it can fall 100 mm in some places.
The rain brought by Rosa can bring relief to areas that are not threatened with village, as the area is currently under severe dryness.
Despite the serious danger of flooding, some of the rains can have a beneficial effect on the southwest lands fighting the ahotel.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Service, more than 40% of Arizona’s territory suffers from minimal extreme dryness, which is considered to be the second most dangerous category,” says Weather.com.
The Hurricane Rosa will first be on the coast of the Also-Califonia peninsula in Mexico.
It remains hurricane and brings 137 km/h on Sunday morning and reaches about 600 km south of the Mexican Punta Eugenia land language and reaches approximately 19 km/h north.
The storm meets colder flows in the Pacific and will lose its power.
Thus, the coasts of Mexico are expected to reach again as a tropical storm in Monday afternoon or evening hours.
In some areas of Mexico, dense raining can be expected, which significantly increases the chance of flooding.
"The rains can mean 70-150 mm of precipitation from Also-California to the northwestern part of Sonora, where there may be 250 mm of precipitation," the weather.com report.
Rosa then proceeds as a tropical storm to the north of Mexico before reaching Arizona’s border in Tuesday morning hours, by now in the form of tropical depression, so that Arizonan is swept through Tuesday night to southern Utah.
“The biggest threat caused by Rosa and its remains in Also-Califonia, Northwest Sonor, and the expected extraordinary rain in the southwest desert areas of the United States,” the National Hurricane Centre said.
Rainfalls are expected to lead to life-threatening floods and horticulture flows in desert areas, and should be kept from landscapes in mountain areas.

“Whoever votes for Judge Kavanaugh, the Democrat Party votes against the ruthless and disgusting tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in the city of Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh’s candidate had to “experience and anger of the Democrat Party.”
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, where he firmly and passionfully denied Christine Blasey Ford's claim that the man committed sexual violence by decades earlier, as a teenager.
During the hearing, Ford also witnessed and stood in favour of his previous claims.
On Saturday, the president said that “americans were seen with their own eyes” on the day of Kavanaugh’s “brilliant and incredible character.”
“Alongside Judge Kavanaugh’s voks led by one of the most outstanding legal professionals of our time, who has an impeccable public service history,” Trump announced to the West Virginia supporters.

Hundreds of people died in a fleet caused by an Indonesian earthquake, the number of dead is rising
Many people have lost their price, and at least 384 people lost their lives when the huge waves reached the coast. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and escaper on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival held in the city of Palu on Friday, when nearly six feet (18 feet) of high waves reached the beach at the altar, many were flooded and destroyed everything that came into their way.
The escape price was triggered by an earthquake of 7.5 strength.
“When the escaper observation was said yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach, did not escape, so the waves became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian disaster control agency (BNPB) at the Jakarta press conference.
“The escape price came not only in itself, cars, tails, houses and all the other things from the beach,” Nugroho added, that the tsunami went on the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
There were those who climbed up to the top of the trees from the price, and were saved, said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters please.
In the air recordings published by the Agency, there are many destroyed buildings and business locations, more twisted and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by additional retreats.
The earthquakes could be perceived in the area where around 2.4 million people live.
According to the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT), in the course of the Friday earthquake, about 200 times more energy was released than the nuclear bomb dropped to Hiroshima in World War II.
The Agency added that the city was located at the end of a long and narrow Bay and that the geographical conditions resulting from it could strengthen the impact of the fountain.
Nugroho said the damage was “significant”, thousands of houses were destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were collapsed.
More victims were found among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, said, and then added that the number of wounded has been 540, and that they are looking for 29 more.
Nugroho said that the number of damages and damage caused in the area called Donggala could be even higher in the 300 km (190 mi (190 km) coastal area from Palu, as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication was “fullly paralyzed, cannot be informed about Donggala,” Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300 000 people there,” the Red Cross Communication announced that the organization’s professionals and volunteers are already on their way to the area affected by the disaster.
“The situation is already tragic, but it can be even worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the Agency received many criticisms regarding the lack of information to the population about the escape price of Palut, but the management said the waves were already on the coast when the alarm was released.
One of the amateur recordings shared on social pages is seen by a man who attempts to warn the people on the street with desperate screams from the top floor of a building.
Within a few minutes, a huge waterwall strikes the beach, driving cars and buildings.
The Reuters news agency has not yet been able to prove the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and the escape price have caused electricity shortages, making it impossible to communicate around Palu, so that the authorities can also harder coordinate rescue work.
The Army shipped an aeroplanes from Jakarta and other cities, but according to the authorities, the evacuated population will continue to need food and other essential needs articles.
The airport of the city was opened only in order to promote aid work and is closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the evacuation centres set up by Please on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian escaper exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
The World Vision team safely arrived from Donggala to Palu, where the employees found shelter under the tents set in the office court, but during their journey they met the trails of terrible destruction, said Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he added.
“It’s very bad.”
While the aid teams had access to the preparation of disaster response work, some complained that foreign professionals with great experience in this area could not travel to Palura.
According to Indonesia’s regulations, all overseas support, assistance and staff may be allowed to enter the territory of the country only if the location of unhappy is declared an area of disaster at national level.
This hasn't happened so far.
“The case continues to be treated as a catastrophe at the level of the county,” said Aulia Arriani, one of the spokespersons of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
As the government acknowledges that it is indeed a national disaster, we can allow international aid services, but no notification has been made.”
On the second night of Friday’s treason and escape, please, friends and family members of the disappeared have continued to hope that their loved ones will also be among those who have some light on the dark mood of reports about natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the channel.
On Sunday, the workers managed to release a woman who had two days in front of her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national squirrel umbrella team, prepared two competitors of the missing squirrel umbrellas at the beginning of the month, which was organized in Indonesia this time.
In addition to the disappeared, other disciples were camped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a cylinder on Veteran, what happened is a great spiritual burden on me,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when news about the collapse of Roa Roa Roa Hotel began to spread between cylinders, he desperately tried to reach the competitionrs who were attending the beach festival for hours, please.
However, in addition to the messages, two blue beans appeared only one grey bean.
“I don’t know, this means that the messages could not be delivered anymore,” he said.

Kanye West: Rapper's name changed to Ye
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye from now on.
The change was reported on Twitter on Saturday with the following message: “The being previously called Kanye West.”
For some time, the 41-year-old West was called Ye Beceneven, and the eighth album released in June was the title.
He announced the change of name before Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce a new album Yandhi.
In the show, Ariana Grande takes over the place, who renounced his role for "sensitive reasons", said the producer of the show.
The new name is not only a shortening of the current artist name of the rapper, according to its previous revelations, it has a religious significance for West.
“I know that “Ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you”,” West mentioned earlier when he spoke to the radio director of Big Boy’s album’s title.
So I'm you and I'm all one and we're all one.
Kanye means the only one, and it became only Ye, which represents the good in us, the evil, the disruption, everything.
The album instead reflects who we really are.”
Ye is one of those famous rappers who have special love to change their name.
For example, Sean Combs has been running in the name of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he has announced that he now prefers the names of Love and Brother Love.
West’s former composer, JAY-Z, also varied several times by the fact that his name should be written together, with a link, or a big deal.
The Mexican president admitted that he would not take the army against civilians.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican president, made a promise that he would never take force against civilians on the next 50th anniversary of the student sentences in the blood bath.
López Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco, promised that “he would never use the army to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military teams opened fire to participants in a peaceful demonstration, causing about 300 deaths, when left student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young people in Mexico – he grants monthly financial grants to students and plans to establish additional free public universities.
He argued that lack of unemployment and education are the two main factors that lead young people to the arms of criminal organisations.
The US should double the financing framework for MI solutions
As China becomes increasingly active in research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its support for such research, announced Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and employee of artificial intelligence solutions that previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He then said that the U.S. government made notifications about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, China also announced its related plans: the country aims to become the world’s first MI developer by 2030.
“Double the cost framework for MI research would be a good start, because all other countries are significantly down compared to the United States and the next breakthrough in the area of MI,” Lee said.
By duplicating research subsidies, the possibility could also increase twice the chance that the United States could take the next major step in the field of artificial intelligence, announced in the CNBC interview.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month in the care of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures. The company made investments in China’s most significant MI company in Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon was working on a MI system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player, and later acted as a Microsoft Research Director, and as a chairman of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of the technology competitions previously published by the US government, including DARPA Robotics Challenge, and he was interested in the time when the next event would be held, because at this time it would be possible to explore new future designers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get the state support needed for their research, said Lee.
“China is not oxidising scientific leaders, but large companies,” he added.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been writing several major university skulls over the past few years to work in the field of MI.
Lee believes that by changing immigration policy, the US's efforts to artificial intelligence could be greatly helped.
“I think you should automatically receive a green card to those who have a doctoral degree in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council announced its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The National Science Fund of China provides support to the staff of academic institutions in the same way as the American National Scientific Fund (NSF) and other government organizations share money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, explained by Lee.
This year, the American Ministry of Defence established the MI Center for Joint Artificial Intelligence, where various industry professionals and academics can work together and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
During this month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an AI Next initiative,
The NSF currently spends $100 million a year in support of MI research.
Meanwhile, the law of the United States, which designed a National Security MI committee, has not taken further steps for the purpose of the matter for months.
In Macedonia, a referendum on changing the name of the country is held.
The population of Macedonia voted in the Sunday referendum on whether the country's name would be changed to the "Fear-Macedón Republic". By this step, a debate would be resolved with Greece for decades, which prevented the adoption of the country's request for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, whose territory is called Macedonia, argued that its northern neighbour's name indicates that he is demanding a similar Greek area, so far that the country's NATO and EU membership has been protected.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement on the new name of the state, but according to national emotional opponents, the ethnic identity of the population of Macedonia is mostly undermined by the change of name.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the launched bojkott campaign, it became doubtful whether the 50% participation rate required for the current referendum was reached.
The issue on the voting banners is as follows: ‘Do you support NATO and EU membership of the country and accept the agreement with Greece?’
The supporters of the name change, with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price should be paid in order to make it possible for Macedonia, one of the countries raised by the Roma of Yugoslavia, to be a member of the EU and NATO.
“I’m here today to vote for the future of the country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it would be a safer life for all of us,” Olivera Georgijevska (79) said.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, a sufficient member of the Parliament has declared that it feels mandatory for itself the outcome of the vote.
There are two-thirds of the Parliament's need to change the name.
According to the State Election Committee, no notification of irregularities was received until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate has reached only 16% to this point. This value was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which eventually participated 66% of the voters registered).
“I came to vote for my children because our place is for us in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who gave up his vote in Skopje, the capital.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, Wife Zorica and their son Dushko, have made their voks in Strumica, on the 30 September 2018 referendum, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skopje, before the building of Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage and chairs and tents for the people's vote for the Bojkottators.
“We also support NATO and EU membership of the country, but we would be proud to join with a high head and not through the court door,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If you don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, you can also turn to China or Russia as part of the eurázsia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership could be counted with investments in Macedonia that the country with more than 20% of unemployment needs.
“I think that the majority will support our case because more than 80% of the population in the country fundamentally supports EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said.
He added that the "yes" vote means "insure the future of the country".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, 30-43% of the voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
According to another study conducted by Macedón Telma TV, the participation rate of 57% is expected on Sunday.
For those who want to vote, 70% said they would vote with yes.
To ensure that the referendum is valid, the participation rate should be at least one vote.
The invalidity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the West Coast Government, which took power in May of last year.

Scherzer wants to make Rockies harder.
Since the Nationals team misses the opportunity to get to the afterseason, they had no reason to make a real effort.
But Scherzer, a always competing spirit, can hardly wait to stand on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the opponent team still has a chance to play it. Rockies is a game advantage in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Baseball League.
Rockies secured at least one invigorating place with the victory against the Nationals on Friday night, however, the acquisition of their first division title is still waiting for you.

Of course I want to get on the track like this."
The Nationals team still has to choose the starter for Sunday, but news is that Scherzer will be the drummer in this position.

Trump is campaigning in Western Virginia
The President also referred to the situation in Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Judge when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“In November, everything we have done is at risk.
We are only five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the big ones, and I’m not going personally, but I’m going to go, and that’s why I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “Everybody can see what these terrible, radical groups are doing with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and they are able to take any means to regain power, see maliciousness and abusiveness.
It doesn’t matter who is harmed, who is slandered to have control in their hands, to have power. This is what they want, control, and power, but we do not leave ourselves.”
According to the president, the Democrats put in place a "standing and obstacle".
“They have seen all this in the last four days,” he said, “as angry and malicious and abusive and liar,” called Democrats.
According to his name, Dianne Feinstein mentioned the Senate Democratic Senator, a member of the Committee on Judicial Affairs of Senate, who heard the noise of the gathered mass.
“Do you remember what he answered?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
The Labour Party will no longer support diversity.
It does not tolerate those who are free to say what they think
I was not surprised when the activists of the Momentum decided in my own party for my censorship.
Finally, I am only the last in the long line of the working party representatives who were told that they were not welcome to see them simply because we said what we thought.
My fellow Member Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way as he had been against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor didn't like I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which, in an ironic way, is precisely the issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
At the invitation of the Nottingham East Working Party meeting on Friday, it was said that they would like a “introductory and productive meeting.”
As a local representative of the Labour Party, in most of my eight years, these Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
Today, however, the voice has changed, and the promise of “returned, more politic” policy has been forgotten if it has ever been realised.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views and that all opinions are judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple. My colleagues, with whom I thought, like our political attitude, in recent times, have been more and more expecting to turn back on my individual opinion and take a position on things that I would never agree with, whether it was a matter of national security or the single European market.
After all my public talks, regardless of what I have actually said, they are starting to sneak on the social sides, demanding my redemption, criticizing the central policy and informing me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Work Party.
This is not just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more lucky than many of my colleagues, because the comments I have received are usually struggling to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who are sexualist and racist attacks forced to stand on a daily basis, but they do not run.
The most disappointing aspect of our day’s policy is that such levels of attacks have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party must support the tolerance culture.
The reality, however, is that we have renounced diversity, and all the "insecurity" initiatives and any amendments to the electoral rules are increasingly limited in the party.
Over the last few years, many have advised me to hold myself back, not to be so pronounced, and then “all will be fine.”
But that’s why I didn’t go on a political path.
32 years ago, as a student, I joined the Work Party because it was advocate that the Thatcher government had so neglected schools that our classroom was almost slimming and then fighting for better public supply as a local adviser and minister of government.
I have never hidden my political views and did nothing else in the last election.
Nottingham East was completely clear for everyone, what political positions I represent, and which issues do not agree with the current leadership.
For those who have supported the proposal on Friday, I say in this situation when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will not only harm families, but also businesses and public services, I don’t understand why so much time and energy to question my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my most important message is not to the members of Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, regardless of whether they are members of the Work Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of any sort of redemption or political purpose does not impede me to act according to my own judgment and taking account of everyone's interests.

Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Ayr is unbeatable to the top
Two late attempts have changed somewhat in the same result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves a win at the most prominent game of the day on Tennent's Premiership.
The team is currently in the top of the tabella, the only unbeatable of the ten teams.
Due to their unparalleled protection and the use of their superior situation, they won, so the domestics and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to meet a challenge in our current games, but we are still unbeatable, so I have every reason for happiness,” he said.
Robyn Christie, the player of Melrose, said: “We need to know that Ayr has used his situation much better than we have.”
Grant Anderson experimented in 14 minutes, from which Frazier Climo scored, the Ayr benefited. Thanks to the yellow card of Rory Hughes borrowed by Warriors, Melrose could have dropped the difference, but the attempt of Jason Bagg was not a point.
Climo insisted on protecting Ayr with a criminal, just at the mid-term, and then gained a point from a single experiment, so the first half-term ended with 17-5 results for Ayr.
Melrose strongly started the second semester, Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Baggot, reducing the disadvantage of the team to five points.
Then the game stood for a long time, as Ruaridh Knott suffered severe injury and had to take it off the track, and in the course of the resume, Ayr continued to increase its advantage by attempting Stafford McDowall, whose beans were taken out by Climo.
Blair Macphererson, Captain Ayr, got a yellow card, and then Melrose managed to prevent Bruce Colvine's experiment in human light, breaking the pressure on them.
The home team began to close again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for installing Climo without a ball, MacPherson introduced a touch down from the criminal line behind the Ayr attacking team.
Climo sold it almost immediately after the re-starting, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the home.
Still Game's main character started a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's star, Ford Kieran, seems to be moving towards the restaurant industry: it was clear that a restaurant was placed in the top of the company.
56-year-old actress Jack Jarvist plays in the BBC's popular series, which he writes together and in which he works with his old comic partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next nineth year will be the final year, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he was the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress did not comment on the news, although Scottish Sun’s source suggested that Kiernan is trying to benefit from Glasgow’s “prosperous hospitality industry”.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without the beach hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patroling the naval command decorated by the sailors in La Paz.
In the centers, ocean blue flags fly.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon advocate the following motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to get back."
In Bolivia without the coast, the memories of the lost coast still live sharply, which Chile has taken in a bloody conflict in the XIX century, for resources, and strongly live in the desire to regain the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been the most effective for many decades, since Bolivia is waiting for the second October of the International Court to close five years of discussion.
“The ball is at Bolivia, which flows with the spirit of bondage and peace to people waiting for the end development in a positive mood,” Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivia diplomat.
Many Bolivias follow the decision of the International Court, hopefully that the Hague Court stands in Bolivia, and after decades of rapsodic attitudes, Chile will be obliged to sit on a negotiating table to get access to the sea by Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is looking forward to a controversial fight that he must continue for the next year’s reelection, can lose a lot with Monday’s judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts think that the court will probably not decide for Bolivia, and that would not change the situation much if its decision would still be favourable to Bolivia.
The United Nations Council in the Netherlands has no right to judge over the areas of Chile and has made it in advance that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court was born in just six months after the closing talks indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a chilei expert in international law.
In addition, the past four years did not help Bolivia, but even put it back.
“The issue of sea exit was replaced by the current Bolivia government for its own purposes,” Zarate explained.
Because of Morales’ hostile retoric, the rest of the chiles have gone away.”
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue the negotiations at a point, but it will be extremely difficult to start dialogue after what happened.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia, disagrees with the finding that judicial decision-making would have been unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia has a “exclusive opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile” and the chance that both come well from the end of the 139 years of conflict,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the marine debate to make it a political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific,” she added.
“The judgment gives us the opportunity to see: it’s time to go beyond the past.”
North Korea: no nuclear dismantling until they can trust in America
According to North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho, his country will not be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made by the leaders of the two rival countries at the Singapore Summit.
The comment was made when the American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo was able to re-start the closed nuclear discussions, over three months after the North Korean leader Kim Dzsongun held the Singapore Summit.
According to Ri, “I want” to believe that the U.S. obstruction of constant sanctions and Korean war will ever be enough to force North Korea on the knee.
Washington suffers from accepting the statement if Phenjan does not take significant steps towards dismantling.
Both Kim Dzsongun and President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, a wide range of skepticism embraces Phenjan’s commitment to dismantling the arsenal, which is likely to be the only key to the security of the country.
Pompeo plans a phenjan visit next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows appeared in the huge headlights that will soon appear in top-class shops.
If you want to expand your hammer collection or want to completely cover the day, you don’t have to search for it any longer.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized head covers as part of their spring/summer collection in 2019, which was welcomed by the Paris fashion seven-style audience with great enthusiasm.
Instagram was created by non-practical hats during the summer, and the above fashion designers also put their attention-remarkable works on the run-up.
Valentino’s most spectacular piece was an extinct bee hat that was feathered, wide karima decorated and almost completely absorbed in the head of the models.
Among the other oversized supplements appeared with a precious stone, a magical hat, even ananas that were not really designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also had a bizarre selection of masks, even before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks were sewing their mouths together, and they reminded Hannibal Lecter rather than the haute couture.
One of these pieces looked like a dive mask, plus a pipe and glasses, and another painted like a melting ice cream.
If you come in with these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
According to the prediction of style analysts, huge hats are already on their way to top-class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path "La Bomba", a 60 cm wide chariman bark that we have seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Cultural bearing behind the social sides, which is a little practical, presented another piece on the runner: a shaft of a salvage, which is almost as much as the bathing suit model.
The dark orange raphia bag, decorated by raphiaboots, and on top there is a white leather sticker, was one of the outstanding pieces of the Jacquemus collection of La Riviera in spring/ summer 2019 in Paris.
The stylist of the stars, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: “I expect that in the summer, huge hats and beach bags appear in the top-class dress shops. The designer has an elementary effect on everyone that it would be difficult to deny the demand for over-size supplements.”
John Edward: Language Knowledge is essential for world citizens
Scotland independent schools traditionally provide excellent education. In view of the new outstanding exams, this situation has not changed until 2018, which is further enhanced by individual and group successes achieved in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are already studying in such institutions as the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which aim to provide students and parents the best possible services.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for further learning, higher education, their chosen careers and the position they play as citizens of the world.
In a educational sector where it is possible to design and introduce customized school curriculums, we see that modern languages remain popular and sought subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak in a language that you understand, it will come to his head.
But if you speak in his language, it reaches your heart.”
This is an important reminder because we cannot rely on English simply if we want to build relationships and trust with other countries.
From this year’s exams, students from independent schools have produced the best results from foreign languages across the country.
68% of all students studying foreign language reached higher degrees (more than 85%).
Based on the data gathered from SCIS 74 member schools, 72% of students received higher degrees from mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69. France and 63% of Spanish students reached the A degree.
These results also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages as essential knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need to know in the future.
Today, languages as selected objects have become as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics as well as independent and other schools.
The 2014 survey of the United Kingdom Committee on Employment and Training has shown that 17% of employers have faced difficulties due to the lack of language knowledge.
We can also see that language knowledge becomes increasingly necessary for young people to run a successful career.
As foreign languages are increasingly expected to be familiar with workplaces, language knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when he learns foreign language, he gains lifelong-standing knowledge that gives a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationals will automatically provide a competitive advantage to the applicants who speak in several languages.
According to YouGov’s survey, in which 4000 adults were asked in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% of respondents were unable to speak well in no foreign language and France was the only language spoken by more than 10% (15%) of respondents.
It is therefore important that we focus on children’s language learning.
Speaking in several languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children that can be better placed as adults to apply for more important work.
In Scotland, every school will deal with other languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will teach languages such as mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of outstanding importance for the UK by 2020.
Whatever the area of interest of the child, you will be able to learn more optional languages in independent schools and will be trainers who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and delivers them with the skills they need to succeed, to maintain anything in the future.
It is not difficult to note that in the current global business environment, languages remain vital for the future of a country, and that education should reflect this.
In fact, the knowledge of modern languages should rather be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools offer choice, diversity and quality education for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien is fair – that's how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron San Diego presents Lakers on Sunday
They don't have to wait long for fans sitting on needles to see LeBron James get on the track first in Los Angeles Lakers' colors.
The coach of Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play at the pre-season opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you're going to spend on the track, it's still a question.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton wrote on Lakers’ official website.
The reporter of Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James would probably play for a limited time.
After a few days ago, James was asked what his plans for Lakers in the six-year pre-season.
“I don’t have to play at this point of my career in the pre-season to be ready,” he replied.
Trump’s Western Virginia campaign and YouTube channel
Donald Trump Wheeling, Western Virginia, starts a long series of campaign events tonight.
This will be the first of Trump’s five injured events next week, including such stops as Tennessee and Mississippi, who supports him.
Now that Trump has been postponed to the liberated position of the Supreme Court, Trump is trying to collect supporters for the next semi-term elections, as there is a risk that Republicans lose power over the Congress when the votes run in November.
When will Trump begin tonight’s Western Virginia event, and where can you follow it online?
The talk of Trump wheelingi (Nyugat-Virginia) will begin at 7 pm on September 29, 2018 on Saturday, Eastern time.
You can follow Trump’s Western Virginia meeting online through YouTube’s live mediation.
Trump will probably touch his Supreme Court Deputy, Brett Kavanaugh this week's hearing, which was particularly stressed in the light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate's confirmatory vote was suspended for a week until the FBI investigated.
However, the primary objective of the sudden increase in events is to help the Republicans position before the November elections.
Trump’s campaign adviser said that the next five events will serve to activate voters and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority currently owned in Senate and the Assembly,” Reuters wrote.
“To know the management of the Congress in your hands, the critical point of its political plans is that the President is visiting as many states as possible. We look at the time of a dense campaign period,” said Reuters, a campaignist requesting the silence of his name.
Wesbanco Arena wheeling events are scheduled for the evening: “You can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania states, and you can also enter the posts of the media of Pittsburgh,” says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who, according to the surveys, is not in a favourable position.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should intervene personally to be more involved in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: the U.S. team struggles with full shoulder width in front of Sunday individuals to keep hope alive
After three unilateral attempts, the fourth match on Saturday afternoon needed the Ryder coupe.
The squeezing shirt of luck and momentum here-oda is a fairly aired sports cluster, yet every player believes in it, mostly in competitions like Ryder cup.
So who has the ball now?
“They had six-point leadership, and they had only four advantages, so we can say that we have the ball,” Jordan Spieth said, as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, with four points, Europe still leads, and it is still available for twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth tells, feel that they have finally received a little backbone, and can build encouragement from more than anything, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both got three points out of the four.
Spieth proved inevitable from the start-up to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His fisting winning screams became increasingly louder, as he went forward with the circle, invented and balanced with a critical rotation in the fourth match, so that he and Thomas were in dual disadvantages after two.
The game's deciding has resulted in similar joys of the 15th hole, a kind of kind that can believe the viewer that everything is lost to the American team.
“You just have to dig deep in yourself and only take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
This is exactly what is still waiting for players.
18 holes for the chance to leave a trail.
During the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular couple of Ryder coupons could get more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe has brought four out of four of them, and it seems that they can’t make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not perform over the par on Saturday afternoon, and Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday's last nine stages.
Thanks to the dynamics developed between this series, and the audience who supported them and them, they became the meter on Sunday, and no one expects more than anyone to assure Europe's victory on the Le Golf National track than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best thing is winning at the same time with different holes.
However, it would be early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon executed Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning when he played with Alex Noren.
Once with one and two hits above the par, the first nine holes were filled by Spanish and Swedish, which brought them into a wave valley, where they had no chance to climb.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of your hole.
Four ball games and four matches are very entertaining, thanks to the interactions of the couples. You can watch what advice you give, what you don't give, and how the strategy can change during an eyelash.
Europe has played a better team so far, and it has a significant advantage for the last day, but this fourth section has shown that the American team has the need for curass and lacked many of them, especially from the American side.
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10-6.
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder cup with a great advantage after closing the four-ball and four-game games against the United States with 10-6 results.
The intensive Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari double led the hair, winning two wins against the weakening Tiger Woods, raising the difference to four points on the Le Golf National track.
Thomas Bjørn’s European team, who tries to get back the Trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the continuously defective American team during the four ball matches in the morning, winning the series for 3-1.
America demonstrated greater resistance during the fours, bringing two matches, but they couldn’t make the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should get eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel who won four points in the series, while he and Molinari, who are only mentioned as "Malliwood" after a sensation weekend, the second pair of the history of Ryder coupe, which received four points on the opening match.
Once Woods-Patrick Reed was beaten in four balls, they defeated the unmotivated Woods and the U.S. Newman Bryson Dechambeau for a definite 5+4.
Woods, who was dragging himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes even aggravated his talent, but from 29 games, has already lost 19 of the four balls and four, of which seven times.
Justin Rose, who rested during the four balls in the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third position of the World Brigade, by 2+1.
However, Europe did not succeed in all this pleasant, slice day, from Paris to southwest.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the three-time address protector, showed the Americans how to do this.
A torture-served 2&1 victory was won against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls, and later they returned to defeat Poultert and Rory McIlroyt in 4+3 proportions after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder cup, only twice a team managed to come back from the four-point disadvantage in individual competitions, although Furyk’s titlekeeper team is infinitely enough to keep the trophy.
However, after only two days they were the second best, a Sunday attack seems rather unrealistic.
"It's closed" to unanimize North Korea if you don't trust your negotiating partner.
The Secretary of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said to the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions only increased the unconfidence of the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would unilaterally surrender nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongho said at the World Organisation’s Annual Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant and high-quality steps” over the last year, such as shut down nuclear and missile tests, closed the site of nuclear experiments and promised that it would not expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
“We do not see similar responses from the Americans,” he said.
“We feel that our nation’s security is not guaranteed, and in such circumstances it is excluded from being unanimous and first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea’s disappointment in Washington’s opposition to the idea of "special" nuclear dismantling, which was in the scenario that would be awarded the benefits of North Korea’s so far, his statement seemed to be significant because he did not clearly reject the unilateral nuclear dismantling as Phenjan has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Dzsongun and Donald Trump at the first summit of the past, between the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June and during which Kim promised to work on the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula, while Trump guaranteed the inviolence of North Korea.
North Korea aims to be able to officially do so at the end of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States believes Phenjan must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington did not allow strict international sanctions in North Korea.
“America insists on starting with nuclear dismantling, and sanctions increase pressure to force her will to us, and also oppose it to declare the end of the war,” Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can force us on the knees is a desire for people who don’t know us.
The problem is that non-reliant sanctions only increase our suspicion."
Ri did not mention that it would be a plan for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which, however, the President of the United States has spoken separately in the beginning of the week.
The minister pointed out that three meetings took place between Kim and the South Korean President Mun Dzsein in the last five months, and added: “If the country involved in nuclear installations were South Korea and not the United States, then the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula would not have been in such a position.”
However, the voice of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the targeting of the North American continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump, the wicked President, Kimet, called it a “rava man” who is on a suicide mission.
During this year, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “full destruction” last year, praised Kimet for having the courage to take steps towards dismantling, but also noted that there was a lot of work left, and the sanctions remain until North Korea executes nuclear installation.
On Wednesday, Trump said they didn’t set the time limit, i.e. “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argued that the United Nations Security Council could reward Phenjan for the steps taken so far.
On the other hand, U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo said in the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions of the Security Council must be disrupted until they have achieved the actual, final, proven nuclear dismantling.”
The Security Council has maintained sanctions against North Korea unanimously since 2006 in order to reduce financing of Phenjan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Rív at the break of the UN General Assembly and then said he would go back to Phenjan in the next month to prepare the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
After he left Phenjan in July, he announced that progress was made, however, North Korea accused him of “gengster-like claims” hours later.
In the course of the meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promised to land a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States also takes “the proper steps.”
According to Mun, the “smart steps” mentioned by Kim would be security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps that could lead to the normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to rest enough
This year, Harvard University’s new curriculum has curtailed students for several sleeps, fighting the whole nightly learning of caffeine to gain more and more space for its macho culture.
Academic concluded that students of the world’s first university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care about themselves.
The course that he believed was the first such training in the United States was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who taught sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical College and practised as a doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged the development of the course to have a lecture in the past on the impact of sleeping intake on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, “Why am I faced with it just now, at the end?”
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleep that surprised me,” he told Telegraph.
During the first course launched this year, students will be informed of the fundamental impact of proper sleeping habits on their study and sports performance, except that they have a positive impact on their overall mood.
According to Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard University of Medicine and Director of the Health Service of the University, the university decided to start the course because in the week, students were found to be exceptionally unawashed.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
For example, one of them shows a picture of a college room where students can click on cafés, curtains, gymnastics and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance affects sleeplessness and why it is important to sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleeping is increasing the risk of developing a heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
They show the map of the interactive icons in the university area that the participants are scrutinized to reconsider the daily routine.
“We know we will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to these knowledge – as well as they have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
It continues to flourish in the culture, in which performance is considered to be a lifetime learning, he said, adding that contemporary technology and students’ constantly increasing pressure causes more and more problems of sleeplessness.
A sufficient and quality sleep is the “secret weapon” of students in fighting stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even protects from obesity, as sleeping is forced into the way the brain is hungry and causes a constant hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler in the design of the course, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemistry and biophysics and took one of the courses in Harvardon last year.
He said that they heard the eyes were opened and encouraged to start a university-level training.
He hopes that, as a next step, postgraduate students will be able to participate in a similar training programme before being placed in the competition sector.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alert to sleep, wake up and meet the harmful effects of the electric screens and the “blue light” issued by LED light sources, which can easily remove them from the daily rhythm and make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1–0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and gets a goal
Rangers suffered another foreign defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb drove Steven Gerrard's team into a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The ibroxians tried to win their first foreign victory after the 4-1 victory of February, St. Johnstone, but Gerrard has suffered the second defeat of Gary Holt’s 18-year-old team, leading as manager. So they will stay eight points away from the first position of the Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish Championship), the Hearts.
Menga hit me seven minutes before the mid-term, and the unmotivated team of Rangers didn't even fit into equalization.
While Rangers slipped to the sixth place, Livingston got caught up to the third, leaving Hibernian behind because of the goal difference.
Rangers can also face additional difficulties after the need for medical care due to the head injury of the coastal display Calum Spence, probably due to a disposable object from the guest viewer.
Gerrard also changed eight points on the team that came into the Betfred cup's predecessor with Ayr's cut.
Dead went on to the same 11 people in Livingston, who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would certainly be happy to watch the team of his perfectly tailored, strangled his opponent's game wherever he was.
Although Rangers led in a ball store, Livingston took more of what he bought.
The first two minutes you could have gotten a goal when you started Scott Pittman to the gates of Allan McGregor, but the midwayer failed to sell the chip.
Keaghan Jacobs was a low-sharing fire at Craig Halkett's team captain, but the defendant Alan Lithgow just found the side of the gate.
Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than self-confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved a criminal at the 15th minute when he interacted with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson could make his complaints in Colombia.
Rangers could only show two first semester shots, but the former Ibrox gate, Liam Kelly, was hardly a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi's attempts faced the game in 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserve the chance, only for their hard work.
Rangers again missed a ciccer forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react in time when Declan Gallagher put the ball on Scott Robinson, who was great to find Menga for the easy finish.
Gerrard decided to switch Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately explained its impact on the game when the extreme Morelost jumped, but Kelly blocked the impressive form in time.
Livingston continues to play a game that matched him and Lithgow and Halkett swept the long balls afterwards.
The Dead team could have had a bigger advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net well and smashed Jacobs' position before Lithgow had grown from a angle.
As the Rangers exchange, Glenn Middleton tried to fight another eleven when he broke up with Jacobs, but Thomson was not convinced.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger Counter
A detail of our "week morning" almanach: September 30, 1882, now just 136 years ago... the day when the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that could result in a device known as the Geiger Counter.
The Geiger accountant has since been one of the basic tools of science, and thanks to the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado”, which included the strange cowboy scientists, Roy Rogerst and Dale Evanst, became part of the pop culture:
The man said, “What is this miracle?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger accountant. Radioactive minerals, such as uranium, can be sought with him.
If you put this headphone, you can hear the sound of the atoms released because of the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans says, “Here you listen, he's kind of crawling.”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention of his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “infect the abnormal cells”
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "lase" and destroy abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of treatment will teach the immune system to detect abnormal cells.
It is part of the method that the immune cells should be extracted from the patient and then changed in a laboratory.
This way they can “see” the protein that is accompanied by a variety of cancers. The treated immunocells are reinjected into the patient.
A experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells has said goodbye to her ovaries for more than 18 months.
It is part of the method of obtaining immunocells from the patient; their modification in the laboratory to “see” the protein called HER2, which is a common accompanyer of various types of cancer disease; then the reintroduction of cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the American Institute for Discovery (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results allow us to conclude that we have a very promising vaccine.”
The HER2 “stemplifies the growth of multiple types of cancer”, including breast, ovaries, lungs, and vertebrates, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method that is based on highlighting immunocells and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has been used successfully in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
Kanye West SNL, wearing the MAGA cap, has been summoned in a trumpet-supporting tire.
It's not going too well.
Kanye West was swept in the Saturday Night Live studio after an unconsistent manifestation in which he spoke to President Donald Trump and then told him to apply for the presidential position in 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, Make America Great Again, he began to speak against the Democrats and reiterates that Trump was backed up.
“Sometimes when I talk to someone who is white, she asks: “How can you like Trump, because she is a racist?”
If you were interested in racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show was opened by Matt Damon with a parodia in which the Hollywood star was struggling with Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Justice Committee on the sexual harassment of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West's speech was uploaded by Chris Rock's humorist on social sites.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to run a moth from West with the charge.
West also complained to the audience that he was smashed behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They were frightened behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out in that hat.”
I'm scared!
And they told me that I was in the drowned place," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see a new place? I wear my Superman rope because that means they can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to progress?
Try with love.”
His manifestations were at least twice haunted by a whisperer from the audience, and SNL’s players seem to feel embarrassed by one of the witnesses who declared Variety: “The whole studio was hidden in silence.”
West was invited to singer Ariana Grande at the last moment, whose former friend Mac Miller rapper died a few days before.
West asked questions, among other things, when the song I Love it was dressed for Perrier glasses.
Westet, head of the Conservative TPUSA Group, Candace Turner, assured his support in a tweet: “One of the bravest spirits: GOVERNMENTS, WHEN THE MINUGEL GOVERNED.”
Karen Hunter, host of a chat show, tweeted that West was simply “self and great.”
“But I have decided not to reward someone (with the purchase of music or fashion articles or the ‘art’), which I believe is an ideology that is harmful to the community I belong to.
He's free.
But we did," he said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, now he “the being known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's in Diddy's trails, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
Snoop Dogg also recorded the name of Snoop Lion and, of course, his former legend, Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
He is accused of killing the Belgian restaurant delayer.
A 45-year-old man is accused of killing attempts after a man was cut in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to the police statement, the case was in Ballyhackamore.
The accused must stand before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Trojans, finds exaggerated maleness harmful.
Kit Harington is most known as the Trojans’ struggle as Jon Snow, and in the middle-aged fantasy series of HBO violence itself often captures swords.
However, the 31-year-old actress spoke against the stereotype macho heroes, highlighting that, when such heroes see, young boys often feel that a hard action is needed to fight respect.
Kit said in his statement to The Sunday Times Culture that he said “something went wrong” and asked how to deal with the problem of the adverse effects of excessive malehood in the #MeToo era.
The star who recently married his 31-year-old, serial colleague, Rose Leslie, said that it would be very important to cure the problem.
“I am personally deeply affected by this matter — how was the deception of maleness so distorted?” asked the actor.
“What have we taught men when they were childish about the problem we are facing?”
According to Kit, the television is also responsible for the spread of a distorted image of maleness, as the shows often include very masculinous characters.
He added, “What is what was born with us, and what is what we learn?
What does the street and TV send to young boys, which makes them feel like men can only be like this?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change it.
Because it seems clearly that something is wrong with young men.”
Kit said in the interview that after the summer season of the series, there will be no feature in the series or continuation of the Thrones in the battle series or continuation of the series, because “he has had enough of the battles and the horses.”
From November, Kit Sam Shepard will play a main role in reprocessing his movie True West, which is about a producer and his brother who continues a robbery lifestyle.
The actress said that the best thing he got from the Trons fight is his wife, Rose, whom he knew when he made the series.
“I have met my wife in the shooting, so I can thank my future family and my life before me for the series,” Kit said.
Rose Ygritte, who was the character of Kit, Jon Snow, was the love of Emmy's award fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new patients increased by 14% in China
China announced that the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14% in the country.
Health officials say that this represents more than 820 000 people.
In the second quarter of 2018, the number of reported cases increased by approximately 40 000.
Compared to the previous ones, a significant majority of newly infected people receive the disease on a sexual basis.
In some parts of China, the disease spread rapidly.
However, at a conference held in Jünnan Province, health officials said that the number of such cases has decreased to nearly zero since then.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000 in China.
Sexual transfer of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LMBT community.
Homosexuality has not been considered a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against society has been very strong since then.
Based on the estimates in various studies, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men eventually marry a woman.
The disease spreads in these relationships in many cases due to inappropriate sexual protection.
The Chinese government has been providing universal access to medicines against HIV as part of the problem-solving programme since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that one of his members would have leaked the data of republican senators and condemned “hazardous lies” and “conspiration theories”
On Saturday, American representative Maxine Waters rejected the accusations that a member of his crew had published three Republican Senators' personal data on the Wikipedia site.
According to a representative of the Los Angeles Democrat, these claims were distributed by “extended” experts and websites.
"Life, lie, and more stubborn lies," Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information released was allegedly included by Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, as well as the address and telephone number of Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch Utah.
The information was released on Thursday on the internet. The person who published it is unknown, but it is sure that they were published on the Capitol dome, during the senate hearing of Brett Kavanaugh’s top candidate for sexual harassment.
The leak happened shortly after the three Senator Kavanaughs asked.
Conservative pages, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, can be associated with the IP address that can be identified as a source to Waters office, and they also communicated information about one of the members of Waters, written by The Hill.
“These charges are completely incomplete, false, and obviously liars,” Waters continued.
– My member is not responsible for leaking information. However, his right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security has been injured by fraudulent and liar accusations.
These accusations are completely incomplete, false, and obviously liars."
Waters' statements were quickly criticized on the internet. Among the critics was Ari Fleischer, the former press secretary of the White House.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
According to this, Waters does not have the blood levels required for its representatives.
If someone is suspected of something he didn't do, he can't react angryly.
You can't be dazzling.
You can't question the accusation's motives.
“You must remain calm and calm.”
Waters reacted to the response of Judge Fleischer Kavanaugh to the political criticisms, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, who applies to Waters as a Republican candidate in mid-term elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he wrote in his message.
Waters wrote in his communication that his office had notified “compliant authorities and police bodies” about false accusations.
“We make sure that the person of the perpetrators is exposed – continued Waters – and that they are legally liable for any action that threatens or damages any member of my staff.”
Johnny English hits again, or Rowan Atkinson's paranoid spy play
Today, we are looking for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there is no exception from this, the franchise that runs under the name Johnny English and is not included in the category of action warriors/parodians, whose first part, Johnny English in 2003, second, Johnny English, was reloaded in 2011.
Will the British nation become a new export product of sarcasm, self-paraoding satrites, in which we live on our own obvious paralysis?
It is so certain that the garbage stiff, rubber, incompetent Johnny English had enough ammunition for a new return – it is already known that this comic character has been created so that the masses of the world’s non-English native countries can laugh at it.
Johnny English, of course, is an insane secret agent who thinks of himself as a convincing in bizarre manner, so he reminds a bit of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who contributed to the performance of the main title of the firefighters at the opening of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character was originally based on a mysterious international traveler that Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV ad and left behind chaos everywhere.
There are two or two good moments in the latest Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English dressed in a medieval armor for a helicopter, and then the rotors got there for a few moments on his helmet.
Atkinson's comic vein is well applied in the film, but the movie humor doesn't really work, but it does not really work, even overwhelmingly, because today, franchises such as James Bond movies or Mission Impossible are boldly touched on the humor device.
To feel that the movie humor is more targeting children, and to me, Johnny English flickers, failed adventures do not reach the level of ideality and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the series of Mr. Bean.
The starting point of the film is eternal: the United Kingdom is in a serious danger.
A cybercrimer broke into the super secret online network of the British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the biggest fear of the agent Kevin Eldon, who, unfortunately, had only such a small role in the film.
This may be the last angle to the coffin of a self-determined and shared prime minister whose political popularity is in ruins: Emma Thompson practically shapes Theresa May and brings everything out of the poorly written character.
The intelligence advisors suggest that, since the presence of all the active agents has been revealed, you need to put a calm agent on the job.
This calm agent, of course, is nothing more than the two-sided Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher since his retreat, but he teaches children to spy – of course, there are funny scenes, while English describes the basis of spying in the “Rocksuli” way.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he meets with his former, suffering gun carrier Bough, who is now being shaped by Ben Miller.
Bough has been married and married to a submarine captain, whose mouth is always in the ear – Captain Vicki Pepperdine, who has a much better role than that.
Thus, his Majesty’s dual “Batman and Robin” pair of his national security service is reintroducing and confronting Ophelia Bulletov, the woman of the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as a true destiny.
At the same time, the prime minister is increasingly embraced by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to solve the digital problems of the UK: his name is Jason Volta and Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their clown mission: they start to burn a barbecue French restaurant and then smuggle themselves to Volta luxusjacht, and English actually frees the hell when you try to get to know Volta’s apartment using a VR-head.
These stations are needed to get to the final development, but they have been able to make a little too much impression on any fun and turn, perhaps too much a child movie.
The result is quite medieval.
As with the other Johnny English movies, I have the question: could the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a talent-worthy role?
The British Labour Party denies to introduce a four-day work week while paying the British five-day wages
Jeremy Corbyn's working party is working on a radical draft: a four-day work week, working for five-day wages.
The party is alleged to want workers to benefit from the revolution of artificial intelligence (MI) by providing employees with an extra free time due to increased revenue.
On the basis of the draft, workers would have a three-day weekend while taking them home the same as before.
According to the sources, the idea would be “appropriate” to the party’s economic programme, which aims to put the balance language on the side of the workers in the country.
The Congress of Professional Organizations also supports the idea of a four-day working week, so that workers can profit from the changing economy.
One of the head officials of the Labour Party said to Sunday Times: “The policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
Although it won’t happen from one day to another, the four-day working week is an idea that fits well into the party’s programme that would put his balance in the economy towards workers, it also includes a comprehensive industrial strategy of the party.”
It would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party has already campaigned in the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of four-day working weeks.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Work Party as a whole.
The spokesman of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not one of the policies supported by the Party, and the question is not yet on the agenda.”
Mr John McDonnell, Minister for Shadow Finance, presented his vision of the Socialist Revolution on the Economy at the last week's Labour Party Conference.
McDonnell said he was willing to fight to get the power back from the “nothing directors” and the “residents of the troops”.
If the plans of the shadow-finance minister were realised, the shareholders of the water-sharing companies would not receive the full profits they receive, while a labour-party government would use “deductions” as a punishment of the harmful activities considered.
McDonnell also confirmed that it plans to make employees a member of the Board of Directors and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds that would convert 10% of private sector shares to employees who could thus obtain 500 important dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy in the 60 Minutes show whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh can change their opinion
As a result of the FBI investigation launched against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, at least a week later, the final vote on Kavanaugh's electoral choice will be held. Question whether the result of the investigation can prove the Republican representatives so much that they don't support Kavanaugh.
In his "60 Minutes" Sunday interview, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something to think about.
Kennedy was less engaged than his colleague in South Carolina.
“I understand, of course,” Kennedy said.
I said that before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called to explode the case after the charges appeared, and I asked, “Do you?”
His answer was strong and clear.”
But Graham's vote seems to be concrete-proof.
“I have already decided about Brett Kavanaugh, and I need extremely serious accusations to change my mind,” Graham said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett has strongly denied the claims," he added to Graham, Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people named Dr. Ford confirmed the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new will turn out.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and have you managed to mitigate poverty?
On Saturday, the music event organized every year in New York, the Global Citizen Festival. World Stars in the festival are set up to stand for a really noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The global citizen will be hosted seventh times, expected to spend over tens of thousands of Central Park’s Great Passies, where participants can not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: to eliminate deep poverty by 2030.
The global civil festival was first organised in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is operated by an international interest group with the aim of eliminating poverty by bringing more and more people into the active fight against poverty.
They can receive a free ticket to the concert (if they are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket) who are committed to performing certain tasks or “actions”, such as taking voluntary work, sending e-mail to a leading politician, a telephone call, or any other worthwhile activity to draw attention to the project's purpose: to eradicate poverty.
But how successful has the global citizen been in the last 12 years in achieving the targets?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with concerts in order to convince others about the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called "clictivism" when people feel that they have contributed to a case by signing an online petition or writing a Twitter message?
Since 2011, more than 19 million “measures” have been carried out by the supporters of the project, which have served a number of different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to separating $37 billion from world leaders to policies and commitments against poverty, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and notifications that they were from their actions, they already paid $10 billion or collected during the collection of donations.
The group estimates that the money collected was directly affected by nearly 649 million people.
The Power of Nutrition is one of the main commitments, which is a partnership between the United Kingdom’s headquarters, investors and exporters, which aims to “to help children reach their potential.” The organization promised $35 million to help Ruanda eliminate hunger after receiving over 4700 Twitter messages from “global citizens”.
With the support of the United Kingdom government and donors, national governments and similar global citizens, we can deport social injustices and sub-foodness into the footnotes of the history books," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of Power of Nutrition, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also argues that after asking the United Kingdom to improve the food of mothers and their children in more than 5000 actions, the government has allocated resources for the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the food of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently published questions on the website of the Global Citizen is: “Why do they think that deep poverty can be eliminated?”
According to the Global Citizen’s answer: “It will be a long and difficult way that we sometimes fail and sometimes fail.
But like previous civil and anti-segregation movements, we achieve our goal, because we are stronger together.”
Among other things, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be performing at this year's New York event, and the directors will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister of Interior: the United States would apply a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports
“If necessary,” Washington would put the Navy on the market against the Russian energy carriers, for example, the Middle East would not be able to reach the Russian energy,” Ryan Zinke quoted Washington Examiner, an American Minister of Interior.
Zinke argues that Russia’s active Syrian presence, especially with regard to Russian operations carried out at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is only an excuse to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they are only in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe,” Zinke said.
And the Minister of the Interior says there are ways to prevent Russians.
“The United States can ensure that the sea routes are open and that they can be blocked if necessary, so that the Russian energy cannot enter markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke gave his words to the participants of the non-profit event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – the non-profit group defines itself as the voice of “energy consumers” in the United States.
In his talk, Washington compared his action against Russia and Iran and noted that it was practically the same method.
"Iran and Russia can be punished economically in the same way: using existing energy carriers and introducing new ones," Zinke said, while calling Russia as a "one-dimensional economy", pointing out the country's dependence on fossil energy carriers.
The statements coincided with the Trump Government's plan to export drop-in gas to Europe, stretching Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, Trump’s head officials, including the President, convincing Germany to disrupt the “placeless” wire project called the North Stream 2, which, if it is done, will make Moscow a “secure” Germany.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the existing capacity is doubled, thus increasing to 110 billion cubic meters of North Stream 2 wires only in an economic nature.
According to Kreml, Washington’s economic considerations oppose the project so strongly, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
"I assume that we are in the same position that energy should not be used for pressure exercises and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers freely," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a September, Moscow Energy Minister Rick Perry.
The attempt to convince the Americans went backwards, as Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industry Association (BDI), called on the United States not to intervene in the EU energy policy, as it would keep itself away from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I think it’s a problem when a third state interferes with our energy issues,” said Dieter Kempf, German Industry Association (BDI) President Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putyin after his last meeting.
Senator Elizabeth Warren massachusetts “please seriously” to start for the Presidency in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren massachusettsi said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections, he was “thinkly considering it” to go to the Presidency.
Warren Massachusetts, at a city meeting in Saintoke, confirmed that he was considering his departure.
“It’s time for women to enter Washington and put the poor government in place, and it’s time for a woman to be president,” Warren said.
After November 6, I will consider it seriously to go to the Presidency."
At the city meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said that he “will take the country in a bad direction.”
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren expressly criticized Trump and Brett Kavanaugh's highest candidate.
In a Friday Twitter message, Warren said, “Of course, it is necessary to investigate the FBI before the vote.”
However, according to a survey published on Thursday, the majority of the voters in Warren massachusetts do not think Warren should start with the presidency in 2020.
According to the Survey of the University of Suffolki Political Analysis Center and Boston Globe, 58% of the voters who voted for Warren’s “good chance” say that the Senator should not go for the Presidency until
32% support Warren's presidential candidate.
According to the survey, the former Governor of Deval Patrick's candidate would be supported by most of the requested, 38% and 48% would oppose it.
With regard to the 2020 presidential election, the name of high-ranging democratic politicians, such as former Vice-President Joe Biden, or vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, was also emerged.
Based on the report of the Associated Press, Biden will decide whether to leave until January.
Sarah Palin Track Palin PTSD at Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after he joined in September
He was arrested for domestic violence on Monday night
“As my son goes through, through which he went home, I understand the other families who experience the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers return home,” Sarah Palin told the audience at the meeting of Donald Trump Oklahoma.
Palin's son called his arrest as an elephant in the room, and said that his son, like the other war veterans, “removed, he returned hardly, and constantly wondered whether he would take due respect for the service that his fellowship, pilots, and all other members of the army have done for the country.”
Track Palint was arrested in the Wasill in Alaska, accused of domestic violence against a woman.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the review of the new U.S. asylum policy in order to ensure that those who are fleeing from violence by bands or by family.
The 18 Member States, as well as Washington D.C., wrote an expert letter in Washington on Friday to support a asylum seeker who is in court, writes NBC News.
In August, Grace vs. Sessions, initiated against federal policy by the American Civil Rights Union, was not released.
According to the claimant woman, his partner and the sons of a violent criminal offence were assaulted, but on July 20, American officials rejected his asylum request.
The woman is being arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors of the countries supporting Grace, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, have been described as places where many asylum requests to the United States come from, as there is a constant problem in these countries by criminal violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy revoked a decision taken by the Committee on Immigrant Appeals (BIA) of 2014 on the appeal of migrants who did not have documents, under which they could file asylum applications for domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C.'s attorney General said in a Friday notice that the new policy “will ignore decades of state, federal and international law.”
“All asylum applications under federal law must be assessed in the context of the facts and circumstances in which they exist, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the expert letter.
The prosecutors also pointed out in the letter that immigration-refusing policy would harm the American economy, as immigrants would become more likely to be entrepreneurs and “extend the lowest levels of jobs”.
In June, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered asylum judges not to grant asylum rights to victims of domestic violence and crime.
“The asylum law is the one who leaves his country because of racial, religious reasons, national domesticity, debt to a specific social group, or because of a legitimate persecution or persecution,” Sessions said on 11 June when announced policy.
The right to asylum has not been found to solve the problem of people all over the world, every day, whether they are serious.
Descended rescue in Palu, the number of dead doubled, the rescues run a race with time
The situation of survivors is becoming more and more invisible.
“Everybody is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother while restoring a feverful son in one of the evacuation centers of Palu’s disaster.
The ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We barely have a drink."
Some people returned to their homes to save them out of the wet stuff that can be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals that have also been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake will not be able to deliver people.
Some of the injured people, including the broken spine and shoulder Dwi Haris, were transported to the Palui Military Hospital. The patients were provided outside the hospital building due to high-strength postures.
The man’s eyes filled with tears when he recalled the fifth floor hotel room, in which his wife and daughter stayed, shivered into the destructive shock.
“There was no time to escape.
I think I needed to be among the fallen walls – Haris said to the Associated Press, and then added that his family came to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, and then it turned out to be quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of propagantic ads in the country
The Chinese ambassador of the United States accused Beijing of spreading propagand in the U.S. press. This happened a week after an official Chinese newspaper released a four-sided ad in an American daily newspaper that highlighted the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade relations.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to an advertisement in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa’s biggest edition, while accused China to intervene in the US Congress elections on 6 November. China denies the accusation.
Trump is accused of attempting to intervene in American elections, some American officials who declare Reuters are a new stage in Washington China’s ever stronger action to put China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual that foreign governments promote trade with their country through advertisements, the trade war between Beijing and Washington is becoming more intense in order to impose new and new customs duties on each other’s import products.
According to American and Chinese experts, at the beginning of the trade war, the Chinese customs duty imposed as a response were aimed at exporters of countries in which Trump and the Republican Party are popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese ambassador of the United States and his former governor of Iowa for several cycles, said that Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses, because the state of Iowa exports significant quantities of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that “China still exerts our country with propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government exploits the American tradition of freedom of expression and press by spreading propagand in the advertisements placed in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“But if we go to a Beijing newspaper store, we can barely find critical articles. The Chinese press does not faithfully reflect the opinion of Chinese people on the growing growth prospects of the Chinese economy as the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.”
Branstad added that “one of China’s most famous newspapers was not willing to enter” his article, but he didn’t call it.
Elements say that Republicans can alienate women voters before mid-term elections with Kavanaugh
According to the equators, many highly qualified Republican politicians are taking Brett Kavanaugh's top judiciary to protect in the crossfire of sexual harassment accusations, especially in the mid-term elections.
The case caused strong emotions, and most Republicans publicly stated that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be recovered – says Grant Reeher, a politician at the University of Sirakúza, Maxwell School, in a Saturday article of The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts about the fact that the FBI investigation proposed by the Republican Senator Jeff Flake in the last moment will be sufficient to reassure the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – neither tomorrow nor November,” said a newspaper in Washington, D.C., said Karine Jean-Pierre, Chief Advisor of the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday.
According to Mic’s report on Friday morning, some protesters at the Senate corridor scanned “November is moving!” as the Republican Justice Committee, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s statement, decided not to revoke Kavanaugh’s nomination.
“It will jump to a fantastic degree of democratic enthusiasm and motivation,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“Some people say it’s already very high, and that’s true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the unsure women voters in the city and young people from the ages (18-29) who are not enthusiastic for the president, often do not vote."
The analysts have already assumed before Ford’s public confession, that he could hit the Republicans if they continued to stand by Brett Kavanaugh. Since then, Ford described in the statement, why he accused the Supreme Court candidate with sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party was wrong on an inclusive soil,” NBC News said earlier President Michael Steele, the Republican National Commission.
“This is not just the vote of the Commission and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is named, but also the way the Republicans handled the case and as they acted with Ford,” said Priorities, who helped the elections of Democrats, U.S. Director Guy Cecil.
However, it seems that the Americans have quite shared whether Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true. Kavanaugh is a little more believed than Ford.
According to YouGov’s new survey, 41% of respondents fully or more believed Ford’s testimony and 35% of respondents gave the same answer.
In addition, 38% of respondents believe that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied to her confession, while only 30% of Ford believed that.
As a result of Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the authenticity of Ford's claims, as is also written by another accuser of Kavanaugh, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford swore to the Senate Justice Committee a week ago that Kavanaugh was drunk at the age of 17.
According to Ramirez, the highest court candidate showed him his genital organ at a party in the 1980s when both were studying at Yale.
The inventor of the world network would launch a new internet to face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, starts with the aim of launching the competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is built on the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where I want to store your data and who can access each information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to “buy over the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said.
It's a historical moment."
With Solid technology, the application allows people to create their own "personal online library", namely POD.
This may include lists, work lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available at the same time.
In the personal online library, it is unique that the user can completely decide who can access your data.
The company calls this “enforcement of the right of self-regulation of persons over the data”.
John Bruce, Director-General of Inrupt, said that the company's task is to ensure resources, processes and adequate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers working in the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, world technology developers can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team do not ask “Facebook and Google to introduce the entire change technology that would set up business models from one day to the other.”
“We don’t ask for permission from them.”
In the post published on Saturday at Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt was “deploying commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the newly built network on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical University.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has participated in debates on the neutrality of the internet.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am inevitably optimistic about the next age of the world network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann was celebrated by the priest in the First World War of Victory
The only Victory cross was received by his home town of Anglican priest, celebrated 100 years after he executed his hero in the first world war.
Bernard Vann was honored and commanded by Colonel during the attack on Belleglise and Leacourt September 29, 1918.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him, so he never knew he deserved the highest punishment of British armed forces.
The memorial stone was covered by two his grandchildren at a Saturday celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire County.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “symbolical” that the memorial stone was given exactly 100 years after his grandpa’s advocacy.
According to the London Gazette, Bernard Vann respectable and alergeous, on September 29, 1918, led his flag through the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel "dense fog and heated gun and machine fire."
Later, he rushed into the archipelago, and he was “exclusive heroic” at the top of the flag, and then he was invaded by a campian armor, harming three of his members.
Bernard Vann, honorable and alezer, shot a German shooter on October 4, 1918, only one month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never get to what my grandfather did, and that taught me humility,” said Michael Vann of his grandfather.
After the adventure led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also coronated the memorial stone.
Michael Vann said he was honored to play a role in the celebration and added: “The victory of a true hero proves how many of them will express their respects later.”
The MMA fans have been refreshed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of receiving Peppa piglets
Imagine you've been in the middle of the night to see the exciting Bellator 206, so that the mediation is gone.
In the San José show there were 13 confrontations, of which six were broadcast live in the United Kingdom, channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were prepared to fight each other, the English viewers were not a little surprise instead of Peppa pig.
This was difficult for many who stayed up until the morning due to this confrontation.
Instead of the MMA game, one of the fans described it as “a sick joke” on Twitter.
According to the state regulation, this content cannot be transmitted by the channel at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s shows, Dave Schwartz, the Vice-President of Bellator’s Department for Communication and Marketing, said.
"Yes, it's Peppa, it's the pig's time."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, promised that in the future, they will revise the schedule of the show to take account of the United Kingdom viewers.
“I think we can solve this again,” Coker said.
However, since it is Sunday morning 6:00, until Sunday, which is already Monday, we can’t fix the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show was switched, there were lots of messages, and then most of them were not quite friendly.
First we thought we had a technical problem, so we tried to fix the mistake.
But it wasn't that, it was a legal problem.
But I promise that this will not happen next time.
Instead of six so far, there will be only five matches in the program – we really wanted to make it for the viewers, but we accounted for ourselves.
“It was a miserable situation.”
Desert Island Disc: Due to the sexual orientation of Tom Daley's minority complex
Tom Daley’s art jumping Olympics said he felt lower than everyone in his youth because of his sexual orientation, but he was motivated to succeed.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like him.”
In the Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, Lauren Laverne told the director of the show that he was willing to give others the rights of gay to “reason”.
He added that since he became a parent, the Olympics are much less interested.
The permanent broadcaster, Kirsty Young, was missing several months because of the disease.
In Laverne’s first show, Daley called him “boatbreaker” to say that as a young person, he felt less than anyone else, because “socially he was not accepted when someone loved boys and girls.”
He said: “To date, the feeling of lower order and differentiation is a feeling of perseverance and strength to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something” to not disappoint everyone when he was exposed to sexual orientation.
The double Olympic bronze jumper became a well-known representative of the LMBT community, and using its role in this year’s national community games in Australia, asked the world’s governments to decriminate homosexuality in the countries as many as possible.
He said that he spoke to the matter because he felt lucky that he could live his life openly, without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others hope.
The three-fold world champion said that “the situation was completely surprising” when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, who first met in 2013.
Daley and the Oscar award writer 20 years older married last year and said that age difference never meant a problem.
“If a man is going through such a lot in his youth,” he said, 14 years old, and his father died in cancer three years later, it is hard to find someone in his age class who had experienced extreme experiences similarly.
In June, the couple adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley. Daley's own statement suggests that it completely turned his attitude to the world.
“If you asked me this question last year, I would have said that the most important thing is to win gold coins,” he said.
But you know what I found out? There are more important things than my Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold coin is Robbie."
The name of the child was after Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years after diagnosing his brain tumour.
According to Daley's statement, his father did not want to accept that he would die, and one of the last questions was whether they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics since he wanted to sit in the first line.
“I was inappropriate to answer him that ‘father, you will no longer be there in the first line,’ he quoted.
“I was holding my hand when his breath stopped, but until that moment I couldn’t accept that my father was not injured,” he said.
The following year Daley attended the 2012 Olympic and acquired the bronze.
“I realized that this is what I dreamed of all my life: jumping to the Olympic Games in front of a home audience, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
The first song you chose was from here. The number of Heather Small Proud (Blessed) helped him a lot in the Olympic preparation, and until today he will be libabőrös if he hears it.
The Desert Island Disc begins on Sunday at 11:15 on the BBC Radio 4 show.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he went to Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson record can be set by taking part in the 47th cup game on the Ryder Coupon Sunday, but he must win back his form if he doesn’t want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson’s record plays 12 times in the two-year-old event, due to its performance in four balls and four matches, Jim Furyk’s team captain sent him to the bay.
Instead of winning five winners in large competitions, it would be at the center of events as often as when it had to fight for the victory of the United States, now, in one half of the day, the team is struggling with the other half of it and trying to correct the mistakes that weaken its game.
At the top of his career, he never belonged to the most accurate bats, so the 48-year-old player does not really lie on the narrow track of Le Golf National, where a high-fruit should pay a very high price for the wrong hits.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson is on Sunday, the 9th match faces the precisely playing Frenchsco Molinari English champions who won all four matches this week in the team of Tommy Fleetwood, the beginner.
If the Americans who start with four-point disadvantages before 12 individual matches are strong, then Mickelson's game can be crucial.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of the role he played in today’s development. He enraged my back, covered my back, and promised that he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
It's very confident.
It's one of the biggest ones, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and the last week.
I didn't mean to have two matches.
I planned more, but in the situation we decided that it was the best solution.
He wants to be on the track, just like everyone else."
With Mickelson's on Sunday, he's gonna throw Nick Faldo's record, who hasn't played more games yet.
With this, you can close a series of Ryder coupons, which is far from the player’s individual performance.
Mickelson 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven infinites, but Furyk pointed out that the presence of the veteran player is also unacceptable for the team.
“Vicces, sarcastic, spiritic, likes to joke with others, a great team member,” he explained.
“I think younger players also enjoyed the games they played against him, and it’s good to see it.
His presence goes beyond the strict-minded game.”
Thomas Bjørn, Captain of the European Team, is aware that they can easily lose their benefit.
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone has a significant advantage for the last day of the Ryder cup of individual games, he can easily turn his back on his luck.
The Danish player was first introduced in a 2011 valderrama game, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage against the Americans, and at the end they only managed to maintain a hair-driven advantage for the 141⁄2–131⁄2-proportionate victory.
“We always have to remind ourselves that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, yet we won only a haircut, and we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got it out,” Bjørn said after the winning of Class 5–3 in 2018, and yesterday, leading to 10–6 on the Le Golf National track.
“We can think of the races of the past years, and everyone can see that the game isn’t over yet.
You'll have to play with full power tomorrow.
So let's go and do everything you need to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have a goal that is to win this trophy and now we need to focus on it.
As I said before, I’m most interested in the 12 players of our team, but we need to look at the other side, who are historically among the world’s largest players.”
Bjørn added: “I would never be prophesied in such a situation.
Tomorrow is a different pasta.
Then everything depends on individual performances, which is completely different than the team game.
It's great to play in a couple when things go well, but when a person stands out individually, it turns out in every way what a golfer actually is.
This must be understood with players to bring the best tomorrow out of themselves on the track.
They have to break off their partner, who will also have to bring the best form."
In contrast to Bjørn, Jim Furyk, Captain of the opponent team, expressly trusts that his players perform better individually than in couples, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points from four.
According to Furyk, both sides of the last day's resurrections have already been experienced: in Brookline, he was a member of the winning team, and then he was on the loser's side after the brilliant performance of the European team's "medinah wonder" mentioned.
“I remember all the damn words,” she answered when she was asked because she encouraged the players before the last day in 1999, Captain Ben Crenshaw.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we’re going to be the best of a quick start in Brookline, as we saw in Medinah.
If one of the teams really recovers, it puts the opponent's players under huge pressure during the middle games.
Thus, we set up the order and created our players so that they could perform a real miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas got the job to stand up for the job, and Rory McIlroy plays against the first match, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, followed by the first half of the European team.
“I decided to be in addition to the order because I think that’s how the picture will come together from the beginning to the end,” Bjørn added to the individual position.
Again, the transfer of Germany’s latest warship has been postponed
The German Navy’s latest fregat in 2014 should have been put on service to replace the aging cold war warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, this will wait for you at least for the next year.
The new Baden-Württemberg-class fregats flagship, “Rheinland-Pfalz”, was postponed to the first half of 2019, quoted by the Die Zeit Weeklist.
According to the initial plans, the ship should have joined the Navy in 2014.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships to the location of the Bréma class ageing fregats.
We know that it will be equipped with a large-fire gun and a variety of aircraft and aquatic vehicles with missiles and disguise technology, including a signal-resistant device that reduces the radar, infrared and acoustic signs of the ship.
Another important feature is that you rarely need maintenance, which in practice means that these latest fregats can be placed away from the mother's sites for up to two years.
However, due to the continuation of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power on the overseas, would already be lost when they were finally set on service, noted by Die Zeit.
The F125 fregat was released last year when the German Navy officially rejected the vehicle's opening and sent it back to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
There was little information about the causes of returning, but the German media has more critical “software and hardware errors” that make the warship unused in a fight.
Software deficiencies are a very significant problem, as only 120 seafarers will be served on Baden-Württemberg warships, which are only half the crew of the old Brema class.
It was also revealed that the ship is extremely overweight, which deteriorates its performance and indispensable to enable the Navy to make further changes later.
The 7000 tons of Rheinland-Pfalz are allegedly twice as difficult as the ships of similar classes in the Second World War.
Apart from faulty parts, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), while the project is starting at EUR 2.2 billion.
In the light of the new fregats problems, it is particularly important that Germany’s maritime presence is in need of warnings.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the National Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recently acknowledged that the Navy “will start to run out of the military ships of the available status”.
According to the public official, the problem has become an arbitrary process in the meantime, since the old ships had to be installed, but there are no more ships to replace the droppers.
He expressed concern about the fact that none of the Baden-Württemberg class fregats could join the Navy bond.
National Trust is searching for the secret lives of bats
A new research is carried out on a Scottish-People estate, which aims to find out how bats are used during hunting.
Researchers hope that the results can obtain new information on the behaviour of unique aircraft mammals, which can also benefit from subsequent species protection initiatives.
The National Trust for Scotland scientists will examine the behavior of ordinary and sopranic fractures as well as brown long gloves and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
In the appropriate points of the area, special equipment is placed to record the activities of bats during the year.
NHS's employees and volunteers will make mobile data collections with manual detectors.
Detailed analysis of the sound material of recordings can determine the frequency of battalion sounds and what the species is doing.
Researchers will also prepare a habitat map and report to specify in detail how animal behavior develops depending on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will show which are the most important habitats for bats, and which species will use them.
This information will help to determine the charitable effects of habitat management works, such as the development of gaps, and how to best preserve forest areas for bats and other species affected.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of bat populations decreased significantly over the past century.
Construction and development works disrupt the sleeping areas of animals and reduce their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, as is the case with the installed flame papers, certain chemical procedures used for construction materials, as well as the attacks of domestic cats.
The bats are not completely blind.
However, because of their predators during the nights, they rely much more on their hearings when they hunt for a pedestrian, nothing to see.
They can determine the exact situation of insects and landmarks based on their refined techniques based on the reversal of ultrasonic sound.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings across the country, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land, takes the question of bats very seriously.
They work with ten skilled professionals who regularly prepare studies and sleeping studies and sometimes participate in rescue works.
The organization created the first and only dedicated bats reserve for Scotland on Threave Births in Dumfries and Galloway, which gives eight homes from the ten bats of Scotland.
According to David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“In Threave, there is a great place for bats,” he said.
There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is necessary for a good lifespace.
But we don’t know much about bats, and thanks to the work done here and other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel great.”
He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that bats live there before renovating the buildings, as the destruction of a single facility could result in the destruction of 400 females and young individuals, which could lead to the death of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals, their destruction, their harassment and their habitat are prohibited by the law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, also asked for the help of the population.
He said: “We always have a lot of things we don’t know about bats, and we don’t have almost any information on the situation of most domestic populations.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges, his lawyers are indicting German magazines.
Cristiano Ronaldo was describing the accusations of sexual violence against him. He believes that others want to use their name to “introduce them to public knowledge”.
Football attorneys are ready to sue the German Weeklist Der Spiegel.
The Portuguese member and Juventus battler were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid him $375,000 to listen to the case, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo told a 142 million fan camp in Instagram Live that the news was “religious.”
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
What has been brought up today is all a lie,” he told the camera the five-fold gold ball player.
“They want to use my name to get into public knowledge.
It happens like this.
They want to become famous with my name, this is the life of the public.
I am a happy man, and my life is fine,” the player added in the presence of a smile.
Because of the claims called “unacceptable, infringing private life,” Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, writes Reuters.
According to Christian Schertz’s lawyer, the player will submit a claim for compensation for “the cause of moral damage to the extent that the seriousness of the infringement is sufficient, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The case was allegedly held in June 2009 in one of the Palms Hotels and Casinos in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went up to the athlete suite, where the man anally raped a woman, he is in documents submitted to the Nevada Clark County prosecutor.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident, and said to him that he was “99 percent good boy”, with the exception of “one percent”.
On the basis of the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo acknowledged that she had sexual relations with the woman, but he believed that all of this happened with a common consent.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and made a visit in a hospital about his injuries, but later he entered an outside trial, because he was “a fear of retaliation” and “reasonable humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman would now want to repeal the agreement as the trauma caused by the case continues to deteriorate her life.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo was just standing before a reconciliation (from Real Madrid to the Manchester United team) and this summer the Italian giant, Juve, bought the player for €100 million.
Brexit: the UK will “behave forever” the loss of car companies
The UK will “be treated forever” if he loses his world leader’s position after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Business.
He added that Toyota UK considers it “a worrying” to the statement to BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without agreement, then the car factory will be forced to temporarily stop production at the burnastonia factory near Derby.
“There is a need for an agreement,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese automaker company, in the case of Brexit without an agreement, jobs can be lost due to the delays made by the borders.
The toyota Auris and Avensis factory unit manufactured 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I see that if the United Kingdom falls out of the EU at the end of March, there will be production drops in the factory,” Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota Burastonia said.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) expressed concern about the possibility of leaving the EU without agreement on the operation of trade beyond the border.
For example, BMW stated that after a month of Brexit Miniket’s manufacturer’s Oxford plant is closed.
Car manufacturers are most concerned that in the case of Brexit without an agreement, there are risks in relation to the supplier chain.
Toyota’s production room is based on a “precision time”, and the components come from suppliers operating in the UK and in other EU Member States at 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom enters the EU on 29 March without agreement, cross-border disturbances may lead to production delays and lack of parts.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store enough parts for more than one day in Derbyshire, so production should be discontinued.
Clark said that it was known as Theresa May Chequers that the future relationships with the EU were “compiled precisely so that delay checks could be avoided at the border.”
“We have a need for an agreement. We want an agreement under the best possible conditions to enjoy not only the fruits of our current successes, but also the new opportunities,” BBC Radio 4 Today said.
Not only toyota, but also other manufacturers, can confirm that we need to keep our currently highly successful supplier chain."
Toyota couldn’t tell us how long the production would last, but warned that the cost of the accumulated could deteriorate the competitiveness of the factory in the long run, which would ultimately lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked 24 years in the burnastonia plant and currently active in the representation of Unite’s trade union, trade union members are increasingly concerned: “In my habits, we will never be able to get back jobs at this time.”
One of the government speakers said: “We have developed a precision and feasible plan for future EU relations.”
You can postpone Trump and Rosenstein's meeting again, said the White House
"You can postpone another week", Vice-President Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump's large-scale meeting, as the highest candidate of Brett Kavanaugh continues to discuss, and the White House announced in Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises Robert Mueller's special prosecutor's work, who investigates the Russian influence on elections, the relationships that may exist between Trump's advisors and the Russian government and the potential obstacles to Trump's judicial service.
In Washington, they have been wondering if Trump will eventually save the Deputy Prosecutor, thereby endangering Mueller's independence.
According to New York Times this month's report, Rosenstein considered coming to the meeting on a bundle to record the discussion with the president, and the question was whether Trump could be replaced on the basis of the 25th constitutional amendment.
Rosenstein denyed the speakers.
He visited the White House last Monday, and the talk was about submitting his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who had been present before the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would “no pleasure” to escape Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed not to confront the Senate Justice Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women suspected of sexual sins, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the final Senate vote.
Trump's press secret, Sarah Sanders, visited the Fox News Sunday show.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, the answer was: “We don’t have a designated date yet, even this week, but in the light of the case in the Supreme Court, I see another one week postponing.
It will soon turn out, and as always, I will inform the press."
However, some journalists doubtfully received this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked about this as well.
Sanders said that it was not the reason for the opposition of the rareity of press conferences to the behavior of television journalists as a “sensoring shark”, but he added, “I’m not denying the fact that they’re really sensational.
He then pointed out that direct meetings between Trump and the press would be more frequent.
“The President gives more questions and answers to interviews than any previous president,” he added, even without supporting the claim, “We looked at the numbers.”
“If the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, light years are better than to speak to me.
We are often trying to fence this line, and in the last few weeks there have been many of these occasions, so they can personally speak to the President of the United States instead of the White Home Press Conferences."
Trump regularly responds to the reporters’ questions when he leaves the White House or attends public events, possibly press conferences with the here-looking dignity.
However, the press conferences held alone are rare.
Why, it may be possible to conclude that this week, when the president produced a bizarre role in New York, and as a place, before the journalists gathered.
The head of the health wallet contacted NHS Scotland for EU employees due to Brexit concerns
The head of the health wallet stated in a letter that the country was grateful to the employees of the NHS in Scotland from the countries of the European Union and pointed out that he would hope to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was expected to leave.
The Scottish government has already agreed to cover the costs related to the claims of EU citizens in decentralised public service.
Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations on exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued, which are expected to make a decision in autumn.
The UK government also took part in preparing an unconventional scenario.
I know how an alarming period this can be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of which country they come from.
Workers from different EU Member States and other countries will help with valuable experience and expertise the work of a health wallet that has a positive impact on patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is your home as well, and we really want them to stay with us.”
Christion Abercrombie was under surgery after his head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebackeren, Christion Abercrombie, had been under an emergency surgery since Saturday, in a fight against the Vanderbilt Commodores team with 31-27 defeat, reported Mike Organ Tennessee.
Tennessee State's executive coach, Rod Reed, said to journalists that the injury occurred shortly before mid-term.
“He walked to the coastline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
The training team and the health personnel first gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the track, then put it on the coup and took it to further investigations.
One of Tennessee State's experts at Nashville in tennessee told Chris Harris, WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was beyond the operation carried out at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “he cannot yet know more about the type and extent of the injury,” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old student rested for one year, spends the first season in the Tennessee State team to which Illinois has been certified.
On Saturday, he presented five successful installations before he left the track, so he was already at 18 in the season.
Foreign customers will have to pay a higher fee after the property purchased in the United Kingdom
On the basis of the new plan, foreign customers will have to pay higher fees after buying properties in the United Kingdom, and they would support homeless people with additional income.
This would neutralize the success of Corbyn in young voters
The increase of the fee is aimed at those who are not taxed in the United Kingdom.
According to the State Treasury, this would represent 120 million pounds of revenue on an annual basis, which would be used to support homeless people
Foreign customers will have to pay a higher fee after the property purchased in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenue influential will be used to support homeless customers and will be prepared to announce Theresa May at a press conference today.
The aim of the step is probably to redress the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn in the young voters, which has been achieved by making a promise of more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase of the fee affects individuals and companies who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, and that additional income will be used to combat homelessness.
The additional fee added to the current fee, which may be charged over the higher fee for the second apartments two years ago and for the property purchased for the expense purposes, could be equal to three percent.
The State Treasury counts on revenue of EUR 120 million per year after the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are purchased by non-UK citizens, causing significant price increases, which makes the situation of the first residents becoming increasingly difficult.
Many of the rich regions of the country have become “spiritary cities”, especially in the capital, since many foreign customers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the fees that could help young people preparing to wait for their first home.
He considers that large construction companies are responsible for the high maintenance of real estate prices, which have become the habit of purchasing and leaving the areas on parlag. He asked May to delete quotas imposed on affordable houses and to start something with the “a disgrace of the residential market”.
Corbyn presented remarkable proposals for housing reforms, including housing control and the elimination of unreasonable dismantlings.
It would also provide more powers and opportunities for councils to build new houses.
May said: “I have said that I would like to devote my Prime Minister to the restoration of the English dream and to make life more and more better for every generation.
The real estate market situation needs to be resolved.
Britain continues, as always, open to those who want to live here, work and build a family.
However, it is not right that private individuals living outside the country as well as companies of foreign interest can buy real estates as easily as hard-working English citizens.
Dreams from their own home have become almost impossible for many, and the unworthy state of homelessness has become too accessible.”
Jack Ross: “I want to be the leader of the Scottish team.”
Jack Ross, coach of Sunderland, says that “the most important desire” is to be the leader of the Scottish national team once.
The 42-year-old Scot Coach would like to face the challenges of revival of the North-East Club, which is currently in the third place of the first class liga, leaving only three points behind the first position.
He then crossed his headquarters to Stadium of Light after he successfully returned St. Mirren's team to the first class football championship in the previous season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
Unfortunately, I was only able to get into the reserves – Ross said in his BBC Sportsound show.
When I was a child, I watched a lot of Scots in Hampden with my father and something always pulled back to them.
But now I only have the chance to succeed as a club manager.”
At Sunderland's executive position, there are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not concerned about the fact that he has to enter the prints of such big names and has previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
“I’m going to measure success in this moment to get the team back to the first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly the place of the first class in the league,” he said.
It will not be easy to get back, but more than likely, I will only consider my work here as a success if I can get the club back."
Ross's career in manager began only three years ago after he worked as a coach at the Dumbarton team for a while and spent 15 months at the Hearts coach.
Then Aolla helped to get back after the team fell back to the third class, and St. Mirren and St. Mirren at the end of the fall and got the title of the championship in the next season.
Ross says he feels much more confident now than he has ever been playing in his career, either in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academical team.
“It was a real decisive moment,” he recalled the time spent as the coach of Alloa.
I clearly thought that management was more for me than to be a player.
That sounds strange because I did well, and I had a lot of memories about it, and even a few moments of my life.
But the lives of players are sometimes very hard.
There's a lot to go through every blessed week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the job with stress and pressure, but the management tasks lie to me.
“I’ve always been interested in managing, and now that I tasted it, I feel the best in my skin all my adulthood.”
The full interview will be broadcast on the Radio Scotland channel from 12:00 to 13:00 on Sunday, September 30th.
According to a study, the beer falls best on Saturday afternoon at 5:30 p.m.
In the summer heat wave, the traffic of the English pubs in difficult situations has increased significantly, but the restaurant chains are still under pressure.
Based on the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, however, the restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The CGA business advisor, Peter Martin, who compiled the statistics, said: “As a result of the longer world championship role of the suntime and England, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when the pubs experienced a 2.8% increase in revenue, with the difference that the restaurants could have seen even greater decline.
In June, the reduction in the revenue of the restaurants increased by 1.8% in July.
Mostly, pubs and bars who betrayed alcohol have accomplished the best, who even produced more growth than the loss of restaurants.
The pubs that offer food also had an unpleasant impact on the long sunshine, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
It seems people prefer to drink at this time.
The revenue from pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month and the revenue from foods fell by 3%.”
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst for leisure and hospitality, says: “These results follow the trend that has been drawn since the end of April.
Weather, as well as major social and sport events, continue to be the main income factor in the entertainment and hospitality industry.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains are in a difficult position, and the annual revenue reduction of 4.8% may become particularly painful due to continuous cost pressure.
It could not have been worse in the long, hot summer for restaurant operators, and it will only take time to see if the lighter weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area.”
The total increase in revenue of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7% in July, which also reflects the slowing rate of introducing new brands.

Of five children have social media accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, there are five children (whether they are 11 years old) with social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a study conducted by a 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta Websites” is increasing.
The fear of sharing sexual content increases after the news
20% of students replied that they have a “major” account that their parents can see
From five, a child creates (up to 11 years old) a social media account that he hides from adults.
According to a study conducted by a 20,000 high school students, the number of Insta accounts is rapidly increasing, with which Instagram is referred to a photo-sharing page.
The fear of sharing sexual content is increased after the news.
20% of students replied that they have an incomplete “head” account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally encountered a secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teen profile on which she stood to “rabble me.”
According to the study conducted by Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), 40% of the 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% have private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them,” said HMC’s leader Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "sporters' voice" in the Scotland Athletic Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected not to be an executive director of the Skót Athletic Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle Scotland’s most effective attitude and the President of the Board, Ian Beattie, said that sports decision-makers will be an invaluable help for the extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
“Eilidh is a huge respect for Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community, and his presence will help the development of Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I was happy to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can really help the work of Scotland sports leaders.”
Two of the American athletes who regularly announced at BBC’s four Olympic gold coins were forced into a wheelchair at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics at 200 meters and 400 meters, but due to a temporary brain circulatory disorder.
He wrote on the Twitter page: “A month ago I got stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would be time for me to come back at all.
With a man-to-people job, but I've been fully recovered, I can walk again, now I'm going to agitation training.
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast Supplier Advertising Mothers to Coats Shares Online Society
A strong online debate was created by a company producing breast suckers, which compared breast-feeding mothers to headaches.
Elvie claimed that he developed “the world’s first quiet, portable chest absorber” and that their product was advertised in an ironic advertising that showed the freedom the device gives to the mothers who depressed their milk.
Four real mothers are dancing in a cowhouse full of a salvage, while in the background the songs of the following rows can be heard: “Yes, I have no dicks,” and “if they had not appeared, they are not twisted, but my boobs.”
And the refrene sounds like, "I'm pumping, pumping the child to eat big ones, pumping, pumping the girls."
Ad published on Facebook site was soon placed in the crossfire of online disputes.
The video reached 77,000 views and received hundreds of comments showing mixed bettings. Many people say the advertisement has been sparked from the "creams of the milk industry."
“To advertise the product with very tasteless cows.
Like us, their body produces milk only if they give life, but their calves are lost within days,” recalls one of them.
Elvie breast absorption can be positioned discretionly in a breast absorption (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment says: “Yes, it is terrible for the mother and the calf.
Why don't we use them to sell a chest sucker to mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else added, “Impossible ad.”
Others came to protect the advertising, a woman admitted that the video was “smooth funny.”
“I think the idea is genius.
I would have taken it straight if I were breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow too.
It's a foolish advertising, so I'm not even trying to see it anymore.
The product is brilliant," he wrote.
Another commenter said: “This is a funny ad in their workplace or in a toilet for mothers who are headed of their milk, who feel like “whole.”
It does not praise or judge the dairy.”
At the end of the video, women show that while dancing, their chest was a discreet chest sucker.
The campaign is about the feeling that women using breast suckers sometimes feel like cows.
Elvie Pump, however, is quiet, does not use wires and tubes, is discreetly placed in a breastpiece that allows women to move freely, hold their children in hand or even move out during breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, a co-owner and communication director, said: “The Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it was a bold, provocative advert.
We wanted to point out what challenges the use of breast suckers is and how funny it is to see how our chest sucker provides a sense of freedom."
Elvie's chest sucker wasn't the first time in the news.
The London Fashion Week was a two-child mother in Marta Jakubowski's clothes for the runner while using the product.
Hundreds of childhood migrants were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of child-age migrants in custody reached a record, while the number of monthly crossings has not changed much. This is partly explained by the fact that it is harder to find homes for them due to the harsh retoric of Trump administration and its actions.
Particularly, the recipients themselves are illegal immigrants, and they are afraid to ruin their chances of staying in the country if they apply for the adoption of children.
This threat grew further in June when it was announced that parents applying to the host and adults living with them in a household need to give fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, Head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Immigration and Customs Office), acknowledged in his statement last week before the Congress, that several dozens of people were arrested to receive unaccompanied minors.
The office later confirmed that 70% of the arrested were unpunished.
80% of the applicants and their households are illegally residing in the country, and a significant proportion of their criminals are convicted.
Therefore, we continue looking for such individuals," Albence said.
In order to accelerate the procedure for children, new rules have been introduced that part of them should appear to the court within one month of the arrest, instead of 60 days of the present time, and social workers will claim.
Many people enter the court through a video conference call instead of a personal appearance to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not provide legal protection, the immigrant will be rapidly removed.
In recent months, social workers and workers in the system have reported that the longer the arrest will take place, the more nervous and depressed children will be, and the chance of violent explosions or escape attempts will increase.
According to law enforcement, these risks are only increased by a larger facility similar to its tornilos, where the number of children makes it harder to filter those who need psychological care.
They added that if they don’t provide enough time to say goodbye to the children before they move them into such a facility, they’ll make them even more traumatic.
Syria called for immediate departure of the American, French and Turkish “invading forces”
Despite the 8th civil war in the country, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem, who spoke before the General Assembly of the United Nations, asked Syrian refugees to return to their country.
Moualem, the Deputy Prime Minister’s position, claimed that the foreign forces entered the Syrian territory, referring to the fight against terrorism, and “they will treat them as well.”
“You have to get out of here without any conditions,” the General Assembly said.
Moualem proved that “the war against terrorism will soon end” in Syria, where more than 360,000 have been lost since 2011 and millions of people have been forced to leave their home.
He pointed out that Damascus “continued his holy struggle to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and “the illegal foreign presence”.
The US's 2000 soldiers are staying in Syria, the majority of them as trainers and advisers help the Kurd forces and the Arab militias fighting Bassár el-Assad.
France sent over 1,000 soldiers to the country of war.
In relation to refugees, Moualem argued that the conditions for their return are appropriate and that only “one Western countries” are stirring “irrational fears” by alarming refugees from returning home.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help the return of the population,” he said.
Politics were made from a purely humanitarian question.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and its opposition on the closure of the war.
According to the UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a fight against the last great rebels around Idlib, can promote further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented Syrian government forces from launching a broad attack against the three-million populations.
At the same time, Moualem stressed that the agreement sets “light deadlines” and indicated its hope that military action would only be directed against the jihadists, including the An-Nus Front associated with Al-Kaida, which would be “released”.
The United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the Committee of the Representatives of the Government and the opposition can be summed up soon, with the task of preparing the Syrian constitution after the war and preparing the elections.
Among the conditions of Moualem, the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, for example, only "revision of certain articles of the present Constitution" is acceptable and protects all external actors from interference in the process.
That's why they're going to re-elect Trump
Following this logic, Trump will certainly be re-elected in 2020 unless there are a number of liberal viewers’ hopes, and before a scandal, he will not end his presidency.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic presidential final of all times.”
At the same time, the viewers enjoy the show.
Since 2014, the CNN’s main television vision has increased to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its views to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen’s data, Fox News attracts on average 2.4 million audiences in the main show time instead of 1.7 million years ago, and the “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC is the most viewed cable-speaking show with its 3.5 million audiences, which will be achieved on the evenings of the major news.
“It attracts us as fire, because something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the leading producer of the drama series of ABC “A designated survivor”. In this series, the cabinet is sitting in the chair of the president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell's veteran craftsman, "Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", believes it differently.
This is how a Boston taxi before the 2016 election:
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
“Why,” she asked Scovell.
“Because he laughed,” the driver replied.
This is the fun of chaos.
In contrast to the TV series, the stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe vs. Wade Precedens to reintegrate immigrant families and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very narrow layer can do not care about these facts.
However, it is no longer part of the responsible information when we have been staring at a debate program in which the author of the anonymous background talks used in Bob Woodward’s book “Feel” or Paul Manafort’s 15 thousand dollars of struccbőr’s jacket (“The Body’s dress” according to the wording of The Washington Post), or the consequences of the description of Stormy Daniels Trump, uhm, anonymous.
As for me, this will always come to mind about Super Mario from now on.
“A little feels like watching a reality show, where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, director of the ‘Zalog Stars’. At Trump, players are constantly changing and new turns are coming every day (such as N.F.L., begins to praise Kim Dzsongunt).
If you miss one part, you'll miss it immediately.
When I reached Fleiss this week, a pleasant, 26-degree, sunshine time, Kauain, he whipped the MSNBC in his house while recording the CNN show.
He couldn’t break away from the TV as Brett Kavanaugh began hearing in the Senate Justice Committee, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was.
“I remember when we made those crazy shows, many said that this was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss quoted.
I thought they were just kidding, but they seem to be right."

Both parties will make money to the most frequent competitions in the mid-term congress.
No one was surprised that in the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania, both parties spend their money countlessly after the two active representatives fought for the same chair after recasting the Congress Districts.
The newly re-designed Pittsburghi pre-City competitors are one of the democrat Conor Lamb, who last spring received an interim election mandate.
Lamb’s opponent, currently representative of the former 12 electoral circle of Pennsylvania, of Republican Keith Rothfus, presents a significant overlap in the 17th district of today.
The map had to be rewritten after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania concluded in January that the former borders were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
In the fight against the 17th district, the two party-funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) have been almost bidling to each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name was known in Pennsylvania after he won a major interim election in the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, its seat was the Republicans, Donald Trump won the district with 20 accuracy.
Political experts say that democrats have a lot better chances of winning.
The United States' sanctions against El Salvador for China's support and then stopped the plan.
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama were on the Beijing side, which Washington barely responded to.
Donald Trump negotiated with President Juan Carlos Varela Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pulled out the Trump Organization's leadership team.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called back the heads of the U.S. orders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of their “near decision that they do not support Taiwan”, announced earlier by Heather Nauer, the spokesman of the Ministry.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about 140 million dollars of US aid, including combating drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial support and targeted visa restrictions, were painfully affected by the Central American country, where the unemployment and murder rates were also extremely high.
As the final meetings continued, North and Central American competents postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year and the primary objective of reducing migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of administration made it clear that I would like to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
In the mid-October conference, Vice President Mike Pence also spoke, which, according to diplomats, is a clear indication of the importance that administration considers the event to be important.
The three American sents returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, and Washington did not give prosecutive statements and did not take criminal action.
John Bolton’s white homemade spokesman did not want to declare the details of the debate, which the three American officials, including two diplomats, reported anonymously.
They also supported external analysts close to administration, who were also willing to speak anonymously.
Historical experiences
The next strike may be Robert Mueller's special prosecutor's report, who examines whether Trump has interfered with justice in some way.
Mueller’s investigation also allegedly covers the cooperation of Trump’s team with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are put into majority in the Congress, they will certainly try to take Trump account of who may have to face the political judgement after the voters.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain questions, and Trump's failure is far from inevitable... just as it isn't the European principle-friendly.
We need to make serious decisions on both sides of the Atlantic – depending on how much the fight will take place.
In 1938, many German officers were willing to defeat Hitler, waiting for the West to stand next to the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
The support is missing, so it was not possible to prevent the bloodshed of the next few years.
It is at similar historical turnpoints that the inevitable development of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
In today’s America, we can identify several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, inspector of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been running since last year when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested to record the talks with the president and assumed that Trump's unsuitable office would be completed.
Rosenstein said The Times reported the events inaccurately.
“How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation launched against Brett Kavanaugh becomes absent or not complete, and despite a credible sexual harassment accusation, he is named a member of the Supreme Court?
And the most important question is that in the interim election we vote for a Congress that is ready to take Trump account of?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is facing a long winter.
I trust you won't, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovak, who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime, which once sat in my ambassador building.
My mother survived the holocaust, emigrated to America and asked 60 years later to burn candles on a table with a swastic sign during Sabbath.
How can I be a pessimistic about our future with such a cultural heritage?”

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is confident before the Rapid Vienna game
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. The victory against Austrias can ensure their participation in the Group of Europe-Liga G after the unwanted insolvency against Spain’s Villarreal.
Graham Dorrans’ knee injuries did not have a chance to go to the 2-2 game against Villarreal in the season, but it feels that Rangers could also set more bold goals on this result.
“It was a great team against Villarreal,” said 31-year-old player.
We believed we were able to get a point and have brought a point.
Maybe at the end of the day we could have pulled a goal, but we can't complain about the indefinite.
In the first half, they were better and we switched to it in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy because they were good enough on their previous game, but our sponsors will certainly be able to win behind our backs.
Last year was hard enough, I was injured, there was a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
Our team is good, the guys enjoy the game, the exercises are good.
I hope that if we add everything, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results.”
Many women are concerned about not saving enough for their age
The participants in the survey had accurate ideas about the age of care they wanted, but only a small part of them talked about it with their family members.
According to the Nationwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected costs of their old-age care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them responded to talking about this with their children.
“Everybody wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually raise the subject,” says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Business.
The following should be done.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and your children: You can’t expect them to take good care of you if you don’t tell in time what your needs are.
Together with your adviser and family, choose where and what care you want; these decisions have a significant impact on later costs.
Introduce a financial advisor: he may give useful ideas on how to pay the planned benefits.
Financing can be done with a traditional insurance bond designed for old-age care or a life insurance combined with a hybrid saving, which can cover expenses or use your own assets as a coverage... if you have enough resources to add.
Prepare legal documentation: This will prevent the possibility of later litigation.
Trust a representative, a trustworthy person who performs health issues on your behalf, supervises his medical care and ensures that everything happens according to his expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone with their finances as well.
This trustworthy person makes the necessary financial decisions and makes sure that you pay the bills when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget about the small details: Let’s assume that your old parent has been in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer your medicines and allergies questions?
Please record these data in writing so that they are available at any time.
“Not just financial issues, no matter who your doctor is,” Martin added.
“What medications do you take?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned in advance.”
A man was shot several times with air guns in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he went home after his evening program.
His 40-year-old victim was attacked on the part of the Ilfracombe Oxford Grove, in his chest, abdominal and hands.
According to the local time, the police wrote the shooting around 02:30 as an “anonymous act”.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and escapers in Indonesia
At least 384 of them lost their lives when a large earthquake on Friday, and then a runner broke down to the city of Indonesian Palu. According to the authorities, the number of victims could increase further.
The region’s communications network has also been damaged, so there has been no news from the Donggala government north of Palu, where it was the center of the 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
The capital of the Central Celebes Province of Palu, on the western coast of Celebes Island, was built at the end of a narrow Bay, the estimated population was 379 800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating the 40th anniversary of its founding, when the earthquake and the escaper were blown.
The Governance of Donggala is more than 300 km away from the northwest coast of the island of Celebes.
In 2017, the population of the governorship, less than 2,99,200 people, was around 200 people.
In Central Celebes, fishing and farming are particularly characteristic, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is one of the important sectors of the economy, but mainly in Morowali, on the overshore of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Control Agency, Palut and Donggala have suffered several times in the past 100 years.
A runner in 1938 completed more than 200 inhabitants and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996 western-Donggala got a runner, then nine died.
Indonesia is located in the area of the earthly active Pacific Fire Ring, which is why earthquakes are common.
Only a few of the major earthquakes and escape wings of the past years:
On December 26, 2004, a huge seaquake began on the western coast of the North Sudan Province of Aceh, which launched a refugee of 14 countries, with a total of 226,000 lives required along the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the victims lost their lives in Aceh.
2005: Strong ribbons shake the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
There were hundreds of deaths near Nias Island, Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-strong vibration shocked the southern part of the island of Jáva, the largest population in Indonesia, and the runner in the trail demanded almost 700 victims on the south coast.
2009: 7.6 earthquake was destroyed by Padang, near the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
They lost more than 1100 lives.
2010: A 7.5-strength shaken one of the islands of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, and brought up 10 metres of fountains, which destroyed dozens of villages and demanded about 300 lives.
2016: Surface vibration was the governor of Aceh Pidie Jaya. In many cases, panic and destruction emerged after it reminded many of the memories of the terrible escaper in 2004.
This time the escape price was not created, but more than 100 people died under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombs are a popular Indonesian island among tourists; a great vibration in this area demanded 500 lives, especially in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings have become equal to the earth, and thousands of tourists have been stuck on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, former Dutch governor Sarah Palin and vice-president's son, was arrested by the accusation of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old, lives in Wasill, Alaska, suspected that he had committed domestic violence, prevented domestic violence, and resisted arrest, announced the state police of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance wanted to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took her phone.
Palin is being arrested in the Mat-Su dental house, a $500 warranty for it, announced by the DPRK.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, and he answered his question of guilt, “Not guilty at all.”
Palin is accused of three A-class violations, i.e. with a maximum of four years of prison and a fine of $20,000.
In addition, they are accused of a B-class breach, which can lead to a one-day closure and a fine of $2000.
Palin is not the first to compete with the law.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently discussed by the Veterinary Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of preventing domestic violence and reporting of crime and also of holding weapons under alcoholic influence in connection with the case.
His girlfriend then claimed that the man hit him on his face.
Sarah Palint criticized several veterans in 2016 when his son’s behavior was attributed to posttraumatic stress from the Iraqi service.
Earthquake and escapers in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 they lost their lives after a Friday earthquake on the island of Celebes in Indonesia.
The 7.5 earthquake caused a refugee that destroyed thousands of residential houses.
Systems responsible for electricity supply and telecommunication have become ineffective, the number of dead will probably increase in the following days.
The center of the earthquake was close to Central Celebes, from the Indonesian capital to the northeast of Jakarta.
In social media, many videos appeared on the arrival of the escaper.
On the beach of Palu, hundreds of people gathered at a celebration, and then they ran the runner.
The federal prosecutors asked for a death penalty on the suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors are asking for a death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of eight terrorist attacks in New York City since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov, according to the accusation, drove a car hire from Home Depot to a bike on the street of Alsó-Manhattan West Side Highway, hit a lot of pedestrians and bikes.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov has killed eight victims “willfully” and that he was “willing” to cause injury, is in the submission of the prosecutor’s office of the southern district of New York.
According to the file submitted, any evidence of the two accusations may be justified by the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused of 22 crimes, including eight-year blackmail murders, which were used only to combat organised crime and to destroy and destroy motorised vehicles.
The attack was “demanded for significant planning and pre-reasoned intention”, claimed by the prosecutors, and according to their wording, Saipov carried out his actions in a “smart, cruel, inhuman” way.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” he said.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York last decade asked for a death penalty for an accused.
Khalid Barnest was sentenced to kill two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he eventually sentenced to life in prison.
In the Federal case of New York, a death sentence was taken in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple was sentenced two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg were completed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has not proved any repentance in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogation, he claimed he was happy to do what he did.
Saipov said he was watching ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea of the attack, standing in the prosecution.
According to the police, he asked me to put an ISIS storm in his hospital room.
In all 22 accusations, he declared himself innocent.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “understandably disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutors.
“We believe that the actual loss of freedom in life for confession would have been more favourable, the death penalty only extends the sufferings of all the actors involved in the matter,” says Patton.
Saipov's defendants have previously asked the prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
A member of Tory believes that NIGEL Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage, in his protest at the Tory Conference, stated that “he calls the army of the people into battle.”
According to Ukip's former leader, politicians should feel pressures for Eurosceptics after one of Theresa May's parties has stated that Farage should be trusted with EU negotiations.
The conservative Peter Bone, who did not complete any office, told the participants of the Birmingham meeting that the United Kingdom would have “resigned” a long time ago if Farage was Minister for Brexit.
It is well characterized by the pressure within the Mayre-highing party that Toryk of the remainder party was spoken in another protest against Brexit in the city.
May aims to implement the Chequers Plan, which calls for permanent lavish between Brexit and the Residual Party and the EU.
According to his allies, despite negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that the Eurosceptics and the Working Party can choose only from his package or “full chaos”.
Bone, in protesting Leave Means Leave, held in Solihull, said he had to count with the Chequers Alku.
He recommended that Farage be brought to the House of Lords and be entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had led the negotiations, we would have stepped out,” he said.
Wellingborough said, "I'm in favour of Brexit, but the Chequers agreement must be counted."
By criticizing the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight in the world wars to be servants of others.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the assumption that since the 2016 vote, the public voice changed: “There is no real reason for the British people to change their opinion and to stay.”
The Brexit-party Tory representative Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the meeting and said to journalists: “I just ask: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people’s voice.
The Chequers accompanies the public opinion, the opposition will not vote, the party is unfamiliar, and mostly among the activists who work on the ground and helped us reach government.
Forget about Chequers and listen to us."
He added to May as a corner message: “Only the prime minister can keep his chair, who keeps his word.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians should “sense pressure” so that they wouldn’t dare to betray the results of the 2016 referendum.
“The trust between us, i.e. the trust between our people and our politicians, is now the bet.”
They want to betray Brexit, and today we gathered to fire it, and we won't let them do it."
These words turned to the inspiring crowd: “I would like our politicians who are preparing to betray Brexit to feel pressure.
We will fight the army of the people to defeat Brexit, and we will not rest until we make the United Kingdom again an independent, proud country.”
At the same time, the remainder parties took part in Birmingham, and then held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A few activists founded the “Torys against Brexit” movement on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, the working party, lived on the conservatives for the purposes of the party, due to the security errors that occurred during the opening of the conference.
“These people said they had the IT background for a Canadian-Plus Plus agreement, a border crossing without any ground and a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders,” he added.
They're just talking to me.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he stressed.
Warren “wear carefully” to go to the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, he would carefully consider leaving for the Presidency.
According to Boston Globe’s report, the masschusetts democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at a forum in West Maschusett.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing for a re-election in November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehll, who was a co-chairman of Trump 2016's massachusets campaign.
For some time, the inventions have been made that maybe he could be the one who could replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was held in the 36th forum forum since the office of Trump with electorals.
A participant asked if he was planning to go to the presidential election.
Warren said that it was time for women to play a role in the restoration of the misplaced government in Washington, including the highest position.
They arrested the person suspected of shooting Sims in the LSU
On Saturday, Baton Rouge's police in London announced that he was arrested on Friday by the shooting suspected of a basketball player in LSU, Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge police station announced the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson arrest at the press conference held at 11 a.m. in the Eastern Coast.
They published a video of Friday shooting and asked for help in identifying the man on the recording.
The 20-year-old Simst, near the University of Southern, got the death shot on Friday early morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered head injury from the shooting that proved to be fatal,” said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, according to 247sports’ report.
Wayde's friend took care of him, and then Simpson shot him.
Simpson at the interrogation admitted he was standing on the spot, he had a gun, and he shot Wayde Sims.
The arrest of Simpson took place without an incident, the man was arrested at the East Baton Rouge County Police Office.
In Baton Rouge, he played 32 games in the last season, 10 as a beginner, on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 sets.
Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton got closer to the World Championship after gaining the victory before Sebastian Vet
After Valtteri Bottas qualifies himself better than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear immediately that Mercedes' team's instructions will play a big role on my race.
Bottas, who started from the pole position, began well and almost put Hamilton in trouble because the first defended his position in two circles, allowing them to attack his teammate.
He first stood in the box with Vet and let Hamilton be stuck on the market behind the middle field, which should have proven to be decisive.
Mercedes stood in a circle later, and came out behind Vet, but Hamilton was pre-existing after a close operation, during which Ferrari's pilot left the inner curtain free after he moved twice as a defense in the third cannabis.
Max Verstappen, celebrating the 21st birthday, began from the back of the drawers, and was the seventh at the end of the first round.
Then he led most of the race because he did not replace rubbers so that he could quickly reach the goal and prevent Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of the fourth place.
Finally, he stood in the 44th round, but the remaining eight were unable to increase his pace, so Räikköne became the fourth place.
“It was a good day because Valter worked fantasticly all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was ordered to let go.
The team achieved exceptional work to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
His speech was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting, as the Senator insisted that he did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, a new member of the Supreme Court for sexual harassment.
At the meeting in Western Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but noted that things in Senate prove that people are “faithful, hateful and liars.”
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the past few days in Senate when they see the anger when they see that people are angry, believing, hateful, and liars,” he said.
“If we look at the statements and leakages, they say, “Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document?”Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, let's just stop for a second.
We leaked?... no, we didn't leak," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent a letter about Kavanaugh in July to Feinstein, and the letter was leaked at the beginning of September. Feinstein denyed that the source of leakage would have been his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill’s report.
“He asked me to handle it confidentially, and I also treated it confidentially in accordance with his request.”
However, it seems that his denial was not accepted by the president who noted at the Saturday evening meeting: “I’ll tell you what the situation is: his body talk was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but that was the worst word I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women that the Democrats used alleged accusations for their own purposes.
“They are willing to get the power back with any means, but they will get the power back.
You can see religiousism, hatefulness, they don’t care about who they are being treated, who they need to take over to gain power and control,” said the President’s words by Mediaite.

Despite the fact that his colleagues survived their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old, refused to leave his post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, which was asked.
He stayed there so that Batik Air’s 6321 flight is already on the run.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
Later, he lost his life in the hospital.
The Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could save hundreds of lives, reported the case in Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Paloa.
“We needed our hearts when we heard the news,” he added.
At the time, the authorities are afraid that the number of deadly victims can be thousands, according to the country's disaster control organization, the city of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is difficult to approach.
“The number of victims is likely to increase further, because many were under the ruins, and many were unable to reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the organization.
The waves reaching six metres of height destroyed Palut, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft deliver help and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The ambulance cars will bring new bodies every minute.
There's little clean water.
"The stores were stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Indonesian leader of the International Red Cross, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
This is already a real tragedy, but it can be even worse.

Are you ready to report CNN?
Indonesia has been invaded this year by earthquakes on the island of Lombok, in which more than fifty-fifty died.
Micronesia flight misfortune: Air Niugini says a person has disappeared in flight misfortune in the lagoon
According to the latest report by the airline operating a flight in a quiet ocean lagoon in Micronesia, a person disappeared, although it was previously claimed that both 47 passengers and staff were successfully evacuated from the explosive airplane.
According to Air Niugini's press release, the Sunday afternoon situation indicates that a man cannot give a number of passengers.
According to the airline, he cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to any further information relating to the passenger, such as the age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and staff after landing at the Chuuk airport.
On Friday, officials reported seven people were transported to the hospital.
According to the airline, six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of misfortune and the exact course of events have not yet been cleared.
According to the airline and the US Navy, the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the landing station.
Some witnesses say the aircraft lost the landing track.
A American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was very low.
“This is a great thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that, along with others, the force in water was able to gase to the explosions of the sinking plane.
He said the air escorts panicked and shouted, and he suffered less headaches.
According to the U.S. Navy, shippers who repaired a ferry were also helped in the rescue, and shipped people to the beach with an explosive boat before the airplane flooded 30 metres below the water.

The analyst set up the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor described the accused man in the re-trial trial that he was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for hours as an expert in information analysis.
He knew with the jury how he put together the 29-year-old, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old, Jessica Chambers' movements at the night of the woman's death.
According to Rowlett, he received several phone locations based on the night of the woman’s death with Tellis Chambers, which contradicts the man’s previous claims, reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that your phone was close to Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford gave his witness on Saturday, in which he said that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis “were lying because I had my truck in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago at the time of the woman’s death.
According to mobile phone data, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the woman's text messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
“He erased him from his life,” Hale said.
Defense is planned to start a closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be before the jury that day.

Is it a black again?
New York's dada sued for dismissing a party after a "rasist" message
A New York woman brought an action against a couple because she was dismissed from discrimination after a misspelled message by her mother complained that they were able to apply “a black” dawn again.
The couple denys that they would be racists and that the trial would be similar to “treatment”.
The two-child mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment when the first day of the arrival of the new childcare, Giselle Maurice, saw that woman was black in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEM, MAY ONE ONE MAY!” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message for his husband.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after he woke up to his bacterial, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “unclinedly”, dismissed Ms. Maurice, claiming that the departing woman, who was afro-American, did a bad job and was more likely to be a philippine.
Ms. Maurice was paid a day's work and sent home with a Uber.
Maurice now charges the party for redemption and asks for 350 dollars a day for the inhabitable work of the six-day period, for which it was originally hired, even without a contract.
“I want to show them to stop the journey, and that’s not what they can do,” he said to Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to racism-prosecuting claims that the termination of Maurice was reasonable because they were afraid they could not trust him after they were offended.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t mean.
It's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone who was rude, even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn?
Come on."
According to Plasco, her wife was born only two months ago, and she was in a very difficult situation.
“Would someone attack you like that?
It’s not really nice to do that,” the investment banker added.
While the legal procedure is taking place, the court of public opinion has already quickly condemned the party in social media, harming their behavior and logic.
According to a letter just found, Paddington’s publisher was afraid that readers would not be able to connect to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the acceptance of the book, said of the letter: “There is a way to imagin ourselves, who first reads before his publication.
This information is quite fun now that we know how great the Paddington is.”
He said his father, who worked as a BBC operator, before he felt inspired to write a childbook about a little play mask, would not have been difficult if his work had been rejected, and then added that his 60th anniversary of the book was successful after his father’s death last year.
Paddington was called a very important member of his family and added that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he wasn’t at all imagined,” he said.
“But because Paddington was almost real for him, he was like a child who brings something to him: we are proud of him even if we really don’t deserve it.
I think Paddington's success was something like this.
Although he created it and made it out of his imagination, he always attributed it to himself as Paddington’s merit.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
When you landed with your daughter in Nizza, Louis Pasteur Hospital, where doctors struggled in vain for her life.
“He called to say that he was in a very bad condition and that he was not expected to survive,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I received a call from Nad, in which he told me that my daughter will die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
I said goodbye.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave him to continue to throw, slowly run out and then left his body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to be over.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, when she was mourning her daughter's loss, went into the plane with the others who didn't care about the attempt she had just gone through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I drove my head down, and all the time my tears were squeezed.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this all overexpensive sympathy for Nad.
That you need my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much."
Postcards with grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys built postcards full of inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a walesi bridge.
Ms. Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and then committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the same as I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that his son was a promising cook, and his charm was stuck to everyone.
“He knew all of his smiles.
He always said his smile throws up any place.”
But before he died, he gave up his work because he was “very bad.”
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, found his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, “I was very concerned that this would have a dominant effect.”
Ms. David made the postcards for the purpose, “so that people can find out some people can find and talk to them, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit quietly, you have to talk!”
Ms. Humphreys, who has lost Mrs. Davies' girlfriend Mark for years, who has been a partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her male mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depression, or anything,” he said.
“Some days before Christmas we noticed a change in your attitude.
He was under Christmas day: when the children opened their gifts, he did not look into their eyes and like them.”
He said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to process it: “He left a huge space in the family.
He broke our hearts into small pieces.
But we have to continue the fight."

Question Brett Kavanaugh's future as the FBI starts his investigation
“I thought that if he was able to achieve what he asked for – a limited-time, limited-scale investigation – we might be able to agree,” Mr. Flake said, adding that the Committee held it “from the fall of pieces” due to the insolvency of the party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose FBI investigation?
Their resistance can only be known for timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if it is expected that the Republicans do not perform well, it will be much more difficult for them to get their men into the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call Senators and lobby with them because of Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There is a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow the Vice President Mike Pence to take a decision to refer Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of dissidencies in North Korea under "low" Kim's control
The number of North Korean dissidents in South Korea has decreased since Kim Dzsongun was in power for seven years, a South Korean lawmakers said.
Park Bjengszok quoted the data of the Southern Ministry of Combination and said that in the last year it was 1127 dissidents against 2011 when this number was 2706.
Park said that the stronger border guard between North Korea and China and the higher punishments imposed on human smugglers were the main causes.
Phenjan did not comment on this information publicly.
Most of the northern dissidents eventually receive Southern Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them flee to China, which has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
The dissidents of China as illegal immigrants and are not hosted as refugees, and often send them back violently.
The relationship between the North and South in practice has improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenjan, at the center of their meeting, the closed nuclear dismantling negotiations.
This historic meeting came between President Donald Trump and President Kim Dzsongun in Singapore, where there was great agreement on further cooperation with the nuclear weapons-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Jongho blamed the US sanctions since the lack of progress.
“In the absence of trust in the Americans, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is unthinkable that we are unilaterally dismantling our weapons,” Ri said in his speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a hysterical, he said he was inappropriate to the Supreme Court.
The minority president of the House, Nancy Pelosi, appointed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, called "hysthematic" and claimed that his behavior did not correspond to the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin.
“I was unwillingly reminded that if a woman acted like that at any time, it would be called hysterical,” he explained Pelos’ reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Committee on Justice of the Thursday Senate.
Kavanaugh was against the celebrations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in their teenage age.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he shouted and his voice closed when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
In addition, he expressly condemned the democrats of the Committee, and the accusations against him were organised by “gretesk and coordinated character murders” because of the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election of the Hillary Clinton.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s behavior has proven that he is not suitable for the work of the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was dismissed against the Democrats.
“I think he has excluded himself from his statements and the behavior he has proved against Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi was hesitated when asked if he tried to take Kavanaugh account of it, in case it fills the post and if the Democrats acquire the majority in the parliamentary.
“I’m saying that if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, it’s not just for the Supreme Court, but not for the court where you are now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judicial position at the Capital Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions regarding the Reasonable Supply Law or Roe vs. Wade, as Kavanugh is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings of Kavanaugh, he avoided questions about whether the Supreme Court would reverse the decisions.
“There’s no time for a hysterical, biased person to be among the members of the court, and he expects us to break from joy,” Pelosi said.
And women have to hold their hands.
This is a legitimate explosion, a rage that has grown up for months and years, and it cannot be released without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it would be so rare, right?”
“I had a great help from a woman who worked in a leading position,” he continued. “He said to me that he was crying in anger, but he developed a technique, according to which he started crying in anger, he said to his partner: ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
But I'm mad.”
And then he continued.
And I thought it was a great idea."
Partly, they look at tears as a sign of anger because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the most vibrant memories of my early work, a office controlled by men, where I once started crying in my anger in the inability to get caught by an older woman at my neck - a cool manager I always feared - and took him to the stairs.
“You never let them cry,” he told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be pleased because they're upset.”
Patricia Schroeder, the then democratic congress representative of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an outside-married affair, Monkey Business fell out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, he found out that there was no reason he couldn’t go for the presidency itself.
“There wasn’t a well-thinked decision,” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the competition, and the new candidates wanted to be in the middle of their backs.
Someone named it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign has been held for a long time, Ms. Schroeder has missed the money collection, so he admitted that he would not compete unless he had picked up $2 million.
He was a defeat battle.
He found out that some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“They thought that I would receive a discount?” he wondered.
When he held a press conference that he did not launch an official campaign, the emotions were so dissolved for thanks to the people who supported him, and for the money collection and the system that made it difficult to reach voters directly, and for the anger of sexism, that his throat was gone.
“They thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder pointed out how the press reacted to it.
“It was believed that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my tombstone?
“Blessed”?”
How can the US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening of the trade war between the US and China was almost earringing, and the battle has not yet ended, and the break-up between the countries may be favourable for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warnings at the beginning of the year by taxing the most important Chinese export products, including solar elements, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week was due to the fact that the new duties have already affected a product worth $200 billion, taxing virtually half of the goods from China to the US.
In all cases, Beijing imposed a duty of between five and ten per cent on a US product worth $60 billion.
China has admitted that every time, the second largest economy in the world will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you'd like to take Washington to the backup, it would mean you'd have to give the backs before the demands, but public bending to the United States would be too embarrassing for Hszi Chin-ping, China's President.
However, experts say that if Beijing is well tactical, the US’s trade war pressure can be good for China in the long run, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in Washington, or Beijing, can create conditions that could push any of the economies of the two countries into economic charm is much more serious than the observers have previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, an Asian research assistant at the New American Security Branch.
Syria is “prepared” to return the refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready to return to the volunteers and ask for help in rebuilding the country destroyed over seven years in the war.
In his speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Valid Moallem claimed that the state of the country is getting better.
“The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the results achieved in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to escape between terrorism and self-powered economic measures, which affected their daily lives and their living.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have abandoned the country since the explosion of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said that the Syrian state would welcome all the help to rebuild the country.
However, he stressed that no conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising would be accepted.
Europe has acquired the Ryder cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder coupe 2018, defeating the U.S. team at 16.5:10.5 in proportion to Le Gold National outside Paris.
The U.S. has fallen in the European stage sixth time and has not won Ryder in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its title as the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn reached the 1.5 points necessary to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player who struggled on the whole tower, put his hit in the water at the par-3 16 holes, giving Francesco Molinari this victory.
The Italian golf player Molinari shines around all around, so he became one of the 4 players who has ever achieved 5-0-0 results since the gym started in the current form of 1979.
The U.S. Jordan Spieth was released by 5+4 of the lowest player in the European team, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2+1 against English Ian Poulter, who may have participated in the last Ryder coupe.
The eight Ryder cup veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose and believed in me.
I'm so happy I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is all about the team, and I am happy to help you," said Garcia, who won with emotions in Europe.
The Stafetabot is handed over to Jon Rahm, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2&1.
“I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this man,” said Rahm 23-year-old.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 careers in Ryder.
This is a strange statistics from one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 addresses, and who only Jack Nicklaus precedes.
The U.S. team struggled all weekends, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played a great golf during the whole gym.
After the disappointing result of the team captain Jim Furyk, he said, “He is proud of these guys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we burned Europe.
We fought.
Get down in front of Thomas.
Great Captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will work together with our team, the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lift the hats.
The opponent was better than us."
