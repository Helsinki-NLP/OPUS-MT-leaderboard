The Prague Stock Exchange has been reduced to the end of trade
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the morning crash.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Company (ČEZ) have reached nearly half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its fall from the beginning of Tuesday’s trade, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall of Wall Street shares is behind the decline.
This is how the market reacts to the result of the vote of the American Parliament, which rejected support for the stability plan of the financial sector there.
Falling shares in Asia
On the Asian Stock Exchange, the dramatic fall of shares was carried out on Tuesday, although the indicators during the day some of the losses were eventually erased.
The Hong Kong Sound Seng stock exchange index described almost four percent during the course of trade, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decrease to approximately 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, watching Chinese shares, fell by 3.8%, and the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but the losses eventually decreased to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan’s stock exchange fell by 3.6 per cent.
"The timing of the US rescue action is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, defines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American Lawyers should start the negotiations immediately, and they should accept the proposal for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens other countries to feel the consequences of this.
The Blood Bath of American Stocks
On Monday, the U.S. Parliament rejected the draft financial support system, to which 700 billion dollars (maximum 12 trillion crowns) should have been translated.
The lawmakers therefore ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush said the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, American shares had a blood bath and the leading stock index recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, and the same fall was last experienced in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not accepted in the Parliament, the index began to fall free.
Congress has retreated: US government can pump $700 billion into banks.
The main leaders of the United States Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on the agreement in the broader form and financial assistance to the US financial system.
They will vote on this in the beginning of the next week.
The American lawmakers reached a breakthrough in negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system of $700 billion (approximately $12 billion).
But there's no victory yet.
The Congress must complete a few details of the agreement before they can disclose the final form and vote of the law.
The draft financial system support will be discussed in the Parliament on Monday.
He informed the Reuters news agency on Sunday, President of the Financial Organizations Committee, Barney Frank.
According to Senate's sources, the draft is likely to be voted at the latest on Wednesday.
According to economists, it should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, it will then be “extended.”
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have taken a great step.
We have solved different views on the form of the market stabilization package," Bloomberg said, Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
He thinks the final vote may take place on Sunday.
The representatives of the Lawyer met on Saturday night with Henry Paulson, the U.S. Minister of Finance, to give the government a final form.
This should purchase unsale mortgages from financial corporations that bring financial firms into serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
“We are in a final agreement on a draft that will work and which must be effective on the market at the same time.
The corrective draft needs to be continued, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal of Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets that are weak.
According to Nevada Democrat Senator Harry Reid, the lawmakers are therefore trying to reach a final agreement at the Congress on Sunday.
Therefore, they want to reassure investors before trading in the Asian financial markets, where, as a result of the time zone, the Congress’s decision could first affect Monday’s trade.
However, it is not yet clear that the two chambers of the United States Congress voted on the law, as it does, whether the negotiation is not possible at the last moment because of a problem.
The lawmakers hope that the law will be approved in the following days.
However, the law is going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to support the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush's request, the first $ 350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress may block the remaining amount, which was determined at $100 billion and $ 350 billion later if it feels that the programme does not perform its function.
Bush evaluated the progress in the negotiations
Although the President may deny this decision, the Congress may, however, overthrow the opinion of the Congress.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was the acquisition of material assets for buying bad mortgage securities that lost their value, since hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay mortgage loans.
"We have developed everything.
The parliament should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
During the negotiations, President Bush was also pleased.
Tony Fratto, spokesman of Bush, said that the President was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated the "two-party efforts to stabilise our money markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of buse end-of-the-art defects
The Chairman of the Senate Bank Committee of Christopher Dodd, which leads the negotiations, said that the Legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of benefits and the timing of the financing draft.
The new law also restricts the end-of-the-job withdrawals of the directors involved in the programme and sets up a supervising committee.
The foundation should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We worked hard on this, and we made a great step towards an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on the help of the owners who have problems with the repayment.
The government should use new deductions to reduce the monthly deduction of debtors and allow them to keep their houses.
Marek: Lelki Help
The proposed draft is a good idea for David Marek, head of Patria Finance, but its implementation will be very difficult.
“It’s all because you can’t know what mechanism and the price the problem will be purchased.
This will be crucial for the financial sector and the government to share losses," said Marek to the iHNed.cz website this week.
Marek says it is not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of the next week.
“It’s much more important that the Congress has decided this week to support the plan, and as soon as possible, they will be blessed.
The spiritual importance of concluding that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Couples: MP3 Players v. Mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems that it’s better to just buy a phone.
However, there are many reasons for getting a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on how to use and the future owner’s needs.
It is probably hard to get a high-quality expensive record player at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on bakelit discs, but there are no objective reasons for this in quality.
However, if shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues bakelit discs, you probably dream of such a record player.
This is similar to the purpose of traveling, i.e. compressed - simplified by MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
Some people can be unacceptable to publish eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is probably hard to accept a 20 crowned market earphone.
There are two extremes that everyone has enough space.
There's a wide range of choices.
The lifetime of the elements also counts
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply playing music, but also the one that most mobiles accidentally do not even.
None of these devices are as universal as the phone.
You can play music and videos along with the primary features, telephone and SMS, record both, have a better and worse camera and even navigate.
And if we take account of smartphones and communications, your little computer will be in your pocket.
This is a little miracle, since no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph.
Multifunctional mobiles also have disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more the display sends to the charger.
And music play is one of the biggest energy sources.
There are few mobile devices capable of playing music for more than ten or twelve hours, mostly this is much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the easiest) are significantly more effective.
For cheap mobiles, you should count that they won't play for you for more than a few hours.
If you even call here and there, get a charger for your workplace for safety - this also applies to the more expensive devices.
MP3 players do not have such a problem, even worse people can hold at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one upload.
The next problem arises when uploading music to the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector and not all of them can be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only few card readers can handle without adapter with miniature memory cards used on mobiles.
Some exceptions (iPod) do not need any special software.
Enough to download the device from the computer with music via USB.
The majority of mobiles and players are already creating a music library that is set up on the basis of the author, album, genre, or, for example, on the basis of the user's assessment.
Some devices only describe fastruns like Windows Explorer, and you know some of them (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to manage, mobiles know more
When selecting a specific device, you should be interested in the lifetime of the battery, memory capacity, sound output quality and type and, of course, the comfort of treatment.
If music primarily serves you as a background and listens to you for a short time a day, for example, any mobile that plays MP3 is suitable for you.
This is what any mobile can do.
You don’t have to watch the music formats of your mobile or player.
With MP3, each of you will be able to cope and the decisive majority of music to you will be in such a format.
MP3 is among the most common and the decisive majority of the devices are also able to cope with WMA-format music.
AAC (formation used by Apple and its iPod) is less.
Better mobiles also allow online music purchases.
Enough to visit the right pages of the service provider (or other provider) through the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service can be a pressing argument for the acquisition of musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the service provider’s offer is limited to vacant and usually only one summer radio camps.
Prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that music will dominate such a way of selling (whether on GSM, on the internet or on the wireless internet) in the future.
Most people keep their mobile devices on their own.
Whenever you want to listen to something, your cell phone is in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is at home hever.
However, it depends on whether he always wears earphones or at least the speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker with almost every mobile but only a few MP3 players.
Many people are probably the biggest benefit of musical mobiles is the price.
The cheapest are usually less than 3000 crowns.
You can get a fair walkman between three and four thousand crowns.
However, mostly you are limited by the lack of the output of the traditional earphone.
The best and most technically equipped phones can be accessed up to 15 000 crowns with traditional 3.5 mm-diameters.
The advantage of players is, however, simple treatment.
The easiest - absolutely not everyone can handle the cheapest players (see our selection).
Minimum function, the treatment of previously standard tapes with magnó or gramofone is obvious.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of accidentally switched mobile internet, nor in the case of a huge account for data transmission.
What device to choose
The cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an opening to replaceable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
You can also purchase the right card for up to two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic types support cards with maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive can do what to do with up to 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and even a cheap MP3 player you want to buy, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
The capacity (max. 2 GB) does not need to spend more than 1 100 kroons.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobile walkers (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button and the comfort of the treatment is thus approaching the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson was the best user interface in the sector, which has the same user interface for mobile mobiles with walkman, as for separately sold MP3 players.
The MP3 players of the above brands can provide the same service in the same price category for four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours and up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider is still in Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The Czech mobile market is relatively advanced and our providers provide practically the same services as their Western European partners.
However, there is something missing here - the virtual service provider that forces classic service providers to reduce substantial prices.
Maybe it won't be long.
On Mobile.cz, we have often written that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This has been confirmed by ČTÚ, which has pointed out that the cost of SMS in Czech Republic is more expensive than the other countries of the Union.
Following the last step of the European Commission, roaming fees may thus have a contradictory situation - some of the Czech mobile providers from abroad will be cheaper than domestics.
How can Czech prices be so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking the competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory because we have three mobile networks and our penetration is highly above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile providers are pleased to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often agreed by Pavel Dvořák, the Chairman of the Czech Telecommunication Office, who has previously stated that there is no place for another service provider in Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic service provider is no longer likely to have too many chances with its own network (although it is probably hard to find frequency).
But there is another possibility - the virtual service provider.
The step towards the mobile market of virtual service providers has made a significant price reduction, which the classic service providers had to respond to.
In the meantime, even before entering the big fish market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in Great Britain, there were voices similar to ours.
However, it has proven that such providers have a place and can be truly successful.
However, for example, we do not need to go too far.
This February we informed you about the departure of the mobile service provider in Poland.
This service provider was able to acquire more than 100 thousand customers in not only half a year and become the fifth largest service provider there.
In the meantime, the Penta Financial Group is behind Mobilking, which is also owned by U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
For effective operation, the traditional service provider needs much less customers.
It does not have relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual providers in the world usually appear as a low cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which are often offset by less service.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper SMS than its competitors.
But as the example of the Polish Mobilking shows, it can be a good move to a target group.
This service provider focuses specifically on men.
"The real men choose the Mobilking service provider - who they like to trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company operating this virtual service provider.
It is difficult to tell if the idea of a similar to that in Poland can also work with us.
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman of Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach based on the majority of virtual providers.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory for the provision of services."
In Czech Republic, it is impossible to claim mobile providers
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but the negotiations in Czech Republic do not seem too hopeful.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studničková, spokesperson of the Penta Financial Group, said.
Indirectly, it has shown that the existing Czech mobile providers do not have an overcompatibility with this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to avoid any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider for a while, which would therefore want to take another step to make Phoneica O2 a real competitor on the field of business customers.
“We are very interested in providing not only wireless, but also mobile telecommunication services to our customers.
The sooner, the better.
This option has been discussed again with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already progressed in the negotiations,” says Pavel Kaidl, spokesperson of the group.
Maybe there's a better time.
From unofficial information, we may be lucky to the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by a wall of influential listening.
At this moment, we do not think that a full-value virtual service provider would have a place on the Czech market.
In contrast to the other markets, the Czech market is very special.
So far, we have not been called by an unambiguous subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," said Mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, Telefónica 02 press class.
Other service providers also refer to the specific situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, spokesman of T-Mobile, in agreement with O2, adds: “We have not yet recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects for which we could continue to be founded.”
And he added: "The T-Mobile network at the end of the year is unlikely to appear by any virtual service provider.
At this moment, there should be a specific agreement on our table so that we can think in such a short term."
Vodafone focuses on meeting its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider the most affordable for customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy is partnering in this area to build networks shared to the fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - a storm with service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another service provider would lead to an increase in competition, a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
Why should we facilitate the entry of such a competition?
When there is something important for service providers, they are able to work together, they also witness a huzavon around the birth of U:fon.
The biggest pressure on the ČTÚ is likely to be around the birth of the U:fon of the T-Mobile company.
This is the publicly available information on the ČTÚ website.
But right now, the U:fon comes as a good reason why we don’t allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of the competitiveness of the mobile market has recently been influenced by access to the market of the fourth mobile provider.
In view of the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is clear that another player’s entry to the market and services would rely on high requirements.”
However, in view of such attitudes of mobile providers, the total discomfort of Czech regulatory bodies is incredibly incredible.
Meanwhile, it is not only about ČTÚ's attitude, which, unfortunately, in Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no right to intervene in economic competition.
Only the Economic Competition Office has the right to do so.
However, the agency is typically relative to the whole problem.
"Acts of the virtual service provider to the mobile market would only be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider on the lease of the infrastructure needed.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, since the offer of potential interested parties is probably not very interesting for traditional service providers," he said to us in response to our question from the Department of External Relations of the Economic Competition.
A statement made by the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office that should represent consumers’ interests and also to ensure that no one can reside in its market situation, it is more than strange.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: “In the country where virtual service providers usually work, we can observe that their step into the market has contributed to the decrease in the price of mobile phone services.”
However, the interests of the UOHS are not likely to include the proper functioning of the market environment and the pressure to reduce prices.
In this case, it is truly shocking that the three mobile providers’ responses have a fairly affecting consistency.
The question is whether it’s just a coincidence, it’s almost self-interpreting.
As in the charging stations, the same gasoline prices are certainly only the works of accident and hard competition.
"The Office in this case did not discover the signs of anti-competitive proceedings, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers have a leading position, i.e. their market facts, or even more responsibility.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are probably missing by the telecommunication regulator," Chalupa said.
Introduction of the market leader is one of the many debate points.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, based on which telecommunication is the only market in the economic competition perspective.
Of course, there are no Czech service providers in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - the approval of the network operator to establish a virtual service provider is always necessary.
And the mobile provider - relatively logically - has its own network monopoly.
So in a certain segment it is necessarily dominant.
But even if we do not accept this argument, the UOHS should have a minimum incentive for three mobile providers to act in a very similar way.
At the same time, the complaints of interested parties (including the GTS Novera company already mentioned) show that they face very similar obstacles during the negotiations with all service providers.
Responsibility to ČTÚ is a relatively common trick in telecommunication with which the UOHS takes his hand from the whole case.
We've seen this in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunication Act, the extension of the competence of ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in the field of telecommunication failed, although many experts hoped to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS need to know this well, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one is watching
At the same time, there will be some false virtual service providers that already work in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, but they are only partially public.
This is multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife, and many others offer their own mobile services.
Price lists for these companies are usually only available to the selected companies.
The magic lies in the fact that the company performs as a classic corporate customer against the provider, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As a special customer, you will receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that all Czech mobile service providers are prohibited from having the same income.
"If there were cases that you were talking about, it could be a violation of contractual conditions that we would deal with and which could lead to co-operation with the company concerned," Martina Kemrova replied to our question of this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that news about this kind of activity would not have reached the responsible people of mobile providers.
In the case of three companies, it can be for thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider is protected against such a procedure.
They have no neglectable profits from the activities of these companies, and at the same time they, unlike the actual virtual providers, are not particularly threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns on possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however, only one percent of these companies use the services of their customers.
In addition, they have to accept that the SIM card is not included in their phone name, so they cannot have the full range as the general customers of mobile providers."
But that's exactly what the ČTÚ should do.
There is also another question for the UHS.
If mobile service providers close their eyes over a similar procedure, why do they hinder the birth of the virtual service provider?
It should be added that the UOHS has a relatively strong right to uncover such activity, and if you do not want it, it does not have to be satisfied with the service providers’ explanation that nothing has been said, and that trade conditions prohibit this.
When we are not the most expensive
As it has been mentioned in the text a few times, virtual service providers’ entry to the mobile market has caused a perceived decrease in the prices of services.
Meanwhile, in practically all countries where virtual service providers were established, classic service providers tried to prevent them from becoming more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in developing countries, at these moments, the regulatory authorities have intervened, not in any way the interests of mobile providers but their customers.
Then, either by formal measures or by informal pressure, the first virtual service was created, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators give the whole thing to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unambiguous competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider will appear soon, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If one of the providers would allow the establishment of a virtual mobile service provider, the UOHS can only be difficult to remain indifferent to reject further interested parties (discriminatory).
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be calling more expensive.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four new versions of the Czech state hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolának presented the new recordings of the state of the Czech state on the day of the day where my country is?
The band of the National Theatre confirmed the hymn by the leadership of Jiří Bělohlavs.
There are four versions available - male or female solo, singer or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are singing.
The authors of the change of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohláves consider the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful heritage.
The Czech Radio has previously said that to sing the solo variations, he has intentionally chosen young singers with representative voices that are expressive and popular.
“After the beginning of the beginning, I tried to take care of both of them and later at the band for pure dividence, well-understanding and consistency of the text,” he said.
The Czech state celebration will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song “Where is my country?” was first quiet in the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in its Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka, the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people were spontaneously considered their own.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became a natural part of the state's hymn.
After the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, the seven state symbols remained.
What's the "new" hymn?
The Prague transport company first delivers a chip card on Wednesday
On Wednesday 1 October 2008, he will write himself into the history of the Prague Transport Company when he enters the first passenger to metros, electrics and buses, whose electronic coupon will be in his pocket instead of a paper line mark.
The coupon is currently able to get about a hundred thousand who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase 30 days and 90 days and a year coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and also save their chip cards in the information centres and offices of the Transport Company at Muzeum, Mąstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kačerov and Luka subway stations.
Coupons can be purchased from yesterday via the Internet via the website of the Transport Company.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until afternoon hours.
Those who start using the internet trading can ultimately forget the metro stations' publishing windows where they had to regularly go through long lines for the line marks.
The coupon can buy it via the internet and the Opencard card is also stored on it in one of the thirteen accounts of the City Library.
“In these places, passengers have a bar trained server that helps interested in online shopping and saves their purchased coupon,” said Martin Opatrný, spokesman of the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons will be saved to Opencard in the self-service automation provided in some halls.
How do these automats look?
Red, ticket managers are reminded and passengers may have noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská subway stations.
“There are five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year,” Opatrný added.
The coupon is checked by the driver instead of the automobile
Management of automation that starts tomorrow is easy.
Just put the Opencard chip card in and the previously paid coupon is saved from itself.
Electronic coupons are not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So on trains and bus routes around the city from 300 to 499, with the inhabitants of the Central Czech Republic traveling to the capital.
"In the integrated transportation of Prague, fishing routes were provided with card readers to determine the validity of coupons in the zone," explained Filip Drápal with the Ropid organization compiling the plan of public transport in Prague.
In buses around the city, card readers are built in the cabinet.
The driver should therefore not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard on the wallet page.
The driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If, for example, a passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest thing is to ask the driver for this," he added.
Passengers who are not travelling by buses around the city and will not remember the validity of their coupons when they run down can go to self-service automobiles saving coupons cards again.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the device.
The Sudanes wanted a referendum from the US.
In 1945, the Soviet Germans were asked to join the United States of America.
This is from the letter that is in the collection of the Scientific Library in South Czech Republic.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the US patronate.
According to this desire, some of the Germans in Sudan turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This also appears from a private archive that is preserved today in the collection of the Scientific Library in South Czech Republic.
In the letter, the Germans of Česky Krumlov ask the President of the United States not to allow the reintroduction of the "šumawa County" to the Czech Republic, which Hitler has already held under the Munich Treaty.
"We have correctly interpreted the situation and really wanted to be sure in the words that the American troops will not come to the German areas as oppressors and enemies, but as a liberator," said in the letter, "Embers who wear Šumava's destiny on their hearts."
As the addition to Czechoslovakia can give hope to the Germans of Sudan, according to the knowledge of the Czech national character, only to brutality, mercifulness, non-understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protectorate over Šumava "most and forever".
“We cannot believe that, without regard to the opinion of four million people, this area would be regarded as a foreign country that will suppress and depress the minority, and it would not contribute to the victory of the allies,” he says.
The reason that the authors could not sign, is that the fear of revenge of "Cheh oppressors".
Therefore, if the President of the United States allegedly doubts about the opinion of the Sumawai Germans, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the Šumawa County on whether they want to become part of the United States and live under the patronization of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem somewhat naive in addition to the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians say that it correctly describes the expectations of the Sudanian Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to assume that they would be deployed from the country, only few of them were recognized.
Some people were expecting the United States and the United Kingdom to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudanes.
Others were confident that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovic.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German Budějovice during the war.
At the end of the war, the British arrested him and put him into the detention camp in Holshtynskó, and several dozens of other Czech Germans joined him to teach them in Czech.
“They were confident that when they came home, the Czech language would be good for them,” Chalupa said.
According to the German prisoners in Czechoslovakia before the war, no one was counted as being relocated from the country on the basis of Beneš Decretes.
You don't think - you pay!
The emotional campaign attacks leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history for the safety of the roads.
It would also be characteristic of the media campaign that affects emotions, which the Ministry of Transport will launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Śebíček's office from this campaign hopes he will alarm the leaders from the dangerous behavior behind the government.
The 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on the fictions.
The leaders should be alarmed from speed and alcohol.
And you should also remind them that their safety belts are sealed before they start.
First of all, younger drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians and not least professional leaders want to speak about their conscience.
What's in the ads?
The emotions are attacking, especially human stories.
This is also the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The term "you don't think" is written with big letters on the plate.
And the word "you pay" is in the blood clot.
This must indicate that a person can pay for a moment of attention in his life.
The viewers are "screamed" by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in English countries, where drastic images of victims of accidents can be viewed regularly.
They hope to reduce the number of accidents and dead on the Czech roads.
The advertising sites were created by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Pull it, let it to the drivers
"The driver's system of 'draw it, let it go' is valid.
It's 'off' for them, for example, when they go through the red, thus saving time.
The 'drawing' is the danger of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist of the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why the information campaign is needed in the press, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
He believes that the driver's attention is less effective.
"If the warning board is equipped, it is likely that it will quickly interact with the environment and the leaders will not deal with it," Kořan warned.
Olmert would return almost all the obsessed areas for peace
Ehud Olmer, the president of the provisional Israeli government, spoke of the practical return of all areas in 1967, i.e. the western shore of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Fennsík, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He said this in an interview, published on Monday by Jediot Achronot daily.
“We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means that almost all, if we don’t have to give back all the areas (inhabited),” Olmer told the daily newspaper.
“We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we need to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli areas because there will be no peace without it,” he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and wants not to go through tractors and bulldozers, as happened to one of the best friends, must give up part of Jerusalem," said Olmert, referring to two July cities in which some people were killed and few dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution for the Church Mountain, holy and historical places in the Old Town.
“The one who wants to maintain Israel’s sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he stressed.
Exit from the Golan Fennsík
Olmert also gave an opinion on the withdrawal of Israel from Golan-fennsík, which is an essential condition for the Peace Agreement with Syria.
This would also require some effort from Damascus.
“I don’t recommend peace with Syria solely on the basis of the exit from Golan,” he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they need to give up so they can get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollahhal (Síita Movement); they must give up the regular support provided to the terroristism of Hamas (Síita Movement), Al-Qaida and Jihad (Shita War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister explained.
Questions after an accident: Are passengers unlawful in buses?
The law does not know them, you should not walk in a distance bus
With regard to the tragic bus crash of the Student Agency company near Italy Padova, the question was whether passengers and passengers could travel in the bus.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the traveller’s activity is contradictory with the law on transport activities,” says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the driver of a truck crossing the bus was likely caused by the death of a 25-year-old passenger.
She was sitting next to the driver at that moment, at the least safe location of the bus, although there were even two more places for her.
The bus can crash or suddenly brake at the moment when the passenger serves coffee or offers newspapers.
It is important to see whether the bus has a seat under the driving licence.
If the bus is not homologized, passengers must sit.
The Student Agency’s remote buses have no locations, as confirmed by Radim Jančura, director of the company, to Aktuálně.cz.
“We have tried to find a solution with this ministry, and first passengers were not allowed to move.
However, it was withdrawn and we realized that passengers could go to a toilet during the journey if they had their own seats," he said.
The law does not know the passenger
"There is no clear legal regulation on the role of passengers - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the provision of services by the carrier.
The law on road traffic only knows the concept of a vehicle driver; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds less clearly the spokesman of Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, Director of the Transport Ministry of Transport Vehicle Operations Department, believes that the law properly deals with the problem.
“It depends on whether the bus has a station.
And it's over," he says.
Buses can be discriminated by urban locations where there are stations and seats with maximum speed and higher speeds between cities, as well as distances without stations and maximum speed, seats with seats with seats with seat belts.
As on the plane, the expert says
Jaroslav Hořín, the BESIP traffic safety expert, does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of passengers on board the bus.
“In the course of continuous progress, there is no danger, we can compare the situation to the service on the aircraft.
It’s not sure when there’s turbulence and the air passenger can beat his head.”
“But if the bus were suddenly braking, its physical laws are valid.
Same as in urban buses or electrics.
The safety of passengers must be solved by internal rules," he says, and he also believes that the problem has not been solved in terms of law.
Jančura is ready to terminate services
Student Agency offers traveler services as a single bus carrier.
He employs 200 passengers.
After the accident, the director does not consider their occupation as risky.
However, as I have the impression that the occupation of passengers is risky, I will end it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers on arrival.
It would be cost savings," he says.
In its vehicles, the lack of passenger accompanyers was justified by the safety interests of Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have passengers, we're against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it ends with some kind of fatal injury,” she told Týden.cz.
An incredible tragedy
The company was killed by a young passenger accompanying Pzeň for two years during a flight in Naples.
The Slovenian truck is likely not to use the direction indicator from the station and stopped the bus route.
The bus driver suddenly tried to get out with a manoeuvre, but the bus's right front hit him.
Jančura refuses to sell two reserved places to rest passengers.
"These places cannot be booked in distance flights, blocked."
The company wants to sue the driver of the truck.
With the reimbursement of the daughter’s family, the agency is not waiting for the court’s judgment, but also expecting financial compensation from the offender.
Amendment of law?
The Distant Future
Improving the movement of passengers on board the bus could be the amendment of the law that has been working for more than a year by a 30-person expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"The group did not have any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, rather the point system deals with the maximum speed on the motorway and mobile use during driving," says Hořín, expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not keep the activities of passengers, which would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers," concludes the spokesman Hanzelka with the responsibility of controlling the safety of buses by police and employment agencies.
Düsseldorf hopes come to Frankfurt
The letter written by the WestLB Board to the employees of the bank does not narrow down in large words.
From the merger of the Düsseldorf Monetary Institute and the Deka-Bank Frankfurt, the “Central Capital Market Organisation of the Financial Group of the Deca-Bank” could be created - writes the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a permanently profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a relationship could provide a decisive push for further mergers in the regional banking sector.
This is the reading of the time when a board wants to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
The unsecured WestLB bank continues to have a huge pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Service Authority, which has recently informed the North Rhine-Vestfalian Province Government that the deadline for finding a lasting solution is limited.
However, for savings customers, it has been a long time between Deka-Bank and WestLB on its investment funds.
Franz Waas, head of Deka-Bank, was already at the end of August, when the semester data were presented, not seeing the meaning of a bank and a regional bank located on Mainzer Landstraße, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which represents half of the county banks and the other half of the savings funds alliances, instructed the Board to carry out negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
In this case, capital market business or certain parts of it may be discussed.
However, the negotiations - they stop financial circles - have just just begun.
Deka-Bank’s name, among the most important employers of the financial sector in France, is not the first to consolidate the savings banking sector.
In 2003, Deka-Bank was united with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, there was nothing from this third alliance.
The plans were hardly disclosed, the Hesseni province government spoke against Helaba's interest.
The other two banks didn’t find each other.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was sent to Stuttgart Landesbank Baden-Württemberg instead.
However, again and again, the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and the county banks has been reintroduced.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, President of the Board of Directors of Helaba, has spoken against the plans of the mergers with his bank.
It is irrespective of this that it is necessary for the various banks of the sector to be approached.
Now, after the Bavaria province elections, the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected first.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If pressure on additional fusions is increased, potential partners can slowly run out.
In South Germany, only a younger business partner could be, where the financial crisis has so far been much better than the Munich and the Stuttgart banks.
The fusion with WestLB was excluded from Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen with a 85% business in Helaba at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB will stay in the right hand.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question is how different business models of each bank match each other.
In June, Merl stated that the German Monetary and Writer Association has not yet answered the final question of the business model to ensure the future of the regional banks.
In the end, it is still possible to cut WestLB, but they do not want to do so on their own.
Thus, the letter of the Board of Directors there also suggests that they seek a “full solution.”
How this is compatible with the merger of each unit with Deka-Ban, it is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend of Italy"
This is the first time for Luca, the third or fourth time.
Now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is different, says Luca.
Behind them, Kaiser’s brand five-litre barrel stands with a strong body-caped beard man and tells about 200 people who travel to Oktober paint how deep he can hover out of his throat.
Elena first finds Luca's face and then kisses her.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus bus station next to Puorta Nuova train station starts at 23.45 a.m. on "destinazione Monaco, festa della" with a view to arrival at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly held for Italians, in the fourth only travelling by Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking, the South Americans have been singing alongside their flag, and the celebration has already begun during the night.
And so loud that it's not for Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, a long, stylish jacket and a wide silver dried glass.
He traveled to Oktoberfest for five years, only three roads this year.
At night, the Oktoberfesten is home at 22.30 p.m.
The hotel would only be unnecessary, says Marco.
The road cost 75 euros, which includes the welcome Kaiser beer cooked in accordance with the Bajor Beer Cleaning Act, accident insurance and German-language tourism - Marco Frankfurt has conducted a German language course.
And the buses are throwing themselves into the night in the direction of Brennero on the road.
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will sleep.
All right, they'll need their power.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, there are a relaxation room where many Italian buses take a short break before Munich.
When Marco’s group arrives at a parking lot near Theresienwiese at half a week, there are almost 50 other buses that arrive from Europe all over.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco holds one last briefing, presents the military plan.
First of all, take the yellow hat.
On the left side, the letter "Oktoberfest" written by the fracture letters can be read, alongside Marco's travel office's internet address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When they open the gates of the beer, run," Marco screams in the morning.
"Fut!" Seize locations in the back of the tent.
"Not in advance, because we're stuck, and not in the same benches, all yellow hats, but scatter in the tent."
The one-litre bouquet costs €8.25 and shouts Marco.
And don't forget about the tip.
"Let the security guards behave you well.
As you leave your seats, they are busy!”
Thirdly, "Be back here at half a.m. tonight."
And now we're going to Wiesn.
As a guide, one man ties yellow hats to the trees, boards, and even one of the large champions’ popular posters.
You have to prepare for retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as "the weekend of Italy".
There are no exact figures; there are 50 thousand people who cross the Alpocks in the beer bars, ten percent of all visitors of the weekend are expected to arrive from Italy.
The Munich Police are reinforced by seven Southern Tripoli police officers, Italian volunteers help the Bajor Red Cross, which, in its national statistics, takes about 200 medical care from the Italians to the first place, preventing the Austrians (approximately 80) and the lowest degree of dobogo (approx. 60).
Among the Italians, the Hofbräu beer is especially loved.
Dreamless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed by Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück just last week.
Even fortunately, the politician used the word "extendedly" and even suggested that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because this happened this weekend.
Daxon’s registered München Hypo Real Estate (HRE) real estate finance company received billions of loans from the German banks’ consortium to protect itself against market turbulences.
One person who knew the situation told Reuters on Monday that credit support would be kicked to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only pays interest after the amount used.
Money comes partly from private, partly public banks.
In the background, Depfa’s subsidiary is lost.
According to a newsletter, Depfa financed long-term projects, and he refinanced himself for a very short period of time - which is now impossible due to untrust in the markets.
In the first semester of 2008, the bank's cash reserve decreased by 95% to 2.37 million euros and the share of its own capital decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
The current revenues and net revenues from cash transactions have returned to zero over the same period of the previous year, the revenues from credits to claims and specified securities, as well as from the liquidation of the target reserves of the credit transaction fell by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only due to higher revenues resulting from the reimbursement of the former Depfa Group’s subsequent accounts costs and the reimbursement of the interest rates provided for by the order and the business carried out by the consortium was relatively moderate on wheels by 16%.
The former State Financeer speculated first with corporate real estate loans after privatisation in 1990, which were subsequently separated in Aeral Bank.
Due to the lack of funding from the classic state, Depfa has increased its involvement in infrastructure projects and in joint projects between private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and has expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate must now carry out descriptions that have a "significant impact" to show the results of the group - it has been reported quite generally.
As a matter of fact, the payment of dividends did not take place.
The dividend has already been reduced to the third year by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure funder since the reception of Depfa.
In comparison to other financial institutions, it depends more on interbank refinancing as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the lending of banks between each other was lost because the banks kept their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets each year to refinance a portion of Depfa’s credit portfolio - about 50 billion euros.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered for the time available to the credit, and the company's protected "the influence of largely incapable international financial markets."
According to other sources, the refinancing is guaranteed by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, CEO of HRE, on the other hand, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group should not use the money markets for a reasonable period.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Service Authority (BaFin) see that the Hypo Real Estate Group is now in place.
This gives hope to the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But because of the dynamics and invaluability of the crisis, they cannot be certain.
It is not even unpredictable that funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
After Saturday's late evening news that the bank was still standing on the edge of your bankruptcy, even the transition to the same could not reassure the Tuesdays.
The stock exchange rate fell to 3.30 euros by 75 percent.
On the other hand, bond exchange rates are quite well maintained.
While the debts listed in the first place are hardly changing, the exchange rates of the lessor-ordered bonds have significantly declined.
The crisis, in particular, affects the former subsidiaries, the Württemberg Hypo bonds and, in a fair manner, the maturity of over 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds previously appeared to be a speculative investment alternative, their reliability should now be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system and due to the fact that the financial institution has taken the crisis almost home by taking Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less endangered business banks are still ready to support the system, the reimbursement of the benefits can be based on the deadline.
Or it is happening in which almost anyone currently dares to hope that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports related to partial nationalisation, the probability of certainty has now become just a legitimate remnant.
For long-term creditors, the decision can lead to uninspired nights to separate them from their investment.
Short-term investors may, however, use the sale to form a reserve for taxes to be paid after the exchange rate gains of the coming years.
The secrets of Sylvana and the indoor box
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce himself to Tachibana Highschool on the first day of teaching, the girls start snapping: The German girl is totally "kavai"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the mangs - she's talking about Japan in the new exchange school blog.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was very excited.
I was on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kavaszaki, and traveling to Tachibana Highschool for 40 minutes.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I wasn't wrong.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home, in Also-Sussia.
Students start to shout from eight hours until a short conversation with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the teaching began, I had the order to introduce him.
I'm not the type who's happy to talk to people, especially in front of a 40 student class.
Because I haven't had my school uniform yet, I picked up an old skirt of my hostess, bleached, blue knees and black leather shoes.
So in this dress, I stood in front of the cathedral, and I tried to correctly say, "Sajonara, no Sylvana, I'm called Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and I'm going to have my birthday in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I started learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls whispered, squirted and shouted, and I always heard the word "kavaí".
I already knew that from my mangas.
This belongs to the base treasure of Japanese girls, and it means "cuki, sweet."
Then I quickly went to my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled widely, it was an honor that she was sitting next to the exchange school.
The rest of the hour was calm enough, but when the bell was spoken, they ran regularly.
Everyone spoke and laughed, and they drilled a hole in my stomach with questions - and it was quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
At the break, everyone packed his indoors.
My guest also made me such a lunch - it's completely different than the boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I got spice rice, small sausages, salad, fruit, and meat made from cucumbers and algae.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat in Japan.
Foods look strange, and they taste completely new.
In fact, everything is very delicious.
Yeah, maybe, except for salted lime juice, brrrr.
In Japanese schools, indoors are not just lunch.
It happens that a girl presents a benzo made to a boy with his own hands, which is particularly artistic, in the hope of getting closer to the boy in the lunch break.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can see this here too.
“Why is Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always answered:
"Because you're just charming me."
After all, I’ve been reading the mangs for many years.
And to understand the comics and culture described in them better, sometime I started studying in Japanese.
It was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I am attracted to tradition and habits.
And they're very honored here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the largest city I’ve seen in my life.”
Rats also have emotions.
If a rat or a moth is at risk, does that mean you are afraid?
Joseph LeDoux's neurologist is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can they look at whether they feel the same when they act like us?
In the Internet Journal "Edge", famous scientists have published their articles for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in one of the series, “What does it hold real without being proven?” sees from the answers received to the question.
I believe that animals have emotions and other state of consciousness without being able to prove this to me or anyone else. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
However, in this case we can at least hope that all human brains are the same.
However, as we look at other species, and in general we autopsy the issues of consciousness, we come into a difficult field because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is at risk, he does the same thing as many other animals: he pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People are acting in a similar way, from which some researchers result in comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to the animals.
On the one hand, the circuits related to human consciousness are almost always included in the side prefrontal brain (as a result of its role in short-term memory and implementation/management functions).
This wide area is more advanced for man than other mammals, and it seems to be completely missing in other living creatures.
At least with the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal brain, such as the consciousness of who we are, or in the case of planning and decision-making ability, it is reasonably assumed that man differs from other mammals.
Another dramatic specificity lies in the language nature of man: As a significant part of human experience is related to the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if it is not depending on the language of consciousness, the language would certainly affect, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature is, is likely to vary strongly from the majority of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness can be like for other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective matter, and because of our experience, it will not be analysed, then your research will bring us to serious problems.
Most of my headlines apply to the content of conscious life, but also there is another aspect of consciousness, which is likely to be easier to access to science.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without regard to content, and this is precisely done in the case of experiments on short-term memory of the mammals, especially in the example of visualisation.
However, in the assumptions examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely on the neural contexts of consciousness rather than on the cauzal mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of prefrontal brain cancer in the formation of visualization.
What is going to happen to these emotions?
I recall that an emotional system, such as fear, is activated in the brain that knows its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain-based protection system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) takes the work memory.
In this way, the emotions are closely linked to the areas of the brain curtain which are characteristic of the main mammals and especially human beings.
In addition to the linguistic nature, sensation belongs to fine degrees, because with the help of words and language, we are able to distinguish and categorize the conditions so that we can describe them in addition to others.
Antonio Damasio, for example, feels that emotions come from simpler activities in the brain and brain-breathing areas, just like Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses on brain-breathing.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the emotions that cover species.
Theoretically, I can't deny it, but I think it's undeniable.
Pankseep believes that what seems to be fearful in rats and people, in both cases, is likely to feel like: How can rats and people feel the same when they act similarly?
A dragon escapes in the event of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, only such behavior is not evidence of the same experience.
Although neural complication continues to help: rats and people are similar to brain circulating, the rats do not even have brains.
But is the brain wrestling responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proven for humans: how can we prove this for rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, but maybe even the cattle (who knows?) have emotions.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And since their emotions are fundamentally different from ours (which is based on special circuits and languages of human consciousness), I'm looking for the emotional behavior of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is made at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
As I do not research the language and consciousness in rats, neither do I know the emotions, because I don't know if they exist.
This may seem to be a short-sighted attitude, but I'd rather move forward than continually hit the wall.
I'm a practical physicist.
Platini, President of the UEFA: Mercy Time for Poland and Ukraine
Ukrainian Vice-President Ivan Vaszjunik said that the preparations are shortly under direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government, in its decision of the UEFA bordeaux, sees confidence in Ukraine and its testimony that they believe that Ukraine can organize the European championship together with Poland," he said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is a lot to do in both countries.”
For the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both hosting countries are missing.
The number of EB stadiums may be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
“We have to work with skies,” said Grigorij Szurkis, President of the U.S. Football Association.
“The UEFA will keep an eye on us.”
In Poland, they have taken a more radical step.
Following several scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN alliance, replaced by independent Commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission was convened on the initiative of Mr Drzewiecki sports minister.
“It is a danger that PZPN is unable to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki said to the Polish PAP news agency.
"We have assured Michel Platini, President of the UEFA that this will not adversely affect the preparations of the European Central Bank in 2012."
Only in the past season, several first liga teams had to be assigned to the lower class because of manipulation, and eventually the ligastart had to be postponed.
Disgusted Dennis Quaid Cuts Back
The actress wanted to advertise a new movie, talking about his privacy in the interview, and now he had a problem with his ex-husband. And Ryan Hollywood's star classified his former husband as a bride, Dennis Quaide.
Who's hanging and slicing back
The late rose war of Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex-part: The two Hollywood actresses seven years after their divorce struggles with each other - before the public.
And Ryan in the U.S. InStyle interview last week said the reasons for divorce: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, causing a lot of pain."
After the divorce, he found out how many women Dennis cheated on him.
The spiritual strip was done because of Ryan's new press work on "Women" film, which tells the story of a marriage break.
Dennis Quaid strongly responded to the unfaithful man's advocacy: "Great" - said the 54-year-old actress on the New York Daily News newspaper, "to repeat and move the story of our relationship."
In addition, it’s “sacrifice” that 16-year-old boys, Jacket, once again, “is manifestly reminded of many pains and changes caused by divorce to a child.”
While Ryan has lived alone since his divorce, Quaid was married again and recently became a father of a twin.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following side cut: "My life continues anyway.
I am happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is fine.”
Prices of flights and hotel rooms are reduced
In the first semester of 2008, European airways and hotels were cheaper than last year.
According to a current study, airways in Germany were not less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of airlines and hotel rooms have been again more favourable - so the result of one study of American Express travel and financial service providers can be summarised.
The company analysed the first semester of 2008 booking data and, after the first quarter price increase, established a significant price fall in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, many hotels have become cheaper.
From January to March, prices increased by 41 per cent of the 48 European cities examined compared to 6.9 per cent in 2007.
However, during the period from April to June, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
This trend appeared in the most unequivocally in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees the reason for this in the low exchange rate of the dollar, which led to "reliefing travel for American tourists".
The reduction of hotel room prices affects more financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, 26.3% increase in hotel prices is considered a European record.
In the first quarter, there has been an increase in flight prices.
Due to the abundance of kerozin, passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more in the tourist class than in 2007, and long-term airways with high fuel demand cost 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of tourist-class flights decreased by 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, however, the prices in business and first class showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Prices increased by 11.9 per cent between January and March, and decreased by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the cost of domestic flights in Germany fell to half.
On the one hand, the reason for price reduction lies in moderate economic growth - says the company.
The demand is weakened in many segments of the airway market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement to liberalise air travel between the United States and Europe increases the pressure of competition.
The tense situation proves that airlines cancel their loss flights, and that many airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008, only in Europe, it affects 24 airlines.
Gladbacho is hit by HSV 1:0
A goal and simple methods were put on the edge of the tabella in Hamburger SV.
Luhukay still fails to find a working team in Borussia.
Kristoffer Klein Enlargement Deep Flight for the National Selected Marko Marin.
The gladbachi player just got into the game late and lifted back from the gate.
His precise message has left his lips very convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
“We need the second goal,” Hermann Rieger sparked the corridor of the Hamburgian arena cabins.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them were sitting in their place again.
Rieger has been the physicist of HSV for almost three decades, and he enjoys greater authority than a few haunted players.
So your request was found in the competent place.
Cornelius Jol's assistant coach smashed his thumb and agreed to show his thumb.
Cornelius is the head coach of Hamburg, the brother of Martin Jol.
His command could have said the same way: Here's the second goal.
The order has not been executed.
“Today it wasn’t always a nice sight,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, was “in the looseest way” to do it.
1: 0 (1: 0) is a goal-based result due to Mladen Petric’s head (11.) and the condition that very weak gladbachians could not cause pain on the weak hamburgers.
"It was a small victory," Martin Jol summarised.
Hamburger SV will now be 121 on Monday.
The viewers have celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table that appeared on the screen, which presented their team as the top of the championship class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
"We know where to do this," Marcell Jansen said.
It believes that the intermediate certificate of the tabella is more predictable than the dominance of the HSV.
Although the team, thanks to its lately committed works - the Brazilian Name and Silva, the gate to Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern, will slowly find itself, but will not yet brilliant.
"We need more senses and acts," Jol demanded.
After the vote
Wall Street is in fear.
The first news on the failure of the rescue package led to Dow Jones temporarily falling 700 points.

Just a few days earlier he purchased a share in the bank in Warren Buffett’s big investor.
As part of the rescue measure, resources are intended to be made available to purchase so-called double mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not intended to be paid at the same time, but gradually.
In exchange, the State would receive shares of financial institutions, which would be used in the event of appropriate developments in exchange rates, reducing the burden of the state fund.
European and American exchange rates and shares

Dark material affects the flight of spacezones
A mysterious phenomenon has been inconvenient among researchers for years. Dark material affects the speed of spacezones during the so-called swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts are afraid that Albert Einstein's general relativity cannot be completely correct.
The "Ulysses" spacezone flew in space for almost 18 years.
The soon-freeze fuel wires threaten the cold death.
Among scientists for years, there is a mysterious phenomenon, swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by means the gravitational price of spacezones, in which an additional momentum is made in a heavenly body, such as the Earth's gravitational field.
So the sonds can save a large amount of fuel.
A European-American Cassini-Huygens research team used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses sunshine.
What, however, has attracted researchers for years: Flying objects do not act completely as it would be expected under the ancient gravitational law.
Instead, abnormalities occur at speed.
The sonds are unexpectedly speeding up or slowing down.
The physicists have not yet found an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was baptized as an anomaly of swing-by.
Some experts are afraid that even Albert Einstein’s general relativity cannot be completely correct, which will consider the mass rolling of the material as a curve of space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist, the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong and attempts to explain Swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark material discovered by the astronauts in the universe.
"For anomaly, the dark material may be responsible, which may be found near Earth," writes Adler.
The world space researchers have only been aware of the existence of dark material for ten years.
Obviously, it creates a gravitation force that can be observed by the impact on other sky bodies.
However, the substance itself is completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light does not release or beat back.
According to scientists, a good fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark material.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt were released
After ten days in the captivity of their kidnappers, the tourists captured in Egypt are again free - the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed it.
Sudanese kidnappers demand millions of euros of ransom.
In the shooting before the hostages were released, six hostages were reported to have lost their lives.
In South Egypt, five German citizens were kidnapped.
Negotiations on the ransom fee are already underway.
Again and again, Germans become targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports the most important cases.
European tourists in Sahara are free.
This has been reported consistently by the Egyptian public television, the Arab TV of Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
According to Italian Sky TG 24 television broadcasters, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: "Our colleagues and other hostages were released.
We are currently investigating their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, and a Romanian citizen, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and safe - reported by the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are supposed to be on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting before the hostages were released: Egyptian security officials said that the hostages have already shown their willingness to release hostages when the Sudanese Army surprisingly killed their six.
"The problem has been solved.
They accepted the ransom," said the official.
"It was only about the reception of hostages," he said, "the surprise."
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers in the border areas between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two.
The hostages demanded six million euros of ransom from Germany; the money should have been transferred to one of the German hostages.
The "al-Masri al-Jom" newspaper, referring to a German intermediary, reported that the release of hostages is withdrawn because the kidnappers are concerned about their own integrity.
According to the report, hostages are released after payment of the ransom.
Men are held by kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"They led to murder" by Pope's violence
The court stated that a woman was killed by suicide because his stepfather had raped her for years.
Cornwall County Stithians, 57 years old Michael Trerise, spent six years in prison after a strong confession of attempting eightfold violent sex.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that he regularly tied his stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's confessions, he wrote, "I feel exalted for his death."
The trial stated that Randle, at 34 years old, was committed to suicide at home in the Mutley Quarter of Plymouth, on April 1.
When he lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied him up and tied his eyes in front of the joints, while his mother worked in a beer shop.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and re-elected Cornwall.
His stepmother moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust Monument Protection Organization, was persecuted by the fears of repeating violence twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously passionately loved surfing and cycling, said his friends "sense dead" and "speaking about life".
In April 2007, his father Terrance Randle found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle was confronted with his daughter's nephew who ended her confession in a letter: "I always tied her up and tied her eyes.
I wasn't sexually harassmented.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You were extremely strange fetishist and sure it was terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended by the fact that the victim was suicide.
But even more remarkable is the fact that if he did not do so, the case could never have been brought before the court.”
The judge added: “I would like to draw attention to the impact of Stephanie’s parents on their daughter of crime that you have committed over the years.
If this didn’t happen, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.”
The officials who lost the important data were accused of
According to the BBC’s reports, the government official is accused of infringinging the secret of office, who left strictly secret documents on a train in June.
The man's experts were posted from the Department of Defense when he left two strictly secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were transferred to the police.
This is the easiest accusation of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of deliberate crime.
Frank Gardner, a reporter from the BBC Department of Defense, said that many were surprised at Whitehall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the Government would treat the case as an internal case," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed was charged under point 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph is about the preservation of information.
The state prosecutor recommended that the accusation against the Officer be represented by the Metropolitan Police by the man due to his rather sensitive work on the Joint Public Procurement Committee.
The documents he lost included secret surveys on Al-Qaida and the ability of the Iraqi Army.
On Monday, he was informed of the decision and then moved to an unknown place from his home.
House building cooperatives pay the B&amp;B account
UK housing cooperatives can count for more than 80 million English accounts after saving Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The government spent 14 billion £2.6 million in order to protect its deposits at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest rates of this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of deposit holders, including 59 housing-building cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, the President of the Association of Home Constructions (BSA), it is "ashamed" that companies and members must pay.
The 14 billion major loans will eventually be reimbursed after the repayment of Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgage.
However, the interest accumulated in the period will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Discount System has confirmed to BBC that 59 housing building cooperatives are among them.
It is annoying that the institutions that have already been carefully held must now pay the accounts of the institutions that were much less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We found that all companies have to pay in such a proportion as the amount of deposits they own. Companies share between each other on 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan will reach 450 million in 2009.
This means that companies need to mislead 81 million pounds to pay first year interest.
Adrian Coles, head of the trade union of housing companies, told BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
"It is advocate that those institutions must pay the accounts of the less prudent institutions, which have taken care of during the recovery of the housing market."
According to BSA, none of the companies have failed since they started operating in 1945.
“In all respects, we need to examine this case in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing building companies and members from a significant amount of account,” Cole added.
In 2009 the interest rate will cover 7 months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, a full year interest will be paid, which can be twice the current interest rate.
Since housing cooperatives are self-helping organizations without shareholders, they will eventually have to pay the account by members, either by higher fees or by lower interest rates after their deposits.
The price of milk increases by five pennys per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The dairy company in Jersey announced that it will increase the price of milk wholesale by five pennys from Monday to litres.
This is the second price increase this year since the February two penny rises and after an advisory company survey.
Resellers decide whether to transfer price increases to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last changed in 2002.
The former representative of Bangladesh has refused the request to protect freely
The Bangladesh Court rejected the request for protection of former MEP Sheikh Hasina, which means that they can be arrested when returning to the country.
His attorney said that the court refused to defend him on the grounds that he was blackmailing a businessman at the time of his parliamentary representation for 50 million dollars (729,700 dollars).
This is just one of the countless corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent Khaleda Zia was released this month.
Sheikh Hasina must return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but the party, the Awami League, demands that the temporary government supported by the Army, give him full freedom first.
According to the reports, although conditionally freed to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear from the conditions for placing on the free leg that you can preserve your freedom when you return to the country.
His lawyers say that he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
"The appeal court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for a warranty that it is not necessary, as it was placed on a temporary basis and involved in foreign treatment," we learned Rafique from Huq's lawyer.
"We're going to improve against the decision of the Court of Appeal."
According to his lawyers, he needs protection on the patent to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
Last year, the temporary government supported by the Army took over the power, but in June, he was released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny any accusations against them.
concerns about the Afghanistan Polyo Vaccination Programme
According to the United Nations, nearly 200 000 Afghanistan children were left out of the recently organised polio vaccination programme due to Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations has organised a vaccine in six counties.
However, they said that for safety reasons they could not reach the children of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
According to the United Nations, this happened despite the fact that the Taliban promised: they will not attack or hinder the work of thousands of staff to be vaccinated.
BSkyB's appeal to ITV has been rejected
BskyB's appeal was rejected against the decision of the Competition Committee, which ordered to reduce its interest in the rival TV, ITV.
The Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share from 17.9% to 7.5% in ITV.
In the past, the Committee found that BSkyB's share of the company would hinder competition and dishonestly influence the company over the ITV.
BSkyB purchased its share in 2006 and effectively prevented NTL, which has since been renamed for Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Office announced that the share acquired by BSkyB from ITV would jeopardise the independence of ITV, encouraging the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's director, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's supervisors were all opposed to buying.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of ITV participation is unreasonable and disproportionate - especially in view of the fact that BSkyB has stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation of the case of US prosecutors
The U.S. main prosecutor appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the executive of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The step followed that the report made by the Chief Inspector of the Judicial Wall criticized the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized the White House officials, the Lawyers and the former chief prosecutor, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was fearful that the prosecutors were rescued from political consideration.
Nora Dannehy, a special prosecutor will now investigate whether the investigators in the investigation have tried to prevent justice by lying.
"The serious accusations of possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not been clarified," Glenn Fine, Chief Inspector.
One of the main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor who has the power to declare witnesses.
The series began with nine prosecutors removed from the US judicial wallet in December 2006.
At the time, the prosecutors were released because of their weak performance.
However, it later turned out that the exiled prosecutors had nothing worse than many of their other colleagues, which led many to the conclusion that political consideration was drawn behind dismissals.
Some state prosecutors participated in the prosecution of highly ranked Republican Congress members, while others refused to participate in the investigation of election fraud charges against democrats.
The U.S. prosecutors are investigating the government's order and conducting court cases.
They can be saved at any time, but they cannot be removed from their position for political reasons.
At the time, the head of the Justice Wallet, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of the attacks of the main prosecutor of state for the redemption and eventually resigned.
Many other officials of the Justice Wallet also gave up their resignation.
In his report, Gonzales greatly criticised his role in the case. He believes that the main prosecutor is “primary responsibility” for dismissals, “subjected” and “excellently removed” from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former helper of the older Bush, criticize the lack of cooperation in the investigation.
Meat Loaf Eposa Gets Recognition
The rockstar Meat Loaf will receive an acknowledgement on the Q Awards Prize Gale for the epic hymn of "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer who receives a special gold-grade prize next week at the London celebration said it was honored.
The nine minutes, fifteen seconds long song Meat Loaf, was a song of the album of the public workstation in 1977.
The Coldplay received most of the entries for this year's fees, four categories of candidate lists.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that cross the borders of time or genres and "Bat Out Of Hell" like that.
Jim Steinman’s song demanded a very big sound, and this sound was Meat Loafe.
The song began with almost two minutes of instrument.
He appeared as a small album in 1979, and he was on the hit lists to the 15th place.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" was present on the hit lists for almost nine years and then sold over 40 million copies of it.
Meat Loaf - a real name Marvin Lee Aday - has recently had health problems. Among others, in 2003, she had a heart rhythm disorder after she collapsed on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to severe genital inflammation.
Later, it turned out that there was a cigar on the noise.
An unknown city street that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of radiation, tours and other sideways. Some of them are famous, others are merely practicing.
However, many trained taxis drivers and long-time local residents can hardly tell where the Extra Place is, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village and heads north from the First Street - without reaching the Second Street - between the Bowery and the Second Railway.
Approximately 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more similar to a dusted alley than a main route of transport.
There are no street boards.
In practice, it cannot be found on a standard map.
However, the street has admirers.
There, for example, is the building of the newly built first street luxury buildings in Avalon Bay.
He wants to bury Extra Place again and ensure that new buildings’ shops and butiks can be accessed in a cleaner way.
The admirers of the street include the long-residents of the neighbors who have been caught in the csonka street that this was the only remains of the past before the renovations of the area.
However, the owner of the street, the city’s building and development department, is not required.
In this month, at a meeting of the Regional Administration Committee of the Regions, the city and the representatives of Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the Committee would like the street to stay in the city and ask for a new plan to be submitted next month, Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the municipal body No 3.
“There are very few areas in the town, and we want Extra Place to remain in the city,” he said.
"There are proposals for renovation and management that Avalon can do, but we also want to ensure that it is available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that he wanted to hide the small street again and he wanted to hold seats. Some of these would be used by a café that the builder is expected to rent a area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first published at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that although the company would like to use the street, he did not want to hold it.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renew this destroyed alley and make it a pleasant public sound," he said, adding that the city recommended buying it.
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the Office for Conservation, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and noted that the office was responsible for buildings and not its management.
Compared to Bowery’s more colorful neighbor, Extra Place does not have much historical significance.
According to some, in 1802, he received the name "one land" when Philip Minthorne’s great possession was divided among his numerous children, and no one kept a demand for narrow land band.
The Punk Rock monument closed in 2006, the back exit of the CBGB was opened to Extra Place, and the street might be the most popular photo of Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album cover.
"Remek was a location," said Danny Fields, director of Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
"He was full of garments, dresses with girls, barrels and poster pieces, and wooden leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how they own East Village in the middle class, oppose the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, whatever modest it is, must remain in the community.
Others mention Extra Place as a rareness, which is a virtually unchanged piece of the city and which must be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, a blog writer of "Jeremian disappearing New York" (The Book of Scripturees: a bitter nostalgia of the city's extinction process), published a part of the story of Extra Place, which was published in the article "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote, "The Extra Place is a narrow, small puppet that even during the day is dark, bound by stainless, iron rocket doors and spalet windows, and where the wind wears one week of newspapers in the channels."
The street, except for some exceptions, looked the same way a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street, next to the back door, which used to lead to the CBGB, and now belongs to a higher priced clothing store.
There was a graffiti on the walls, and an empty, 0.75 liter beer bottle was lying next to a thrown fresh paper.
Some passengers say they rarely think of Extra Place, but they think it would be necessary to renovate.
Fields said that some people underestimate their attractiveness in the current state of the street.
“I’ve spent the most beautiful years in dark, squirrel and unpleasant places,” he said.
Discussion on two-language education: Continual exposure to the English language environment
In this part of the Education Monitor Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the opinion of candidates on two-language education.
Lance T. Izumi, a experienced researcher and director of education research in the Csendes-American Institute for Public Political Research, the "Not as good as you think, why the middle class needs school choices" book.
It is not easy to favour voters from Spanish languages.
Barack Obama's proposals for education are also here.
Obama’s campaign says “Afro-American and Spanish lip students will obtain a degree significantly less likely than white students,” and that’s true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama’s education plan expressly supports "transition two-lingual education" for English students.
At the same time, Obama’s commitment to dual-language education, which highlights school education in non-English, is overlooked by its interest in combating high performance differences.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep contracted general school in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the students of the school have Spanish lips and low income.
More than a third of students - many of whom have recently arrived - learn English.
However, 100% of the fourth graders achieved an excellent result in the 2008 state mathematics test.
Similarly, it is impressive that 93% of the fourth graders have completed excellent English language and literature exam.
This incredible performance was not achieved by the instrument that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street emphasises repeating, practicing, continuous evaluation of skills and rejecting objections.
In addition, and this should be taken into account by Obama, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s education principle is the “full watering of English students” into the language environment.
The essence of the watering method is almost exclusive use of English in teaching other objects.
Mikels, who opposed dual-language education, said: “We made a great success in walking in a classroom, would not notice who was the student who came from Mexico 12 months ago.”
"It's working," he said, "We're working."
Would Obama be an example of other schools educating Spanish lips and English students like Sixth Street Prep?
The results achieved by the school should be clear to answer, but because of the education policy of its own party (the National Education Associations have long supported dual-language education), and since they themselves are consistently opposed to dual-language education, we cannot be sure of the reaction of Obama.
Although you agree that immigrants need to learn English, Obama recently expressed a remarkable statement about the question when he said that people should not worry so much about the "only English."
Instead, he said, "they should be able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to achieve the difference between the results, you should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and taking them nothing.
The price of oil was rigorous due to the renewed concerns of the economy
On Monday, oil prices were rigorous because of the concerns that America’s financial market rescue plan would not be able to revive the economy.
Raw oil's securities went back to $99.80 this morning on the New York Trading Stock Exchange.
Prices have been reduced by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the stock exchange has been undermined by Wall Street's financial disruption and some powerful hurricanes in the Mexican Bay.
After the prices reached $ 145.29 per barrel in July, the price dropped to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month before the re-influence of the immeasurable uncertainty of financial markets.
On Monday, investors were reintroduced by concern even after the Congress’s leaders announced that they managed to agree on the economic rescue action that is the biggest in history.
The news has been shadowed by the concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
The latest events of the emerging crisis will be purchased by Citigroup to the Wachovia Corporation banking sector, announced by the government on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, the result of the desperate weekend consultations, “it seems that the rescue action has failed to restore the trading of stock exchanges.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for goods, such as oil, is expected to also decrease.
“The future of the market for stock shares, interest rates and exchange rates has become uncertain worldwide,” wrote Deutsche Bank an analyst for investors.
"We believe that the market of goods will not be avoided by the "rumor".
The biggest question for the stock exchange is the extent to which the U.S. "sickness" infects the whole world, especially China."
As oil consumption decreased due to the slowdown of economic growth, the analysts of banks fell from their expectations for the next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 20%.
With the second quarter brave, the team set up its record
After the last eight seasons spent more time in the Jets field than anyone else, Shaun Ellis in the Defensive end position thought he had seen everything.
But then he looked at the opening of the second quarter on Sunday, when Jets changed a pointless game to a sensational messenger.
"I've never seen that before," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully matched with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave 12-yard touchdown paste to Laveranues Coles. It became a perfect predecessor for a afternoon in which their generating cooperation has evolved significantly.
Favre gave Coles two touchdown pastes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't regret the effort," he said to Fav about all the passports given to Coles.
He's a hell of a good player.
We have been able to communicate well with each other, regardless of what people think.”
While Favre and Coles played balls, the defense stopped the Cardinals controller, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis in the cornerback position caught a bad throw and threw it back with 32 yards worth touchdown.
Eric Smith, a safety player, got into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to hit the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing game.
However, when Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and Jets got it, Jay Feely kicked 20-yard field, setting 34:0 results.
This was the best result the Jets has achieved in a quarter.
When they asked the Jets coach Eric Mangin to characterize the logical nature of the game, he said, "The second or the third quarter?"
When they told him that both - in the third quarter Cardinals got 21 points so that Jets didn't get one - Mangini said, "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third.
We got a lot of points in a short time."
The rested Gebrselassie is deciding its own world record
The Ethiopia Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many of the best mid- and long-distance drivers ever lived in Berlin when he turned his own world record on Sunday. He became the first to run 42.2 kilometers in 2 hours 4 minutes.
On the comfortable plane track, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds by winning in the time 2:03:59 in Berlin last year at 2:04:26.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set up the 26th world record of the career of Gebrselassie in so many areas that from 1500 metres to marathon had gained a World Championship in almost every proximity to the world record.
Over the past month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Peking - which may have proven to be too cautious - that air pollution would further exacerbate her asthmatic problems.
Instead, he called me to Berlin Marathon.
Only in almost perfect circumstances - in a daytime, at the beginning of 9 °C and at the end of 13 °C - won Gebrselassie on Sunday, incredible at 2 minutes of 56 seconds per kilometer.
Since the marathon runners, such as Gebrselassie, and Paul Terga, Kenya, have turned towards the long runs, the marathon record has fallen more than two minutes in the past decade since Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa in 1998 with the result of 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago his two legs were rubbed and couldn’t train for two weeks.
Obviously, under the forced rest, it was refreshed and it was not rusted.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but finally everything was fine.”
He received some criticisms - especially from Kenya, Ethiopia’s Eastern African rival - that he uses too many tools during his competitions, usually avoids many world-famous marathon runners, leaves to iramfutors as if he runs on the track and puts world records in front of the competition spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie’s greatness in long-distance.
On Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the point of departure under 1:02:04.
Two-line Kenya runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the iram runners were exhausted.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometres before the target, Gebrselassie abandoned Kwambai with the last sprint, who was targeted as a second at 2:05:36, 5 minutes on its individual best.
Kamathi came into the third in 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, closed a remarkable year with the fastest victory of the seventh, 2:19:19.
The World Summit is held by British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
In the last spring, Mikitenko, a 36-year-old, won the London Marathon with the result of 2:24:14.
He was unable to participate in the Peking Olympic due to the alleged back injury, but he quickly healed and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved his individual peak five minutes. This was the third marathon quest to which he participated.
He gained the competition with a reasonable expectation: first, he allowed a four-person group of ethiopia and kenyai to advance and to take a significant lead, and then came after about 30 km.
The Ethiopia Askale Tafa Magarsa was targeted in the second time at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, became the third result of 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and trials of the black
In the Greater Orland experience park, a few miles away from everything that shines, loud and huge - a quiet small town where the pride and complexities of African American life have been born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city that entered the country, and which was Zora Neale Hurston’s childhood home, was no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: “The five lakes, three croquet tracks, 300 brown skin, 300 good swims, lots of guawa and two schools without prison.”
Now it's a pilgrim.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have been to the Zora festival organized every year. The festival series of eatonville is considered to be the most famous female writer of Harlem Renaissance, Hurston.
However, in many respects, the city described and made a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida Roadbook issued by the Federal Writers of the Crimea period, is separate from the environment.
As independent, dignified and closed as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that the floridan, city blacks often refused to share their real thoughts with white people who “a little of us know that they don’t know what they’re missing.”
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate Barack Obama opens his mind on the racial question, many of them are untrusted to the outside looks.
"We look after how to tell our story," said the 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life, and member of the oldest church in the city.
"We have to say it correctly."
Eatonville has long been characterized by winning and fighting with paradox.
At the same time, it is a historical model for black withdrawal, while a nearly 2400-person community where poverty indicators reach the national average double.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example of American slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture that flows in the shadow of oak trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the residents here are both proud and defenders at the same time.
The picture of Eatonville has been important since Zora (then everyone calls Hurston).
In the books written in an honest, strong dialektus, like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937), he introduced his hometown to the world.
The five sections of the Florida Guide transformed the city along the 17th road. This path leads to a location of the history of the black and human drama from the old-forgotten centre of Florida.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, even the drummer, introduced his readers to Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke’s business, and then reviewed the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: “We will find the modern public school right from the road, with a brown-based white stem, well-being courts and playgrounds that Howard Miller cares for, although he can hardly write and read.”
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn sells all kinds of drinks and everything that might be necessary for temporary accommodations.
In a few hundred words, Hurston has linked Eatonville to autonomy, but also to inconsciousness, remarried, and sex.
It is clear that the Fodor's passport introduced it differently.
This description really didn’t like everyone.
"Zora said things as they were," said Ella Dinkins, a 90-year-old girl, Johnson, made them immortal by quoting the songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered as the first specialist who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville in Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived in a stunning Chevrolet, cigarettes, and in a long pants to a city where people are still proud of their dignity.
Most people were charming, said Franklin, but many of them were charming.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
However, in the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added in his chair, "No longer stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer released.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with most of the world, had forgotten it.
Although he was ever a popular writer, Langston Hughes, and the only black woman in the Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in the Florida Fort Pierce where he lived before.
There were no significant mentions in Eatonville or large public readings.
"I don't think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, the author of Hurston's biograph, published in 2003, the book "Hurston buryed into the Squad".
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-way road through the city instead of the two-way main street, the Kennedy radiation, which played an important role in the community's lives.
The expanding Orland has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorways connected to the states on the west side of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still on foot after a difficult history period.
Among other things, forced integration has ended the Community’s relatively idyllic isolation.
In the 1950s, the wars on racial mixing have tasted hate with the community.
"A lot of white boys came over and thrown the oranges and other things on the side of the road," Franklin said.
"There was a woman who died in it.
They threw a Greek medal out of a car."
In a letter written in 1955 by the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court for violent integration. So he said of the decision called "Brown v. Board of Education": "he violates my race more and not respects my race."
Today, residents say that desegregation of schools was positive in some respects, weakened the concentration of eatonvilles and undermined the self-confidence of young people.
"The black children used to kill them - that I remember - the man hugged his teacher in the morning and evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter Ella Dinkins, CEO of the non-profit organization called Meg Eatonville.
“It took until the students and teachers came from a common place,” he said.
"We didn't embrace our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us," Nathiri said.
However, human rights helped to raise many other Zora Neale Hurston - in black writers, actresses and artists who have risen up in prejudices, as he did, with a strong self-confidence and lines as follows: "How can anyone deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company?
That's incomprehensible for me."
In 1975, Alice Walker strangled Hurston's insignificant grave and began to fight to give his reputation back.
Five years later, the bookstore shelves were placed in a well-known Hurston biography written by Robert E. Hemenway, which was reintroduced among American examples.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville’s most famous daughter returned to the focus of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbours looked at him as a savior.
In 1988, the community began to organize a Hurston festival to show what would destroy the county’s main path.
Thousands of fans have arrived for the opening event two years later, and many have since returned to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the county stopped its road construction proposal.
"Because of the five-distance of the main road, the community revived, connected to full speed, which means real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped change the image of the city itself.
There was an increasing number of people outside the city, such as attorney Rachelle Munson, who began to visit the church in 1993, and the locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the National Historical List in 1998.
In 2006, the new, uniform (naturally known as Hurston) library was opened on the repacked and decorated Kennedy radius.
Eatonville remains Florida's cakehouse: it is not just ten km away from Orlando's center, but sometimes it feels like a city sideway during the summer rain; it is as small as when the 27 black families founded in the 1880s.
(90% of people are black today.)
They still take care of outsiders who come here looking for Eatonville's story.
For most interviews, a prior authorisation is required, and a few things, such as the oldest fresco of Eatonville, which a white man painted and black people working on the grounds, should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, including a self-confident Jones, who are particularly attracted to the vibrant red, are afraid of misunderstanding their separate community.
And yet, as the Hurston festival became increasingly broader, the pride of the hometown grew.
In particular, young people are increasingly viewed as Eatonville, as Hurston saw his own species: wonderful, problems, and with everything, they are better, worse, as proud, creative, foolish, and disturbed as other race and ethnic groups in America.
The 18-year-old Edwin Harvey's cousin Franklin, who plans to return to the local government or police after the college, to work that he thinks they need help.
And it seems that younger people also learned to characterize Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just travel here think this city is nothing compared to the rest," said Alondra Kenon recently after the worship of God on Sunday.
“But if someone stops and takes a little time to know his history, it’s a very nice city.”
We all speak the language of finances in New York
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If the tourists didn't care about the journalists and the huge TVs on Times Square, I wouldn't notice they're in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that bankers and risk fund managers with glass-wall, bee-shaped offices over their heads, who have kept New York in power, have lived the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers are still going through their metal tea trucks on the walks, shipping trays with muffins for breakfast meetings.
Still, men with Spanish lips whisper amongst the cable houses, carrying fifty-fifty breeze shirts hanging on the shoulders, like a sleeve.
Office employees are still in line for their breakfast sweet bakery in the car park, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 on the ordinary afternoon.
I didn’t feel that there would be any crisis until I opened a new bank account on Thursday afternoon.
I was deliberately planning to take care of it in my JP Morgan Chase bank’s local account during the afternoon’s rest, but there were about 20 people in front of me.
Not at the banker's window where money can be purchased or paid, but at the customer service counter where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's store, and where new customers open a bank account.
A lot of people in front of me - I later found out from Starr, the banker who ordered me - they were in line with the same intention as me.
However, unlike me, they have already taken money from smaller banks in their homeplace, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from the so-called margins (such as housing-building cooperatives), credit cooperatives, and small-town savings funds that operate in only one state and allegedly treat their customers as a family member.
In the past year, 15 such banks have been ruined in silence.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion capital has been bankruptcy, and when the New Yorks went home on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, a savings buyer earning $440 billion.
The office and store employees ahead of me, feared of a new collapse, took their money into a bank that seemed to be a safe shelter, to the bank that purchases most capital injections on Wall Street.
In the past few weeks, people in New York have become experts in finances.
A woman in the local Chinese store said on her phone that she went into bankruptcy from Lehman Brothers bank and her huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, was complaining about a lazy colleague.
Lyn, my apartment's homemade uniform, fifty years old, has changed the subject of care, and we are not talking about Brad and Angelina, or my food delivery as we do.
He said to me after I went to the bank: "I invested all my savings in cash market assets.
I changed, you didn't risk."
Muslim tombs were mocked while Austria was on the right side
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the Austrian Freedom Party on the right hand, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian Right-wing Party, Vlaams Belang, participated in an advocacy in Antwerpen on 17 January 2008, which was presented by the organization "Warners against Islam Control".
There were signs of transporting boards that were embedded with a red line-drawn mosque.
According to the police, extreme-right extremists are responsible for the deterioration of Austrian Muslim Cemeteries, which took place on the same weekend when the extremist parties made significant progress in national parliamentary elections.
There were more than 90 tombs in the trauni cemetery next to Linz, someday Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators painted Jewish symbols, such as David stars, were drawing on a few graves, but the detectives said they were trying to hide their extreme motives from the hatred of immigrants in Muslim.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked to elections in some way.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said that they were “deeply furnished” at the hearing of the tombs, which happened shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month, Ramadán.
At the same time, Austria is conducting a conscience assessment after yesterday's parliamentary elections, in which the language of political balance is right.
The two extreme right parties, which received almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the future of the Freedom Party and the Federal Austria, for a strong anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were stamped as foreign haters.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Freedom Party of more than 18% of the votes, expressed the campaign against headbands and bubbles, and expressed its disgust to the foods that were supposed to be linked to the Islam.
At the final meeting of the party, the party spoke of "European Brotherhood", which helps prevent Islam from strengthening.
Both parties want to protest the construction of their mosques and mines by arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamicism of Austria and Europe.
According to public opinion research and analysis carried out directly after the election of the best-between wins, the change was largely due to the young voting base who were concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter was banned from a foreign trip
Garry Glitter, convicted of rape of children, was a known rock star, forbidden by the court from travelling in France and Spain.
The judges then decided to ban Glitter for six months to inform the control authorities of their intention to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent Police received a ban on the trip on Thursday after submitting evidence to the court on the judgments on gender violence against children against Glitter.
Glitter, named Paul Gadd, was not involved in the trial of Kent Ashford Magistrates, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesman said: “On 25 September, on Thursday, the Kent Police submitted an application to the Ashford Magistrates Court for preventing Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up personally."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of its foreign travel intentions because it is required by the law on the persons involved in the register of sexual offences.
It must inform the authorities if they intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You must also notify the police at least seven days before the planned departure.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to a loss of freedom for five years.
The Kent Police said they don't want to talk about the unique cases in Glitter County and their possible location.
The Kent Police spokesman said: “The Kent Police will do everything to protect children in the country and abroad.
“We believe that it is easier to check someone if you do not leave the UK because there is a comprehensive system for us to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The main task of the Kent Police is to protect the population of Kent. Through close cooperation, we constantly monitor the behavior of persons in the register of sexual offences and in the county to minimize the potential risks of the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10 and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he should have gone to a London plane.
However, he claimed that he was feeling bad and he refused to fly to London.
The landscape authorities did not pass the passport investigation, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities were also not allowed to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where the officials of the rural police and the Immigration Office insisted on returning to Great Britain.
Finally, on August 22, he arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 and remained there until his lawyer David Corker went to the West London Court, uxbridge, as Scotland Yard was asked to register sexual offences under a court order.
Glitter spent four months in prison for the possession of photos of child violence in the United Kingdom in 1999.
According to a source of the Ministry of Interior, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for the Interior, welcomed Glitter’s failure to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take pictures on the stage because I want to introduce the artist from the personal page" Günther Bauer Photographer
No decorations, no haircuts, no dance shoes.
Flamenco’s great masters from the heart, without the excitement of the action: to get to know the dancers’ ordinary faces.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And these two pages cannot be separated, except in the moments away from the inside audience, when we can get a personal move, we can capture the depth of a caught look, or we can admire the beauty of the artist who is making the action of the unspeakable, but rather explicit hand.
In the German Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, the theatre of singers, dancers and guitarists combines the theatre of the masters with these less known ordinary sites.
Through the photos, flamenco’s specific iconography is presented from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the increasing international significance of the flamenco day by day," believes the author, adding that the Flamenco-people could be "the character of anyone, as the images are seen by the observer in the shock that these images are not typically depicted by the artists.
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and take the audience.
However, stage photography is not suitable to capture their personality.
Their personality and character are in the deepest place.
I wanted to create an inner atmosphere that allows me to inherit the personality of the greats of the flamenco with the help of the camera."
The Cante de las Minas festival in 1997 led Bauer to his long journey, in which he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitars and dancers.
These portraits, thanks to the camera and the choice of the subject, quote classic photography.
However, the use of different stylistical tools breaks the traditional image representation and suggests modernity. The following reflects faithfully Bauer's vision of the flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, which, however, turns from day to day, and always impressive."
Not dancing, not singing or music alone, rather the artist's personality, character magic of the audience.
In the days of the El Photomata gallery, the leading motivation of works is the search for an encounter with the essence, the artistic magic, which becomes visible through sensation, existence, and appearance.
The known figures of the flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, show this sixty artists.
The project has also become a flamenco-antology, which will soon be released by an album for portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits has been scratched for two years to repeat the idea with the series "Veteran athletes portraits" (SportART project).
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is a bit different from that, the photographer adds: "I love to photograph people, to get to know them and to enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the hardest genre of photography is the portrait.
You meet people who sometimes don’t know or who only take a few minutes to photograph.
Despite these circumstances, I am always trying to realise my ideas as a photographer.
The exhibition with the Flamenco-people address, selected from contemporary flamenco portraits, is held in the El Photomata Gallery, which is located in the Alameda de Hércules by 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says the novel to work on "prepared blindness"
The scene and the act are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also tired of writing his new novel. The novel’s main character was an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who lived 20 years in Congo and Amazonia.
The author at the Hay Festival Segovia event also admitted that his current work was "prepared blindness" and "all signs indicate that it should not be written" the novel.
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and hope I can do it sometime," he closed his lecture with these words at the festival of ideas, thought and opinion exchanges, which received hundreds of writers, historians and journalists in the city of Aqueduct for four days, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of "City and Dogs" was one of the most outstanding participants in the literature celebration, and he added hopes.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Middle Friend".
After the greeting of Félix Romeo, a devoted audience welcomed. The celebration of the audience quickly shrinked, during which the author of Peru told me with a fantastic memorial ability and a large amount of humor, how he developed from the special adventure of his reading passion and the desire to live life; how he overcomes the inspiratory deficiency with disciplined writing methods, busy documentation, many repairs and rewriting; how he influenced his authors Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and how his stories are built.
The Latin American novel recognized that it is impossible to measure or demonstrate whether books change our lives, but he added: “I don’t think that literature is merely fun or tizavir-life experience,” because it has an impact on people and motivates them to think, so he asked the writers, do not allow them to seduce tears and bear their responsibility for their profession.
Because of the weather, Pozoblanco's farewell is shorter, the horsemen's bicaviadals are missing.
The traditionally organized horse bicaviadal in Pozoblanco’s holidays was erased from the show yesterday morning after the future horses were found inappropriate on the field of the arena.
As a result, the Committee agreed with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to miss the bikavia.
Weather contradictions dramatically decorated the celebration series, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the rain was left with the second buffet.
The future major players, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castilblancó would have fought with biques.
So they only held a bique on Friday.
Daniel Luque became a winner, brought three ears home as a trophy.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante’s two bulls received a ear as many awards and trophies, but it was more due to the audience than to his own performance.
However, El Juli followed, who contributed little to the aging of the reputation of Los Llanos arena.
After the second bike, most of the audiences were able to get out of the row.
In sleep, a two tons of abdominal van tried to escape from road control
Four o'clock in the morning, fifty minutes.
Bask District Police conducts traffic control in Armiñón (Álava) administrative area.
The authority stops a van in which two travel. Passengers try to escape from the measure.
The shipment is more than two tons of abdomen, but it was not noticeable.
The detectives persecuted passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A.J., said the Basque Department of Interior.
The arrested man is accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting.
The case took place in the administrative area of Armiñón, where employees of the Hungarian Revolutionary Authority carried out traffic control on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the control site.
The detectives took him to jail, then the vehicle stopped a few kilometres from the station, and his passengers escaped from the motorway to a forest area.
Basque Regional Police finally arrested one of them and after reviewing the Iveco Daily brand van, he booked its shipment of 2178 kilograms of hasis.
Hairy beans filling the back part of the vehicle were forced by the police to investigate the drug more thoroughly and to measure the drug.
In addition, during the inspection, it has been demonstrated that the vehicle’s false registration plate does not match the information contained in the van’s papers, and that is why the arrested person is also subject to a procedure due to the fake of a public document.
The Basque Regional Police continues the investigation, which aims at arresting the other suspect, who, as mentioned above, escaped the motorway, on the other hand to determine the origin of the drug booked.
The 28-year-old accused A. A. J. was sent to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and the court measures began within a few hours.
He was arrested by actress Heather Locklear because he was driven under the influence of the drug
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by the police in Santa Barbara (California), because he led under the influence of the drug.
According to a witness, he tried to leave the parking in Montecito with strange manoeuvres - a spokesman of the People's magazine in California.
According to the witness, at 16:00, Locklear pushed the gas to the basement, blew the engine, tried to leave the parking room in front and backwards, and went through the sunglasses several times in the back.
Shortly later, the witness who probably didn’t recognize the actress first saw Locklear stopping on a nearby motorway and leaving the car.
He also called the police because he was worried about Locklear's life.
When the police arrived, the actress sat in his car, which partially paralyzed the road traffic.
"It seemed like Zavart," so the patrolers took him to a specialized centre for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was co-operative and alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded. The spokesman also said that, on the basis of the first impression of the officers, it was considered that Locklear was under the influence of the drug.
Lockleart was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug.
Locklear came out two months ago from an arizonan sanatory where his anxiety and depression were treated.
Llamazares calls on the IU (United Left) andaluúz Federation to take care of the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary General of the IU and representative of the United Left today stated that the regional federation of the Faculty will decide on the case of the Seville Municipality and Sports Advisor Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva renounced last week after accused of misleading her position to bring her family members to advantages.
"In these things, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this case is certainly the responsibility of the Andaluz organization," Llamazares pointed out the procedure to be applied by the party against the former member of the City Council in Seville.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that in the discovery of irregularities that Silva may have committed, it should be borne in mind: "The IU has always taken a plane in addition to the maximum transparency of such cases."
He added that it was part of the training "the strict ethical code for public applications."
"Mad Blood", Garci's epic formation
Benito Pérez Galdos National Episodes inspired José Luis Garci, who reiterates the famous anti-French rise in the Majusi blood, which, with almost €15 million budgets, is the greatest form of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the human flow and social analysis by him in his well-known novel’s work. All this was said to Garci in the show Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
The more than two and a half-hour Majusi blood will be presented in the movies on Friday, and later Telemadrid will show it as a mini series of more than four hours.
The great admirer of José Luis Garci, Galdós’ literature, made his childhood dream with this translate. All this thanks to Esperanza Aguirrre, because he trusted Madrid's territory three years ago to create a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of Madrid's May 2th anniversary. Garci accepted the request with this condition if the foundation of the story could be given by the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget was fully financed by the Madrid Autonomous Province, and it was a special opportunity for Garci: he could show it with a decoration and a sign "the disrupted Spanishs who joined the wrong leader of error, because he pushed the country into a huge failure to fight for independence", said Ferdinand VII.
However, the director expressed his regret that he could not count with the budget of Alatriste or Goya, who kicked the Majusi blood over double. It was necessary to skip a few scenes from the scenario, which were recorded together with Horacio Valcárcell, as many other occasions.
So, the director of the Re-start took the scenes with those actresses who started the experiments before the shooting. Casting was not, because Garci considered it "comfortable" and, as he said, "the director's mastery is part of the theatre and the cinema to find out what is going on in the industry we work in."
More actors in the Majusi blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not first enter their camera.
Garci, who boasts four Oscar marks and an Oscar award, believes that this is the candidate of Spain before the Hollywood Academy, namely the Majusi blood, the seven French biliards and none of the lately elected Vak sunflowers, represents the young generation of Spanish cinema, "where it should be presented", said.
Garci’s film doesn’t count on fees.
"You think you're working for the afterlife, and then you'll find out that only happiness matters, and you'll be happy to have another movie done," Garci says with 30 years of professional career behind his back.
Isabel Bayon recalls the life and art of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer in Seville is also a dancer in Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in the Triana district and moved to London with three-year-old parents from the Catalan Father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andaluz mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela).
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern Dancing.
During his busy life he fought as a pioneer for female equality, either Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against the wear of a spice that prevented women's freedom of movement.
The Dancing and Aesthetic Revolution exploded in the war in Europe, his life clashed Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gambo, and he gave me attention to Tórtola whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: “It’s not our goal to tell the story of life, but to capture his soul.
The titles of his dances came from flamenco styles.
For example, the dance of the "snake dance" of the guaji, or the "snake dance" is the tango.
"He danced in a sense, and others say it is my style," he says.
The light of the lecture is raised by two extraordinary advocates: Miguel Poveda sings again after the Open Door; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, wanted to work with a former disciple.
"Matilde makes the older Tórtola, the mature woman.
I'm glad he said yes to the request, it's very honoring to play in my piece."
In addition, Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga music directors and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón singers; El Pajaro hits, Rafa El Viola brücket, and Juanfr Juárez, who plays "the constant character with his love."
The piece also shows the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and then even reaches remote landscapes, including India, the United States or Italy.
“I wanted to remind him because his personality had a great impact on his own age, but they don’t know and value his work even less,” says Bayon.
The show begins at 20:00 this evening at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of Triennium, the "A Recently Wedded Poet's Day" also appears.
The first illustrated edition of a newly married poet's journal will be in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation will be part of the programme series titled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008), organised by the Andalúz Regional Culture Committee on the Fifth Anniversary Nobel Prize and the Death of the Two Years.
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the final edition of this work, the International Congress held in New York, the restaurisation of the Nobel Prize poetry monument and the "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The bright summer tree" exhibition. The exhibition opened in May this year, several Andaluz Provinces opened and went to New York at the time of the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalúz Region has gained eight hundred copies of the journal of a newly married poet named Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso to promote the reputation and work of one of the most populous Andalúz poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
"God sometimes produces perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that."
The quote comes from an actress Sally Field who worked with Newman in a film of the victims of Sensation and reflects the shock and inevitability caused by Newman's death in the American cinema and all over America.
How hard it was to get Oscar.
revoked in 2007,
and he was well-knownly ill,
But he still organized everyone's death.
"Sometimes it is impossible to express our feelings and I have lost a good friend," Robert Redford said, "he has made life better and this country better."
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or overcrowding.
One of the heroes of the cinema and home took place in a particularly dark period, which was shaken by the fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When such difficult times walk and many easily lose virtues and there are very few people we can look up to, we don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of people, he has physicalized the idea of beauty and justice.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and a protector of lost and winned matters, starting from the anti-drug foundation created in the memory of the first-born son who died in drug extinction to the creation of a home-like bionutrition factory.
It was a real gift for a country that was difficult to overcome its self-suicide diet culture.
The stunning admiration wave went to Hollywood without regard to nationalities and origin.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, said it wasn't a man, but a age died with him.
Another English, Oscar awarder Sam Mendes said that his work with Newmann was clearly the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, a bad boy from Australia, called Newman directly the largest inspirer.
“He made the lens very high for all of us,” George Clooney said, perhaps one of the few who are attempting to follow Paul Newman’s lifestyle today, demanding honesty and private life away from serious and cameras.
It’s not always easy if it’s even possible in the midst of today’s media jungle.
But there are people who try and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once, but then he lived faithfully with Joanne Woodward for fifty years, and he would certainly have had many opportunities for unfaithfulness.
"Why are they eating hamburgers somewhere else if the meat is at home?" he was joking.
In heaven, you may be proud to have a fan of the daughters on earth, which is not so common in America.
“One of all his designs was not as proud as the faithful husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and the devoted man-friendly role,” he says.
The rude way to the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dreams of a Madrid Olympics, and after 2012 failed, it might become 2016.
But, I'm asking if we're really ready for it?
Because if we're off the race yesterday, I don't think so.
It was called a perfect race, but I see it was the worst of many of what I've ever been.
It was characterized by the complexity of insignificantities, and if it were to be evaluated once, and I would be the exam, the result would be clearly devastated.
Let's go in line and start at the beginning.
The insignificantities began to receive the number, because they had to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go faster, at least get everything at the same time (including the chip, avoid the position in the later line).
Well, that's not what happened.
First of all, the line number was given only (the first meaninglessness, only to go there sooner) and (after the usual position), as surprising, only S-shirt (the second meaninglessness, because I have a XL size)!
What world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, they decided to save the material and only buy cheaper, small T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still broken from the day of the race.
In addition to the terrible early time to take the chip, the position in line lasted 15 minutes from arrival, and even the backpack had to be handed down.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race with over 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race began, and we haven't given down the backpack yet, and when it was finally done, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain has made more pleasant than 40 minutes of waiting, which was designed by attempts to rise and stand-in.
I think we will receive about 500 certain lung infections tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, are not getting our placement at our actual time, as I assume my chip failed to confirm the departure.
If they asked me about the perfect race, it wouldn't accidentally come to mind.
So I think we can continue dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft (virtual) reception
At the MIT Initiative Technologies Conference, Microsoft presented a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence that is capable of performing some basic tasks. For example, he can call a taxi (or a vehicle transporting in the company) based on the information heard from the conversation.
This "receptive" is a camera and a form and face recognition system allows you to recognize how many people in the room are, who they - in fact, note what clothes they wear - as well as hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group the presents on the basis of discussions.
On the show video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but he knows that he is not part of the company that talks to him and is not the employee of the company.
She asks if she came to visit someone and ensures that she will be in a hurry to help her soon.
All of this without the blue screen.
It's impressive.
This is, of course, the music of the future.
At the moment, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, many people have said that Microsoft has changed the strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contains fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if the computers were running only the necessary programs instead of a lot of commercial eyes, the machines would be five times faster - Bravo, Steve, this is something.
The Spanish message has been invented, given that Microsoft has connected additional functions and extremists to Windows in all new versions.
The change of direction is reversed.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly needed, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I also joined the theory that Google took the first step to become a Windows competitor.
Many have rightly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is an essential element for the hardware and software dialogue.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to tell his mother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it will need to be counted by the "death" of the operating system, not absolute, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer’s statement this week underlines this thought.
People get less and less attention to the operating system and more and more on the web browser.
The computer is only switched on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more time to browse than the time we spend in the world of windows.
What is most of the applications associated with the system?
Less sometimes more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less depressed, less complicated.
Microsoft aims to integrate its services on-line and eventually represent an alternative to Google.
All they need is an example of why.
I made this photo at the beginning of the month in a discussion for Microsoft apps in Redmond.
On the sofa machine, a poster calls them to use the company's browser.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft workers used Google to browse online.
The new version of Windows Mobile 7 has also been reported last week.
Not in the beginning of 2009, but in the end, even in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to throw Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 on a joint market.
After all, the mobile phone is increasingly operating as a computer.
But the sliding, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will certainly ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This was used by Pablo Picasso in the Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola, and also by one of the founding gay customers.
And if we're already on the list of specialities, we can even recall the peace figure of the stew of the wandering circus.
But what are we talking about?
I mean, the "train", as the English lips are called, but no competitors with Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete with.
First of all, because of the elegant name, although friends only mention it as "Marcel", which is due to sports, legend said Marcel Cerdan was named by the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel’s excellent cotton material, unisex customization, special emblem and small (also recognizable) Belgian flag also appears from its competitors. This is the most characteristic models hidden in the neck of the T-shirt.
But the Belgian company does not just make tank tops.
Athletes, retro boxers, kashmir cardigans, wool pants, seafoots, babes, mini series - and we could still be classified - are all of the company's products.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
Although it is also unfortunate that they should be weared as a underwear.
They're too good for that.
“I would love to be a young mother; no matter who the father will be.”
It is very similar to your brother, but it has succeeded in achieving itself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but it's full of energy.
At the moment, Cruz's sisters want to play a more serious role in the world of fashion.
For Monica, modeling means much more than some pretty and beautiful girls give their name to something.
He was present in the promotion of the new Paris headquarters of Mango and the most strongly sponsored fashion prizes sponsored by the Spanish company.
Hotness and gentleness are flowing from it.
What are you doing in Paris?
We present Mango's new autumn-winning collection, which we have planned with my brother Penélopa. We also participate in the publication of the second "Mango Fashion Awards" proposal and the galavant of Valentino in the Opera.
It's a dense day, it's true, but it's exciting.
This is your fourth season at the Mango company.
We both love the movies of the 50s and 60s; we have taken a lot of it.
And then, often I just walk into the city and look at women, dressing, changing and choosing their clothes - this is my favorite time.
You also work as a dancer, an actress, and a fashion designer.
I think, too, but in the end, these three things are related, because there are a lot of common points in them.
When I was young, the clothes were interested, I was hardly expecting to go to my grandmother and go to my aunt's closets.
Well, that was you, the Canaan, almost got up with a fun couple.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to watch my dress.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for hours and trials to feel good when we look into the mirror.
In the role of the actress, you are truly identical to your role when you get the costume.
You see, it's all connected to everything, and all my respects are the designers and expertise.
Have you recently celebrated your 30th birthday?
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think that women are really worth it, they have already experienced enough, and there are fewer mistakes in life.
Biological clock does not worry.
Since my childhood, I've done what I want to do, and it's filled with great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I'm born like this as a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss it.
As for the future father, no matter who it will be.
I would like to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movies last year, and you've been filming more movies that they haven't even introduced.
Yeah, and I can't wait for you to come out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and restless, want everything right away, but I know that's impossible.
I can't wait to show you the last hour and the search for the grave of Christ.
I wonder what you're saying to them...
I know you've been debating Naomi Campbell on the runway a few days ago.
Well, no, that's not true.
I didn't go to the runner as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and he's just invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which was ordered for the benefit of his own women's organization for a better world. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The clothes presented were sold and the amount was offered to Naomi's NGO.
People don't even know how good-hearted Naomi is.
I know so much about it, and I can make sure half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look at the right side of your activity.
He asked me to play the fashion show for a noble case, but if he wanted me to stand on the head, I'll do that.
If women in the third world are destined to bet, I don’t know impossible.
Recessive drink drivers will be required to install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior would require a vehicle to install a structure that would prevent the start of the vehicle when the driver is in a drink condition or does not blow into the structure.
The proposal was submitted in June and is currently dealt with by the Public Prosecutor’s Office that the pilot project will take one year.
Since the project is intended to be re-marketed, the driver will also have to participate in a repeated course of transport education.
In addition to the General Public Prosecutor of Transport Security, the DGT and the Foundation of the Auto Safety Technology Institute (FITSA) are also involved in the experiment.
According to the statistics, 30-75% of the cars arrested for drinking cars are in the car again.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air inflated. If it is higher than the permitted, or if the driver did not blow into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of an instrument of more than 1000 euros would be the charge of an infringer.
A 2007 study on this in the United States has shown that vehicles equipped with such instruments can reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year of installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could save their lives every year.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent crime from becoming a crime.
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce, as the implementation of the legal reform will take place in the usual framework, while the necessary criminal reform would require a fundamental amendment to the law.
The instrument is not available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although in experimental mode it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
The House will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Work Party, which, in French pattern, urges the system to be installed in school buses.
In Mexico, closed shoes
With English accuracy, at the time published in the program, the Spanish Air Force was landed at 17:00 40 minutes in the Presidential Sound of Benito Juárez airport in Mexico.
The day was already down, but it was so fired that only when we used our hands as an eyewitness, we saw the royal party leaving the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other ranked personalities were standing.
A few hours before I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew he was coming to the city for an official visit by the Spanish Princess.
Well, that's great, then, for a while, there's no airport transfer... the woman's here or something like that...
- No, sir, the lady in Spanish, he just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or maybe...
But the Mexican press, then he knows everything about the Asturiasi Princess Party and the importance of their visit.
Many people are waiting for the red carpet of the airport tone, made by the 27 marine soldiers, who provide the protection of dignity.
They appear in the princess, smiling, sea blue clothes, and then the princess, in the long hair of the wind, in the backed dress, but not in the ordinary, toes flashing shoes, they may have warned that a storm threatens Mexico City.
They stop and smile to the cameras for a moment, then enter the room where the official bet is followed.
In the gate of their hotel - one of the four largest hotels in the city - one of the mexican television's newsletters is waiting for them.
The most valuable fashion prize
The best place in the world for the transfer of a fashion prize is definitely Paris, and the most sophisticated and most powerful of today's fashion designers is Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second invitation to the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims at international knowledge of the young talents of the fashion profession.
The main prize is EUR 300,000.
Last night, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first application, saw his own design clothes in the exhibition of Haussmann, under 54 in Paris, and at a small slight ease from the impact.
Besides, this is the second largest European business of the company and recently opened in 1335 square meters.
The largest business is located in London.
We finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner in the Paris Garnier Opera, the event of the medals and Valentino, in the midst of the thanksgiving of the jury.
In the best Chagals, the presidency table made by Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, who’s brother, who’s recently died, came with a heavy heart and sadness, wore one of the company’s pieces and some of ELAH’s breathtaking charms.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango had fun with the guests. At the same time, Bar Rotchil was so ridicule that they were finally left without a suit because they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in his own design pants and shirt and wore a sexy long black dress at the dinner. During his night opera shopping, Gaya Toledo was so busy in the ballet room that he had brought back the old times to one of the rods and a grand plie kind.
Inés Sastre did not participate in the palace visit, but before he showed some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning in Oliver Martinez, we were delighted - he will be two metres tall and drive a motor - and John Travolta arrived at the Paris Intercontinent hotel. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he said in good advance that he wouldn’t ask for any smelling in the room.
Stars under the sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress number
Not 1000, but 1,000 and one way to turn off from the chaotic and confusing ordinary days.
More good news is that we can find them in a single book that arrives in the bookstore store on 30 September to bring peace with you.
It is almost torturen by clock clocks at 7:00 in the morning, but even worse to think about how fast the world is forced to live every day.
The office's name is tension and the computer's back pain.
Stress is the genocide of the 21st century.
But it is not one and not two ways to overcome daily fatigue and to overcome job problems.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to the yoga positions, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in his book so that everyone can find a solution to the most favourable and free moments.
The stressful work bears the address of the 1001 relaxation method and the rest of it comes from Pearson Alhambra y DK publisher to the bookstore stores.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly incur in your faith.
In addition, it also serves other ideas that help relaxation, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to prepare natural foods to 100%.
If you have become too low to refresh your adrenaline level and become a central problem in your life of stress, it is time to retire, relax and only focus on reading.
Those who speak in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t think of those who are shaking up and completely alert about what happened to them that day, but about those who talk to them during sleep.
The phenomenon may first seem scary, but in fact it is completely harmless.
This good-minded sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure you've told some of them that he spoke at night.
With regard to its frequency, it can be completely rapsodic (e.g. only once in a disease with high fever), or more regular (one day, once a week or month), and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
The appearance cannot be restored for a single trigger cause.
Often other sleeping disorders, such as nightmares, nightrises, nightclubs (enuresis nocturna) or sleeping, are associated with sleeping, but this is not legal.
As we have already mentioned, the condition with high fever may be accompanied by stress or increased excitement.
However, it has been little studied so far.
The intensity of the speech is also very changing.
It may be quiet, calm, and may be inconsistent words, morming, but in contrast to all these, it may also occur in the form of shouting, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and the professional. The study can reveal whether there is no problem in the background that causes a great anxiety and can also offer a solution.
As has already been mentioned, there is no cure, as a result, unless it is associated with another form of sleep disorder, such as insomnia or stress.
However, we can do a few things, here is a shock prevention measure:
Be careful to keep your child calm before sleeping.
Let’s choose relaxing games and avoid watching a child with fearful or more aggressive TV shows or series.
For children who are nervous or more relaxed, we teach some relaxation methods to easily find their inner calm.
This helps the child to sleep more calmly.
If you start talking while you sleep, let's try to keep our calm.
Remember, this is harmless for the child, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Useful advice
Don't wake the child up.
It would be impossible because the child has no consciousness, but he would rush out of sleep.
Despite talking, he actually sleeps and rests.
Remember, if you are often accompanied by a strong anxiety, it is recommended to turn to a specialist or discover what triggers a high degree of anxiety from the child.
If you speak clearly (this rarest case), do not start asking you to know anything about it.
It would be unnecessary, because during sleep it isn't so conscious to gather your thoughts.
On the other hand, you only hear the speech, but you do not see the dreams associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of the hearings and possible conclusions.
Never tell the child they can ask about his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
This is a great anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, it's just a few minutes of harmless episodes.
Finally, Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, Illhaeusern’s team finally gained a new boost and rewinded on the domestic course.
Although there was no gentle match, the yellow blacks were put in a position several times, one of which they were finally able to win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, because the attackers had hard to feel the right rhythm.
The first gate shot was the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the remote ball was just affected by the top corner of the gate. Then Illhaeusern got in charge and followed the shots: Fonderflick tried a remote shot, and then Hirn shot up the gate. Romain spickkel and Diebold also tried to try to protect Dannemarie.
On the other hand, players were protected in a block sealed on the middle track, and only the eternal mover Riahi was shot.
The beginning of the second semester promised to be crucial: first Riahi and Temporale were placed on the Dannemarie side. Soon after the first goal: after the first shot of Diebold, the ball was released by illhaeuserni Marais, and then the gate gave it (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern's goalmaster couldn't enjoy glory for a long time: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the track, so his teammates had to continue their struggle in human strength.
Dannemarie, however, couldn’t take advantage of its advantage: they didn’t have many problems with the domestic team, who just a little bit backed up to strengthen their defenses. Only the last seconds kept some excitement when the ball came very close to the gate.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy puts an excursion to Bretagne.
On Monday, the demonstration held by fishermen paralyzed the traffic of several ports of Breton and Norman. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Finistère, Le Guilvinec, on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised that the President would be accepted in a "constructional spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with "concrete proposals".
The presidential visit is currently coinciding with the meeting of the Crisis Committee, created by breton fishermen with the aim of taking action against the increase in the price of gas oil, as the oil price exceeded the average price of the 1,14 euros record per litre.
David Martinon, spokesman of the Republic, said that the President will “debate with fishermen what solutions could help companies to recover their competitiveness and make the seafarers more secure and secure.”
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to arrive.
On Tuesday morning, there were traffic slowing demonstrations in Morbihan and Calvados county, which led to nearly 10 km long distortions.
The traffic of Quiberon's yacht site was also paralyzed, but the roads towards Belle-île were not closed.
The Quiberon peninsula was placed on roadsides.
On Monday, the seafarers have already witnessed their determination. In the morning, tyres and pallets were fired before the fuel storage of the Brest ports while protests took place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic Coast and La Manche. For example, in the Vendée county Sables d'Olonne, the fishermen did not board a ship, while in Le Havre, about twenty ships hindered the traffic of commercial ships.
During the evening, the fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique county were eliminated by the huge total oil-refining block in Donges.
However, Boulogne-sur-Mer fishermen decided to wait for a Wednesday meeting in the Ministry with a decision on further steps.
Le Guilvinec must decide on Tuesday on its next step and participation at the meeting scheduled by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the Heads of the National Fisheries Committee, as the Committee did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues," said Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Committee on Fishing.
Vocational fishermen who do not pay taxes after gas oil are currently paying about 50 cents for liters, but believe that the operation of a ship would become profitable only if the price of gas oil would fall below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The Beautiful Paul Newman
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" forgotten addressees at connecticuti's home at the age of 83 due to death, cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes, were honored by the actress Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer does not change its 2008 transport plans
Despite the crisis that threatens the world economy, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is planning to land 215 aircraft this year.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer company, Embraer, can keep the plans and plan to land 215 aircraft in 2008, Fredrico Fleury Curado, President of the company, confirmed.
In the first semester, the company shipped 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian producer company is largely involved in the Chinese market, especially with regard to 30-120 airplanes.
In eight years, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, which has been restored by the US financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets to pay back $85 billion pre-received for it, announced the dominant edition of Financial Times.
In addition to the international level of life insurance and American pension insurance activities, AIG would choose from a large part of almost any other business - the newspaper, which called on sources that are close to the case.
According to Times, the Board of Directors of AIG came together on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of sales.
The AIG did not confirm this information.
The assets that AIG intends to sell include the company’s International Lease Financial Corp, the 59% share of Transatlantic Holdings in the reinsurer company, and its property portfolio and private capital investments, are added by Times.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on sales.
AIG must quickly access liquid assets to repay the 85 billion dollar loan approved by the US Government, thus creating the risk that it will have to switch from 80% of its capital and lose its shareholders in an appropriate proportion.
The Paris Historique study of the historic Morning Meeting meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historical decline on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson Banking Plan. The Dow Jones Index fell by 6.98% (which never saw a decrease of nearly 800 points) and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA) went down with 777.68 points, thus closing at 10 365.45 points.
The biggest decline in the index (684.81 accuracy) was registered on September 17, 2001, when the trade began again after the 11 September terrorist attack.
Nasdaq, mainly based on technology papers, was closed at 1 983,73 points, while Standard &amp; Poor's 500 expanded index decreased to 1 106.55 points according to official closure data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was weakened at the opening, and then the Senate unexpectedly rejected the banking rescue plan to restore the market balance, began to fly deep.
Members rejected 228 "no" votes against 205 "yes" the funding requested by Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance.
Nearly two-thirds of Republicans voted the plan.
“The market has shown bad signs because Congress seems to be unable to approve a plan,” Lindsey Piegza, the FTN Financial Analyst.
“It also seems how much the market expected this plan,” she added, and then expressed her concern that if a few days later they would accept such a plan, it would be too late.
"If the plan is actually condemned to death (...), then on Fed (American central bank - the agent) and on other central banks will be the order to deal with the crisis and the credit conditions will continue to tighten up," Brian Bethune, CEO of Global Insight.
Piegza added: “A new and new financial institution goes into bankruptcy every day” in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual Friday, the authorities ensured that Wachovia’s banking branches were purchased by its rival, Citigroup.
The crisis has suddenly accelerated in Europe, which has required emergency measures to save banks in the UK, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market is "not just an American, but a global crisis" - the FTN Financial Analyst.
The bond market has improved significantly.
The 10-year-old government bond yield decreased from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday evening and fell from 4.357% to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama won the first television match
The two American presidential candidates were following their first debate on Friday, another one who had to decide that John McCain or Barack Obama would be released as a winner from the Battle.
Not surprisingly, both the Republican and Democrat campaign's responsives told themselves the victory in the television battle, followed by a third of American households.
Although John McCain’s action was respectable, David Gergen’s political analyst said it was not quite impressive enough to stop the decline of popularity: this is proven by five weeks before the presidential elections.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democrat candidate is better in the fight: the results published on Saturday by the public research show that Obama is five-pointed against McCain (44% and 49%).
In among the most counting, even unfinished voters, 39% of the requested voters believe that Obama will win, while 25% of their McCain wins according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase its advantage by the promising Thursday role of a party, Joseph Biden. Biden is preparing for his first and single public debate with Sarah Palin.
Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: “It would be a good idea to underestimate Palin.
He has good emotions.”
McCain’s 70-year-olds never fails to put his own undisputable foreign policy experience in the face of “naiveness” of his opponent in these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"It seems that Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." - the attack has been said several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed for the presidential position," McCain said.
This is the main attack surface that has been used by the Republican television ads that have been running since yesterday.
Obama stressed that he represents the future.
He didn’t let himself be confused: he was confronted and precisely said.
He stressed that he was able to make and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama is already yes," he cut back the democrat ad on the weekend, which puts the Republican leader in the eyes that he still has not measured the impact of the crisis on the U.S. "utca people".
"In the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama announced yesterday before twenty thousand people gathered in a shower in North Carolina for the electoral meeting.
Even the words "the middle class" or "workers" have not been put out in his mouth. The troubled situation in the financial world is undoubtedly favoured by Obama, whom the Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy at the edge of the collapse.
"The next week can be a turning point," Charles Schumer, an influential democratic senator.
According to a veteran of the Clinton government, a democratic representative of Rahm Emanuel, Obama, “in the economy, has as great instincts” as Bill Clinton, during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the view of the candidate for Democrats, the current crisis is “the final judgment over the bad economic policy over the eight years created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.”
Senator Illinois reaffirmed that despite stock exchange fluctuations it will be able to reduce the tax burdens of 95% of Americans. He added that its primary objectives include the creation of potential energy independence by using renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to establish 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates carefully avoided the issues of banking savings plan of $700 billion (470 billion): the extremely unfamiliar plan was adopted by the Congress last night.
Minsk: “They noticed that there was a choice here?”
Young and opposition protested on Sunday evening at the capital of Belarus to reject the expected results of parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening after the closure of the voting positions, hundreds of Belarus gathered on the main area of Minsk to prohibit the falsification of the electoral results.
Although results have not yet been published, many young people protested President Alexandr Lukasenko with the following words: "Diktator, give up!"
Some people admit that they didn’t even vote: “Why would I have gone? They do what they want to do with my vote?” says a young man.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which has tried to mark itself well before foreign observers for the purpose of developing contact with the European Union, would be ready to change a democratic system.
If the election were considered clear by observers, the sanctions on the country could be dissolved, in which 40 Belarusian leaders refused the visa and some bank accounts were frozen.
According to the opposition, the elections did not take place clearly.
"We were kept from the electoral committees, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote counting," he regretted Jurij Potyemkin, organized from the twelve parties, so he was very heterogenic spokesman of the United Democratic Forces coalition.
"The changes were only nominal," he stressed Alekszandr Milinkievics, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections and the leader of the Pro-European movement. "The point is to count the votes and, in our case, this executive power.
If the representatives of the opposition enter Parliament, that means that they were appointed and not elected.
But their access to Parliament allows them to be placed on television, to meet in the regions of the country and to present laws.
Therefore, the opposition must act in political life because "debate dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
For this reason, if our severely debted economy against Russia is in crisis and we are not able to renew, we risk being under the sovereignty of Russia.
“We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which monitors the electoral process, accepts the results of the vote.
It stresses that the participation rate seems too high, and the extensive organisation of the pre-voting vote (which 26% of the voters participated in Minsk) has given the opportunity to manipulate any manipulation.
“You noticed that there was a choice here?” he asked the question, the leader of the Social Democratic Alekszandr Kozulin, who was released last in August with his second release from prison, where he was held a political prisoner.
No one has abstained in voting positions.
And there will be up to five opposition representatives to the Parliament, which are the most appropriate to leadership.
The silence of the night again in October.
In television, President Lukasenko and members of the Central Election Committee will be delighted.
Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of his founding yesterday. Dr. Francine Décary had a good reason for celebration because Hema-Québec is now one of the most safe and effective blood tax companies in the world.
The most important thing is that he has been able to recover the trust of people, which has severely depressed from the impact of the scandal on infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As known, the national blood reserves treated by the Canadian Red Cross were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency symptom (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
In February 1994, after the drama and general shock, the Canadian government launched an official investigation with the leadership of Judge Horace Krever, which was aimed at exploring the circumstances that led to the tragedy and formulating proposals to avoid similar incidents in the future.
While judge Krever has submitted a delayed report, some provinces have set up their own committee to design a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Québec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood supply services were established in Canada: one of the Héma-Québec, who serves Québece, and the other of the other regions and the Canadian Protection Company.
“When Hema-Québec started its activity in 1998, nearly 38% of people had confidence in Québec’s blood supply system,” Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was desperate.
"In the coming years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field, we managed to recover the confidence of the people." Décary proudly states that almost 94% of the Quebec population already believed that Héma-Québece was reliable at the beginning of 2008.
Doctor Décary does not forget that "confidence is a very fragile thing".
Since the establishment of Héma-Québec on 28 September 1998, he has applied the principle of caution.
During this period, a number of cases have been discovered in Europe, when the mild beef disease, namely Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, has infected new variances, tells the doctor, who has been in charge of the company since its founding in 1998.
“We didn’t know if this disease was spreading through blood.
Therefore, we rely on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. In this case, if we are uncertain, and there is a risk of serious disease, we should take out measures. In this case, it was a disease in Creutzfeldt-Jakob that leads to brain changes, thus inevitably to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
For a few years, it was clear that the disease spreads through blood.
This case convinced us that it was meaningful to apply the principle of caution.”
In 1999, there was a technique on the market that allows a much more sensitive diagnosis of HIV virus. This is the nuclein acid test (NAT) that can directly detect the virus in the blood of blood transdermals and not antibodies against the virus to which the previously used tests were built.
With the NAT test, we could shorten the window period, which lasts from infection until we can show the virus in the blood with our technical means, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to a shorter period than one week.
Thus, there was a significant reduction in the risk that blood transients could not infect the blood stock outside of us and that this could not be shown.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, the risk of getting blood infected with HIV virus is 12 million for one.
“In other words, this means that we should distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400-500 thousand blood products each year, it should be over 24 years to take one such case and someone to get infected with HIV virus through a blood product.
I think that today anyone can take it calmly or enter the blood transfusion in order to restore health - says Hema-Québec's first leader.
“The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what a new pathogen comes into the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which enters into the blood with insect straps like West Nilus virus.
Therefore, we need to be constantly intimidated," continued Doctor Décary, and then stressed that Hema-Québec should take care of sufficient permanent reserves outside the emergency reserves.
“Aging the population also increases demands.
As anti-cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the stock of blood taxes, as only 3% of the population in the network is available for blood delivery.
However, every healthy, at least 18-year-old person who meets the eligibility conditions may give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled in a country where malaria destroys are not eligible for blood delivery for a year.
"We have 3% of this reserve that we can satisfy the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare that we're running out of stocks.
However, we need to increase the number of blood taxes to the extent that existing people age because they can no longer give blood after a while.
However, people are very difficult to convince them to give blood, but even more difficult to keep them and make them become regular blood taxes.
In today’s rushing world, there’s hardly one hour to give blood,” Francine Décary regrets.
Hema-Québec, a farmer of $297 million annual budget, provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, cardiac blades, eyeball tissues and leather tissues, which are used only for people who have severely burned.
These tissues are analysed, converted and frozen and then placed at the Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public stem bank in Québec.
Only a cucumber treated as medical waste can be obtained from blood that is rich in stem cells, thus allowing treatment of serious diseases (e.g. leukemia).
“We celebrated a few weeks ago that we have entered our bank for thousands of cucumbers of blood samples, and we are planning to take more than a thousand new samples each year.
At the beginning of the next year, we are likely to start offering them for organ transplants," Doctor Décary, who said the cucumber blood loss program is very popular today.
“A lot of mothers are sad because they don’t have a chance to do this,” indeed, because Héma-Québec does not have a way to make this complex and costly program available in all hospitals in Québec.
Football - in the predecision of Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders at the USL-1 executive last night at 3:1 and reached the predecision with a total score of 4:3. This was the fourth-decisioned second and decisive match for the outcomes that took place in the Saputo stadium.
The final goal of Antonio Ribeiro was acquired in the 90th minute of the game.
While the first half-time was gone without a goal, in the second two midways of the montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino found in the opponent's bedroom.
From the Sounders team alone, Roger Levesque managed to play Matt Jordan's gate.
Remember, Friday's first match was defeated by Impact 2:1 from Starfire Complex in Tukwila, Seattle.
Impact plays with Vancouver Whitecaps in the predecision.
Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder's team, which was captured by Whitecaps at 3:1, won by 4:3, yet Whitecaps came into the predecision with a total result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches are still detailed today.
In the Dióhéj - Kovalev winner goal
Canadiens' favorite trias is ready to wait for the next season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and finally Canadiens won against Florida Panthers 3:2 of criminal shootings last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, acquired a goal. Plekanec two and Kovalev closed the match with a goalpass, which was the fourth victory from the six preparatory matches of the team.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who acquired the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian player warns.
"I need another game to feel really in shape."
"He tried too much to get out of himself in the first third," Guy Carbonneau said.
"But I think the game was happy.
He has a huge ovation.”
Charest's Northern Goals
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year.
The meeting of the Liberal Party was hardly over, Jean Charest traveled to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new minister of health, Yves Bolduc, (the left) will win in the mid-term election today.
"Restore our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was set by Jean Charest at the last meeting of the québeci Liberal Party in Lévis. The speech was enriched with visual elements, while the president tried to focus on the point.
During his presentation, behind his back, there were similar series of "Moulin à images".
The three giant recordings followed each other: the barriers of water power plants, mining, Québec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during the electoral periods.
By the way, the head of government at the press conference refused to guarantee that the election would no longer start this fall, although he added that his time allocation would be very close.
The "good plan" is the fourth pillar of the "view of the future of the Prime Minister Québec", which is incorporated in a "new economic area". This includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and more conventions designed with Ontario.
In recent times, the opening to the North (i.e. the Northern Area at 49th Latitude) was often included in the Prime Minister’s speeches, but the presentation has never been held on this subject.
However, the Head of State was merely striking to explain why the North was held as "a tremendous mine full of great opportunities". However, he did not talk about the timetable, investment amounts, or a specific order of importance for future projects.
Only a few development opportunities have been highlighted: mainly water power plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth and rebuilding of state infrastructures in the blocking countries.
On the north, "nikkel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds," Charest said.
This is the area that is "two times as much as France", "the territory of our territory, Québec.
It is not only in us, but in us,” the Head of State reiterated, stressing that it intends to create a national founding myth.
He highlighted that Québec’s development was largely determined by the relationship with the North: the gold lazy in Abitib, the québeci design work, the James Bay...
“This is our future, our future,” he added, after having a stage break, he looked at the huge map behind his back.
The North of Québec includes a part of Labrador, which has always been required by Québec in the 70% of its territory - the Head of Governor said at the press conference.
“This is our historic resolution, which has been confirmed by all governments.
There is a boundary for which there is no agreement for a long time, and when it comes to an opportunity, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, “in the light of climate change, we need to reconsider our view of the North,” the Prime Minister said, talking about the northwestern passway, which is opened every year due to the melting of the corner ice.
In this new geopolitical environment, the Prime Minister believes that it is an important task to take the area.
And what about the natives, Indians and Escimos?
The Governor said that Québec’s government would pay particular attention to them, and that the plan would bring many benefits, especially for young people.
The two ministers, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau, belonging to the various parties, (the last time they were sent to the ancestor of the Party Québécois), have already started the consultation with about 30 local communities.
He also started acting by the Interministerial Committee of Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role.
The Governor does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit" where "they create a common vision".
Northern development would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly," the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this "view" as consistent with the ideas of the pre-liberal Prime Ministers.
“Just like the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges.”
This was one of the returning topics of the weekend that began on Friday with the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's party.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois power plant be baptized as an obstacle to Adélard-Godbout.
"Our politicians, including Godbout, which founded Hydro-Québece, and the national expansion of water power plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of the James Bay, knew how to build the future," Jean Charest said.
In the press conference, he also quoted another, true, conservative work, namely John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister "Roads to the North" between 1957 and 1963.
President Charest pointed out the planning of Eastmain1a-Ruper water power plant.
“This is between us, but I’m planning to be there,” he told his calls, and he accepted a loud storm.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no choice in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which the law also allows.
He stressed, however, that the calendar was now full, as he took duties at the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and at the Québec-New York summit.
At the end of the week, the party meeting has proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal President to develop nationalist decisions, which have been approved almost without thinking. Here is mainly the "impositional ambitions": the Liberal Party, in particular, demands the recognition of the specific character of Québec in the Constitution.
I would also like Québec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunication Council, and these members would have the right to vote on the decisions made in Québec.
However, the opposition adopted the main points of the North Plan skeptically.
The Head of the Party Québécois, Paulina Marois, reintroduced the North Qeébet Development Policy, which was introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government in 2003 rejected the application of this policy.
If they hadn't done it, "We'd be a long way ahead", Marois said in agreement with Mrs Françoise Mercure, who was initiated by Jean-Talon on the vote today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the adoption of the North Plan.
“We would like to do this not merely a play,” said Sébastien Proulx’s party leader, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his freedom today.
Letters - A Lost Country
Vic Toews, Minister of the Harper Cabinet (or the Minister of Justice), took the courage to call Louise Arbourt as a “sacrifice” in Canada last summer.
Thus, despair of a woman who has constantly fought for the truth and deserves all our admirations - it tells a lot about the people around the prime minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government who did not deliver his own nationals home from the Guantanamo concentration camp in some of the Western countries concerned.
This is the government that absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of committing crimes.
This is the only government that, despite the signing of the Geneva Convention in Canada, refused his word and allowed a child soldier to fall under inhuman circumstances.
The only government that makes a puppet theater of justice while examining the guilt of a accused.
Just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian lawyers also require Omar Khadr to be delivered home so that it can be held fairly in Canada.
And our government is watching over the cake: it doesn’t matter that a young adult has been mentally completely destroyed now, and many years of torture probably sealed his destiny for life.
Although we are not yet aware of this, we are currently devastating our rights, freedom and democracy. "Democraticity": Harper has repeatedly voiced this word, which sounds merely empty from his mouth.
It was then time when there was no more morality: they could be slandered, tortured and imprisoned by any Canadian citizen in the spirit of a government leader who had been in minority until now (and what can happen after October 14, ...).
Many voters believe that the salvation can be found at a party that boasts the virtue, the Law and the Order. They do not see that this government has the feet of the values that our country has given thanks to the good news and dignity.
Dear Mr Toews, the shame is more like this - don't look anywhere else.
Opinion on Barrick Gold Orwell
Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Vice President of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine.
After Orwell’s advocacy, Garver declares that the world’s largest gold producer company has launched a six million-dollar advocacy against three authors and a small-financed publisher in order to initiate a so-called "publical debate".
Although the judges are independent and unbiased, their decision, especially in abuse proceedings, is not based on the truth, but on the law.
It is not surprising that Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Would Barrick Gold really be the best way to disrupt anyone whose position is contradictory to him?
Regardless of the outcome of the case, Noir Canada’s authors and publishers must spend significant amounts to protect and fight in an inequality struggle where the army of lawyers supported by almost unfulfilled sources of the mining industry on the other side.
In this unequal struggle, however, the tactics are often used to destroy the defendant and make a friendly agreement that they not only silence the opposite, but also fear those who would try to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he would have had to explain his views before the public.
Although in many other countries, where Barrick Gold operates, this happens differently, in Canada, the disputers usually do not hit each other with a bot, but say their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had enough to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in press, media, publications, paying for independent research groups that could have found light on the question.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust the public opinion, and with a move, he misleads requests and letters written in the protection of Noir Canada's authors.
May Mr Garver explain how to initiate a "public" debate, if you fail to take the opinion of this public at the same time?
In the head of the Vice-President, this word is likely to mean only lawyers paid in his bus, and not Canada’s overall population: the meaning of the term is very narrow.
In a democratic state, the freedom of speech also deserves other judges.
Barrick Gold, however, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that Noir Canada’s authors and publishers are mainly supported by the public because it condemns the rough method of mining.
The public opinion is ready to listen to Barrick and make judgments, but on the basis of civilized arguments, rather than by a lot of people to be silent. (In other words, Barrick Gold recently called on authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver's surreal deliberations, the Barrick Gold procedure openly attacks the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the builders of all democratic society.
In the whole procedure, it denies the right to quote authentic resources, to debate on facts and interpretations, which are the basis of spiritual activities.
If a country like Canada can only study and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of today’s world, who will take courage?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could be done according to the scientific standards that the Noir Canada authors apply.
You have the right to answer.
We have been able to deal with disputes, differences and conflicts for a long time.
The irrelevant procedure of Barrick Gold shows that, unlike claim, there is no desire to engage in an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the Canadian public disputes, and it is now time for governments to take measures that limit legal procedures for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue - Democrats and Republicans agreed
The Republican and Democrat leaders of the Bush Government and the Congress reached agreement yesterday on the economic rescue action, which has been the biggest set of such a plan since the 1930s major economic crisis.
The $700 billion plan, designed to prevent the financial crisis on Wall Street for months, should still be approved by the two houses of Congress.
Important points of the plan: better control of implementation by representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the proposed public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses reserved due to the failure of payments; access to the payment of the managers of the companies benefiting from the assistance.
Henry Paulson, U.S. Minister for Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the U.S. Parliamentary House, and President Judd Gregg, the Republican representative in the trial, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes before midnight after the two-day marathon negotiations have ended.
"We have made a great step towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets," said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush government.
"We have done everything to save real economy and American citizens from the current Wall Street crisis," the democrat spokesman explained.
"The most important aspect is that if we don't do this, then the shock, chaos, and confusion in the everyday lives of the Americans will be huge," said Judd Gregg, Republican representative.
Negotiation has been accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have a negative impact on investors' mood.
The stock exchange has given you a deadline for opening this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations were willing to agree, nevertheless, they are not happy that the situation has increased to the end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed the extension of the agreement to elements such as the maintenance of household property or the payment of the heads of companies assisted by the State.
“When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary steps for the irresponsibility of other people, it is not a very pleasant thing.
But these steps are necessary," he noted in an American television show.
When the opponent, John McCain asked if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied, “I would like to know the details, but I hope so.”
“What I’ve read in large lines, it’s something we all have to digest and we can move on.
The possibility of not doing anything is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the 700 billion plan, taxpayers would buy doubtful claims of US financial institutions, something risked, unsale assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis, which was initiated by the loss of the property lufi. This was the first to bring about the collapse of risky real estate loans (second mortgage loans) and then spread to other debt-intensive (trading) securities, and ultimately caused the freezing of liquid resources and the disruption of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was failed by a group of Republican representatives last week.
It seems that we have been able to get out of this trash since the democrats have agreed that certain "toxic" tools of firms in difficult situations would be guaranteed by the government rather than by buying it.
In order to be satisfied by all members of the Congress, a provision has been included in the plan which requires that if the government has to bear losses within the programme for five years, it may impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a 250 billion dollars would first be paid; this could be followed by another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The remaining $ 350 billion payment should be approved by the Congress with a new vote.
In exchange for the help, Washington acquires a share in supported companies, allowing profits to be dividended and sold after the crisis is broken.
The federal government will be able to delay the booking of mortgage loans covered by the plan. In addition, it will be possible to set the maximum value of wages and withdrawals to the leaders of companies affected by the crisis.
The developers of the plan would like to vote on the plan today by the Parliament and the Senate on Wednesday.
However, despite their forces, it is still not sure that the plan is approved.
Yesterday, the statements against the plan were repeated among both the Republicans and the Democrats.
“It’s clear that Washington doesn’t hear your voice,” she announced to its electorate, Scott Garrett, who is a member of the Financial Committee of the House.
“We have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that would benefit taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, a democrat representative of the small congress group, called the "sceptical group", shows things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic specialists, including three Nobel Prize scientists, have written to us to ask Congress: do not hurry, and look carefully at which path you choose," Sherman said yesterday.
At the same moment in Europe, it was once again understood that it was a global crisis.
After a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion) would state part of the Fortis banking group.
The intervention of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg governments became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that he would not buy the bankruptcy competitor after the loss of EUR 2 million (2.9 billion US dollars) due to the crisis of secondary mortgage loans in the United States.
With Fortis 85,000 employees, one of the 20 largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies.
"This money is not thrown out," Wouter Bos said yesterday, Minister of Finance in the Netherlands.
“We have a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation is uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Manche, the British government seems to be preparing to nationalize another bank, which has been broken down by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the total of the ongoing loans of the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which real estate loans cost 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars).
The Spanish Santander Bank announced yesterday that they were going to buy the British bank’s subsidiaries and clients.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has been trying to nationalize since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Goodbye to the actress server
According to some people, the eyes of beautiful asures were the main bat cards, others believed it was the main weakness.
Did the American actress ever get rid of the mirror of the narchy?
Yeah, and I don't.
Through its shyness, sensitivity, and her born talent, it was also distant from the stretch style, which is the spirit of the real great monsters of the art world.
But what a huge path he ran in.
Paul Newman died in lung cancer at the age of 83 on Friday at connecticut's possession, and he was one of the last icons of American cinema flowers.
There was fewer monumental individuality, like Brando, who used to be a competitor for a long time. He was more repulsive and more vulnerable in his series, but he also announced freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood often comes from extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian-born mother.
European roots contributed to the birth of a symbolic form of American dream.
He didn't think too much about himself, which just enhanced his merits.
His idea of self-made man and the fantasy of the war in the Pacific War. In the early 1950s, the Yale University was a drama and then learned at the New York Actor's Studio before she exploded into the theatre, television and not much later in the cinema world.
In addition to being a vigilant of civil rights, he reached a second position in 1979 on the Le Mans 24-hour race. In addition, he was considered a sex symbol, although he had been married to a happy actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we will never know the shadows of the life of this mysterious, closed, work-inspired actress who hated the shining of the show-business. This remains mystery forever.
He was honest in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked the cinema enthusiasts: in his big roles we can only see in the black screen of memories.
The seventh American art has been in front of us for more than fifty years of continuous change in the cinema.
In our memory, a young man who is obsessed with "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" in the 1969, and his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role was seen in Tennessee Williams' work in the "Children on the hot boldder" in 1958.
From recent times (1990), we can remember in the image of sensitive Mr. Bridge who, at the age of age, faces the fact that his marriage has not changed his hopes.
In addition, Paul Newman has seen many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise’s film “Something Upside”, the unforgettable formation of the role of a storm-life criminal, rocky Graziano. This originally designed for James Dean, and after his death, started his career in Newman in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in a brilliant work called "The Great Abuse", which won Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Robert Rossen, in his brilliant film "The Svindler" (1961), played a revengeable billiard player and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's "The Color of Money" film. He received a single Oscar prize in 1987 from nine marks.
Changeful times, but always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like that.
The period of his career was marked by the change of the ages.
The youngest are known mainly from George Roy Hill's Cultural Film "Icebreakers" (1977), where Reggie Dunlop, a coach working with not too ordinary methods.
He was seen in the "The Great Jump" recorded by the Coen Brothers in 1994.
The series of Sam Mendes films "The Way of the Dead" closed in 2003: it was the last one to see in the role of an Irish Mafia Chief.
In contrast to many cinema legends who had left the movies relatively quickly, Newman remained in a reflector light for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its shining, shining and imagination.
Bertrand Tavernier, French film director, did not think that without all humor, it was "the live scratch of subplay": he said his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always graceful with the handsome Paul Newman, who has been falling into his face for a long time.
However, he has rarely played young and successful characters: he has created figures for whom he was able to return his drift and rebels with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a less known face: in the depth of his soul, he has a truly memorable and sensitive man.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (which was the adaptation of Margaret Laurence’s novel in Canada), Joanne Woodward and his wife, the main role of a melancholic woman, painted a fine portrait of a melancholic woman.
"Harry and son", made in 1984, and with a film of repression and sadness, he remembrances his son, Scott, who died in drug extinction.
Yesterday, Newman’s numerous honourers remembered the actress. His close friend and old warrior Robert Redford (with whom they played in "The Great Challenge" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said, "He has made my life and the world better."
The joy of generosity and being: this was the secret of this great actress’s vibrant personality that we have just lost.
In addition to its legendary career, his comments on civil rights, the environment, the struggle for independent film production, and Hollywood's racing.
We have often seen his image smiling at the packaging of sauces, cakes and other foods. He made it pretty bad with oral taste, although at the beginning he thought it was funny.
However, revenue from such sales has always been transferred to the Foundation for Children with Disease.
Newman never sat on his babes: he's always been committed to his profession.
In his five daughters’ letter, he wrote the following sentences: “Your father has always been incredibly grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
It is also a privilege for us to carry out the career of such a glorious and generous American artist.
He was a sample citizen, above all.
What was produced in Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, 8 October, the trial against Zuschlag John and his associates will begin.
Politicians and associates are accused of fraud and other criminal offences, including criminal counterfeiting.
According to the Public Prosecutor, the earned calls were used for their own purposes and the performance of the tasks was often verified by unreal invoices.
Public and municipal funds, totally about 65 million forints, were migrated into the School of the Young Left, partly into the pocket of some people.
The method described by the investigative authority was that the tender funds received were taken on the basis of cost accounts that had not actually been completed, and the associations have never complied with the commitment undertaken.
According to the accusation, most of the accounts were false.
These were purchased on the charter market, and the circulars were manufactured in Kiskunhala.
And what companies should be called account production, including on the left-wing road to which John Zuschlag sent Lados István.
He said he had to look for beds and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice on his consumption there, which, in its pattern, was then prepared for the applications of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, Social and Labour Wallet and the Capital Government.
In most cases, István Lados noted these with his associate, Heritage, who, according to our information, wrote the most necessary reports to win the aid.
One of Lados' study paths was a beer house.
According to two accounts issued by Zuschlags in 2003, the hosting facility provided the meals of the ninety-nine groups of the Biztos Pont Association.
But that's what the company manager said they wouldn't have been able to access the restaurant at the same time.
In the same way, for the Better Future, together with the Third Eighth Century, the Foundation issued its accounts in the summer of 2002 from formal and content errors.
A badacsonytomaji pension was only three rooms, and more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet the account was about hundreds of thirty guests.
But the fantastic form fillers were overrun even when they indicated the Pigal Kft., which, according to the information provided to the accusation, did not include documents for the Better Future and Hoppa's name.
The company's manager, Wolf Győzt told Hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor and showed him accounts, he knew it was about false documents.
"The stamp was in the wrong place of our company's name and tax number."
He added that, in addition to the formal reasons, it was not correct that hundreds of people were accommodationd in the account, as there are 11 rooms in which there is no room to access.
In addition, the account also called for a meal, while their restaurant isn’t working long ago.
The enthusiastic accountkeepers did not follow the fact that the Budapest travel agency looked only for foreign roads, so in Botorul advocated travel in Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which was also not agreed with the company’s accounting practice.
In addition, as shown in the investigation, the VAT was included in the document, where travel activities to non-EU countries were free of VAT.
Among other things, the degree of VAT was wrong in four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Ltd for the Better Future, since the company’s service is not charged by the 25 but 15 percent, and the hotel employees only issued a machine account, while the most processed account was handy.
In addition, the "exporters" have failed the bill that a company has been designated a road freight transport as an activity carried out - it has been discovered through the prosecution procedure - which the company, based on the initial investment advice, did not carry out.
In addition, due to formal deviations - an inappropriate account form, not a real stamp - that together with the Third Eighth Century Foundation, the XXI century Cultural Association and the Biztos Point accounts were false.
As for Ravenna Bt. or the Kunvalectory Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they would have issued the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not observe the fact that the HIB Ltd. had been erased at the time (2001) when the group of the Young City Association had eaten, and that’s why the company’s liquidator officer, as we know it, denied that he had made the paper.
Knowledge
Another group of issuers is those who were aware of the need to issue a figurative account.
The event for Budapest Foundation has issued an invoice for the Third Century Foundation at the request of Young Socialists, about four million HUF.
Collab Kft.'s leader, according to the accusation, is one of the accused, George Ludovic, who released his figurative account.
He also cooperated with Zuschlags, the Biogate Ltd, currently being erased, which in 2003 was the Foundation for the Better Future, the Atlas Association and the Redfeny Association with roughly fifty million HUF accounts, which were not the real economic activity behind.
No money movement, because the completed accounts were torn after, but the organizations have already forgotten to include it in their documents.
The following group of companies issuing the invoice belongs to those that can be linked to the accused.
Thus, Delta Trió Ltd. was not the Ukrainian CEO of Cubatov Iván.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several accounts on the sale of computing equipment at approximately EUR 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these accounts were purchased since 14 September 2005 by Littlekunhalasi Cash Investment Ltd...
This company was the CEO of a Romanian man who would also have sent Cubatov Iván documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005.
In the course of the investigation, Cubatov acknowledged that he issued an invoice on behalf of the Kft. to the Atlas, Hoppa and the Third Century Foundation together, and he took their counterparts.
On the request of Iván Cubatov, Romanian rockworkers founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and Jos-Investment Bt..
However, none of the companies actually worked, which the accused said was the reason they didn’t get a job.
However, it has benefited from the companies because the defendant’s partner, who also made the papers of the company founding, issued accounts on behalf of the companies to the associations related to Zuschlag: the Atlas and the Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Cubatov gave 15 accounts for organizations, worth 14,2 million forints.
The prosecutor believed that 10 percent of the amounts indicated in the accounts and the VAT hit Cubatov marks.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of physique bills, and they were manufactured for the tender of the Sure Point.
The Y-Generation and the Association submitted an application for Modern Hungary in January 2006 to the Socialist Party’s public benefit organization, the Mihály Dance Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
In order not to find out, the Works Team Ltd. received five fictional accounts to the TMA.
These invoices were found, by the way, during the search in the office at the educational wallet of Árpád Kemecsai.
In the trial, some of the accuseds, as they did at the prosecutor's office, are likely to report on the course of accounting.
Most interesting can be if you are the first accused, John Zuschlag decides to appeal to everything.
Eddigi’s statement is not too detailed, and although he has promised to speak over everything, he has not yet done that.
The question is whether it is for this purpose, perhaps for a large part of the damage, and for a return of fifty million forints, the socialists have negotiated with him, and Zusi will take the fall.
Anyone who could have been offended today, since his requests for home arrest were constantly found on deaf ears to alleviate the circumstances of his detention.
While the victims of far greater damage and non-refunding economic crimes can walk freely or at least in their own homes, they have no chance to do so.
Psychology of overlicitation: Why are we giving more money?
In auctions, customers tend to release more money, overestimate the goods.
This known - and seemingly irrational - behavior has revealed the neurological-economy foundations of the New York University of Neurologists and economists.
According to their study in Science, people do not want to fall below in a type of competition such as the auction of eBay, so they will rather pay too high prices.
The research tried to map this "play" nervous system by using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers participated in a lottery, another group of players, while the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) examined the active brain areas of experimental individuals.
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but during the auction game, in which the other party’s oversubjection of the essential element, the stratiatum, under the stratiatum, was intensively operational when the game was lost.
This brain area plays a role in the mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, researchers say that price leakage can be explained by avoiding the intense reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the research team’s economists also carried out a financial follow-up investigation.
In this, the three groups bid against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group simply told me how much the real value of the product is and they made their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they get out of the game, they will be rewarded for $15.
However, the third group received just $15 before the auction, but the members of the group lost this money in case of a loss auction.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, only to one of them, the loss was stressed for one of them.
However, demonstrating the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team who played against "loss" were willing to do higher than the control and "loss" group.
These results cannot be derived from any theory of the economy that has previously existed.
They have explained only the phenomena in auction with the joy of victory and risk avoidance.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped to solve the contradiction between these two theories by getting a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economic faculty at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we contact a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and in Hungary, the leading causes of death are mentioned in chronic liver disease.
The number of hepatitis-infected people at home can be achieved by 100 000, but only seven thousand, due to which patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the collection name of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms, there are many similarities, typical of liver inflammation and yellowness, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms, depending on the pathogen: through the hepatitis A and E (e.g. with infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body wets (both, vaginal, saliva).
Travelers should be protected by vaccination against viruses A and B, no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis Symptoms occur two to three weeks after infected food consumption, generally with bad feeling, weakness, abdominal complaint, nausea.
After this, the yellowness on the skin and on the white eye, the stool becomes clear, the urine becomes dark, healing can take two to three weeks.
A million people die worldwide in a more serious type of disease, caused by hepatitis B in liver cancer and liver sugor.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected receives medication treatment.
Hepatiit C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can also lead to liver suppression, liver cancer.
Most infected people don’t even know about their disease, because the pathogen destroys the liver cells subtlely, in many cases the first symptoms occur only 20-30 years later.
Thus, early prevention, regular filtering tests are very important.
In three groups, the average of these diseases is much more than that: people who have been transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattooed.
The number of chronic hepatitis C virus infected is currently 200 million in the world.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is appropriate to contact a doctor when detecting any unidentified symptoms of origin.
In time of detection of the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, thus eliminating the infectiousness and preventing the development of cancer.
On 30 September, the World Day of Hepatitis was organised first in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
It aims to draw attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, causes of development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Whoever believes in God hurts less?
According to a recent study, religious faith works as a kind of pain relief, which could already facilitate the death of Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, studied how God’s faith affects people’s pain sensation, and announced the British Telegraph.
As part of the fairly bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were involved in electros, while all studied paintings representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of the pain.
Thanks to the human brain-drying technique, Catholics were also able to activate the part of their brains that were responsible for regulating pain.
The study is the first in a research series in which scientists, philosophers and theologians also participate in different parts of the university.
The test was precisely the result of a sparkling device being reinforced to the left hand of the experimental subject, which provided the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants to look at two paintings, the painting of the Virgin Mary by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century with the female hermelin.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of Mary Virgin would create a kind of religious state among the believers, while the image of Da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and thought it was a reassuring effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour on a MRI scanner machine, during this time they received 20 electro shocks in four consecutive parts while they looked at the religious topic or the general picture.
The Catholics reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "security" like "problem" and "rested, peace spent them".
When watching a religious image, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo was seen.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who participated in the study himself, thinks that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, including the atheists, should only be found in the correct photo.
"We need to find a picture of someone who feels very positive for him like a mother or a father."
Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases will change our personality," Wright added.
After the great results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a similar calibre painter show the image of a madonna to the believers, how would that affect their pain control?
Would Mary’s vision of quality Virgin represent even better results?
You're the one you're sharing about yourself.
On the 10th birthday of Google, you can tell Google: you can find at least as much in the pocket of people as in the sky; you know where they have been vacationed, what special orders they are going on and what they are interested in.
And that's still not enough, Eric Schmidt, according to one of the company's main men.
However, as regards the skeptics of the Orwellian horror, they do not see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently announced to Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more personal data about their users, and this is necessary to keep themselves in the original goal of Google founders, which said, "We'll collect all the world's information."
According to Google’s spoken leader, the company is still at the beginning of 10 years of world-wide work to manage all the information.
Question about what would happen in five years, Schmidt replied: “You want Google to answer questions like “what to do tomorrow” or “what work really suits me?” but until then, software can’t answer such simple questions because they don’t respond to the users.
Not all interneters are aware that searchwords are accurately recorded during online searches, what IP address they were looking for, and after the search, what page interested people left.
For example, through the personalized Search launched two years ago, users can store their own surfing background history, look back on what they were looking for, clicking on, and thus generate more personalized findings for them in the long run – the same logic will be based on the Recommendations with which products and services are offered to us by the system based on our previously stated and fixed preferences.
What if you use my data against me if you look at what I'm dealing with? - ask users who are worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the potential level of power represented by the company may be frightening, not guilt, fear of punishment, the desire of freedom, but the rebel against power in the interneters.
However, it is confirmed that all the requested terms are not only recorded, but may be transferred to a third party, in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of internet users.
The loudest example of this recent period may have been a coordinated action against Brazilian pedofils, in which Google provided information on the social site Orkut, which was reserved by the Brazilian government, to enable the identification of pedofils.
However, internet users who were concerned about personal rights could have been depressed even in May when the company successfully proved to be in court against the FBI by carrying out the EFF’s electronic legal protection organization: Google may not be forced to provide any information in secret by the FBI.
(When the federal government successfully fought about fifteen thousand web addresses and thousands of searches, which were received by reference to the confirmation of the child protection law adopted in the past, but did not succeed in obtaining the search lists of individual users or a full website and keyword list covering two months.)
Google’s judgment is quite controversial: those who keep their personal data from giving, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life are beginning to use Google’s services and that conservative imaginary multi-companies are exposed to a riot.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its inspiring computer fans, activists, users, sees the next generation of large companies, the "going corporation" in them, unlike rival, the Microsoft booked as a world conqueror for Windows, as far as both fight for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not request an identification code from its users other than Microsoft, does not ask for money for its applications, open, free, constantly kept source codes and program packages are much more accessible, younger, cooler than the official software experience.
However, it may also be because the geek accurately see the relationship between personality rights and the internet, which is just one of the most commonly voiced keywords in the past years, the web has drawn 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about nothing more than co-laboration, the fact that we are deliberately leaving trails and using communication channels available to us, and while these levels change individually, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
A average young person can also lead a profile from Facebook to Xang, link them to other services such as Twitter or musical habits, and then link them to follow-up systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, which can automatically appear on their latest photography galleries stored on Flickr or on Picasa.
While we can read a number of examples of cases that are illustrated: a friend can easily realize the morning photo stream of the common friend circle, seeing who his cheating friend spent the evening or can fire a company’s worker only because he describes his honest opinion in his blog about top management: a certain private life concept has been completely reassessed for now.
If you live online, it consists of what you show yourself, this is how we can express the fundamentality behind the behavior of today’s young people.
If you want to hide something or at least want to avoid Google monopoly, you can do it (for example, using the Google search system, but at the same time using the Scroogle not deliberately leaving a trace).
For example, the number of people who do not register with purpose to avoid appealing to social sites can be replaced by alternative versions that do not bind to giant server parks and which do not combine the best profile we have ever had.
The public opinion does not wait so secretly when Google shows the protein of his teeth.
The company’s current $156 billion worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising interfaces threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the services introduced in an increasing pace cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but also to many other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, find contradictions that affect the worryer: for example, the top management completely rejected the protest of employees, after raising the company's caregiver's fee to double, the company's management found it too costly for employees to eat on a daily basis, however, it is all broken by the fact that Google was driving a head before the Chinese government in 2006 and under their agreement, the company's filtration of all the hits that violate good taste and Chinese regimen interests.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds like that they do not advertise a new service in advance only when the Google book and magazine scanning and archivation project is already used, but the surely problems of the coming months and years can move the world again: while some people believe that Google’s book and magazine scanning and archivation project has so many sizes that the company will soon have to face the Supreme Court of America, others are afraid of the Health system, while we can build a complete health profile of ourselves with our previous inventions, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database is that the next generation of sci-fi writers can also provide a good material, the popular Cory Doctorow novel, the Scroogled point orwelli, describes the future in which a person is alarmingly approachable from Google’s data.
Two young people helped the dual killer of the Rose in the trail
Two young people were interviewed by the police in the case of a dual murder in Rooti, suspected that they were assisted in the detention of the trails of the crime, said the spokesman of the police officer in Borsod County on Tuesday.
Young people have recognized their burdens and are currently accused of crime.
The two young people - according to the MTI information, two girls - are protected freely.
Distortion can also be punished by a loss of freedom for up to five years.
The suspect of the two murders in Rootdi, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
Predetermined by profits, suspected by crimes committed by more people.
The investigation revealed that 23-year-old young man owed a larger amount to 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn’t want to balance his debt, so he was cheating his creditor on a rose place last Wednesday, where he ended up with his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was prepared to commit a crime, this is also a sign that he committed the murder with a gun hidden on the site.
The police will examine the circumstances of the weapon and use by including an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - were offered to buy a hundred-dollar stock market in Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polishs despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in public hands.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which expects to sell more than 60% of the papers over a few months.
The new Czech Economic Daybook E15 knows that the Polish offer represents the highest amount that interested people have so far offered for the Prague Exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Belgian stock exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Stock Exchange have submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, the chief of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner and would not rule out that this would lead to the loss of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague exchange is estimated by market experts at 5 to 10 billion kroons.
Under the agreement of the shareholders, about 90 percent of the papers could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with approximately 25% share, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.r.l. by 13.5%.
From the perspective of European papers on the financial crisis
European newspapers in their Tuesday commentary on the growing international financial crisis have already been referred to as the “second of September 11.”.
We thank the President of the United States of America for the global financial disaster - accused the Roman La Repubblica - the President could not even list his own party behind a proposal for a law that has been put together in his wound, which aims to cure the despair situation...
Instead of Pearl Harbor, mentioned by Warren Buffett billionaires, it is more appropriate to talk about the second September 11.
Some of the Madridi press sees the crime in Washington.
According to El Mundo’s view, the lack of political leadership in the country has brought the world economy to the edge of the collapse.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, however, following the congress vote, the threat is that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the biggest changes in capitalism's history are happening.
The threat can no longer be ignored - it shows the Genfi Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still provide backup to support financial institutions today and save them from bankruptcy with the money of taxpayers.
However, if more banks fall together like dominosocks, neither the funds nor any further prompting will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for Member States of the European Union to overcome their national self-control and to centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
Only Monday, more than €100 billion were received by weakening financial institutions - reminds me of the Vienna Der Standard, that the concerns that, like the Americans, European taxpayers have to take their pockets deeply in order to cure the crisis.
The EU has not been seriously concerned with the crisis that is tsunami throughout the old continent.
The "scuiters" will not have to lodge nearly 100 billion euros, but it would be good to note: in which case it is reasonable to apply to taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The flight of the dongo is immersed by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop the technologies that can avoid collision if not imitation of barrier sensors in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprise project presented at CEATEC in Japan, dongo bees gave the strategic starting idea of Nissan engineers in order to build the next generation of collision avoiding systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a biosecond autobot control system of type BR23C, a robotized miniature car, which was equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that eliminates all impacts.
During the flight, every bee develops its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our security protective cover - explained at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, CEO of Technology PR and Research Development.
It is important to play a role in the complex eyes of the bee that can see in all directions in more than 300 degrees of vision.
To copy the complex eye function, engineers touched the idea of laser telemeters.
It identifies obstacles within a 2 metre range of 180 degrees of BR23C, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into an operation to avoid the impact.
During the break part of the second, the obstruction occurs and then the autoboot is imprinted by the movements of the bee, changing the direction immediately by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid impact.
In any way different from the current system, this avoidance maneuver is done in a completely inspiring way.
“If this wasn’t the case, the car robot would not respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Car Robot project.
It must react in an inspiring way and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layers of safety protective covers, a layer within which the impact is currently considered to be inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must be under an eyelash.
However, in a different way from the bees, the difference cannot be directed upwards, downwards or overwards, can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction of wheel rotation.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibility available to bees to avoid other bees, only rotation and acceleration and slowing were used as an option for the autorobot.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batterys that are easier and more density of their energy, meaning that their lifetime is longer than the lithium-ion version.
Andoh says the instinctive intelligent reaction is an important, not the ability to process data, even less storage.
This structure must process and respond to only a few input signals per second.
It is not necessary to maintain them and react with intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvre data, so it is constantly using only a few dozen kilobets of memory.
There is no need for memories of gigabam, or just a memorial size.
This is the first step to develop technology for immediate exclusion, which can be included in serial cars within ten years, according to Nissan estimates.
Additional application may be possible to co-incorporate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to drive the car to the specified end target by avoiding obstacles on the road.
His name was also the poisoned child.
The written version has been completed for the 700 billion dollars of economic rescue packages for the purchase of bad loans by banks in several detail.
Firstly, half of the amount is spent.
According to the Eastern Coast time, the Congress leaders came to an adventure of a total of $700 billion rescue package, which has been going on for days, reported by Reuters.
We have made a serious progress - said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American Parliament, who believes that there is only one left to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain supported the compromise on the package.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said about the outcome of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but it will also be necessary to do more. Pelosi says this is not about saving Wall Street, but about the reverse of the economy.
The written version of the package was published in the Asian markets in Washington by Sunday evening 8 (i.e. before Monday morning two hours), but did not cause a spectacular run at the stock market.
The draft legislation on the Act of the Act on Economic Emergency Stability Act of 2008 on the Programme will first be voted on Monday by the Parliament and then on Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night and welcomed the news of the agreement at the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress achieved at night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy - Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House.
By the way, the programme differs from the original proposal for Bush administration, which would have meant that $700 billion would have been spent on buying a low-quality, credit guaranteed securities.
Most of the first time, up to half of the amount of 700 billion can be spent using 250 billion immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on Monday, which will depend on the President's decision, the Ministry of Finance's loan-backed, poor-classified securities.
The programme will be reviewed by a separate body in which the President of the Federal Reserve participates.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on the Congress’s new decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may use a combined tactic: buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage securities at the same time, or other types of "toxic" loans.
Buying within auctions and can be done directly - the minister's competent authorities have said.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial wallet guarantees the means to be charged to concern, for which the companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law sets the necessary instruments so as to get up to $700 billion into the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether to buy the wrong assets widely or to avoid a system risk resulting from a collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as they sign it.
However, the heads of banks waiting for state aid may expect to limit their departing money - which is simply called gold ejectory by the overseas slang - to the government.
Payments are limited only in certain cases, and the limits depend on how the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if you purchase the Ministry under the auction, you will be extraditioned on the gold ejector unless you retire the distributed bank manager.
When purchasing bad loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that managerial money is not overreacted.
The picture includes that existing gold parachute contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs - commented on the measure by the President of the Committee responsible for the Financial Services of the Parliament, Barney Frank, the Democrat Party.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State acquires the right to acquire shares, thus the risk of taxpayers is reduced, as they can ultimately win in the transaction as the economy and the rescued bank is recovering.
The draft law contains that in the next five years, the President must submit a presentation to the Congress which provides how to return the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were people who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, i.e. not protect the taxpayers' dollars - said by the Republican representative Darrell Issa in California.
Ohio’s Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believed that the actions were the same as those who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Do you need a visa to the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a great opportunity to enter into the American-Hungarian visa-free agreement on 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his view, “this time everything depends on whether the electronic entry and control system is being developed overseas at the time.”
At the same time, he pointed out that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists will have to register themselves before they leave.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Minister of Foreign Affairs Condoleezza Rice, who will be transferred to the Central Cross of the Hungarian Foreign Affairs Interpretation of the Stargal to advocate and discussions with the Democratic Party Barack Obama and the Foreign Policy Advisors of President John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are next to the bank rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates of the two great American parties, provided on Sunday the government's 700 billion-dollar banking aid package, but there is a politician who demands the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
Following the Marathon talks on Sunday morning, Congress and administration have been announced on Sunday mornings: they have concluded an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to dissolve the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain also point out that it is more suitable for a competitor to take the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, Obama has gained some advantages by the predecessor of economic issues and the advantage of McCain, which he received after the Republican Convention, by appointment of Vice President Sarah Palin.
Obama at a Detroit campaign meeting on Sunday expressed his hope that the Law on the 700 billion package will quickly be adopted by the Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included consumer passports that he also supported.
“We have to act now, with responsibility (...) for your position, savings, the entire industry, threatens the stability of the whole economy,” he said before the 35 thousand crowds.
He did not miss McCain's economic ideas as over time.
McCain said in an interview with ABC: “We will all find it hard to swallow it (...) but nothing is simply a way to go.”
The Republican Senator announced that the proposal included the establishment of the Committee on Finance Supervisory and the limitation of the termination of the executives, he insisted on them.
Obama told CBS McCain that McCain had no worthwhile role in the discussions, but he was in contact with the minister every day.
Prime Minister Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House would hopefully vote on the draft law on Monday.
Kidself of the German Language Area
The right-wing camp is unaffected, only within the camp, the voters became more self-conscious - so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak role of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haidhers are ready to govern Austria to prevent red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In his article on the website of the German newsmagazin, Franz Walter, the revolution of Bajorország, analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a known politician, the CSU erosion has already begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
For decades, the Christian socialists have renewed Bajoran, and now these modern citizens turn away from them.
The change in the age is also the whole Christian democracy, so is Angela Merkel's problem.
The failure was not quite surprising for the CSU, but a process ended on Sunday, which was likely to be nearly ten years ago: an undeniable hegemony of a state party has ceased.
For 10 years, in 1998, CSU landed 47.7 percent, first under the 50s level.
This has been repeated three years in the 2005 Bundesag elections, so it was mentioned in the Stoiber era.
This is why the modernization carried out consistently by the CSU in the region, which eats his parents.
Sociologists have been prophesiing this for 40 years, but they were mistaken in the pace. However, there could not have been any consequences for the CSU of the voters' loyalty to the evolutionary regions of Secularization, Educational Results, Eastern and North Germans.
Modernisation is accompanied by the growth of opportunities and the political consequences of this.
The right-wing camp is unaffected, only within the camp, the voters became more self-conscious, critical, self-conscious.
It is also noteworthy that in the last few weeks, the classic civil groups have been most distant from CSU; they are free-employed, industrialists, graduates and higher-level graduates.
Here, CSU support has been reduced by 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Vienna Daybook "Who, Who? The party deals with the disruptive coalition issues" article deals with the disruptive domestic policy situation after Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The EVP prohibits SPÖ intervention in its internal cases.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the greens don't want to negotiate coalition yet.
The election took place, now everything turns around the coalition; in the debate held in the public service television, the party leaders had little access to their cards.
President Werner Faymann SPÖ confirmed that he would like to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is quite possible - in some regions and in the social partnership.
The question is, can you imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, with the current President of the ÖVP, as a beginner, has left Faymann open.
As she said, the Schüssel-Molter course was voted out anyway.
Repeating this direction is not about.
Molterer responded carefully to red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal cases of the ÖVP.
To choose the opposition or enter the coalition, the parties are currently completely open, the questions must be discussed within the EVP.
President Haider BZÖ again appeared open to all directions.
"How to prevent red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for government," Haider said.
Vehicles: We need to break the devil circle of poverty, segmentation
Today, in Paris, the European Conference of Equality, which is the host of France, representing the presidency of the European Union this year.
Lívia, a fidexed representative of the European People's Party, called attention to education segmentation as one of the main speakers of the professional negotiation, because this is also the most serious obstacle to the violation and enforcement of the Roma children.
The high-level conference, on behalf of the French Presidency, was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equality.
Among the governments, European social partners and the most important representatives of European law enforcement and civil society organisations have been invited to the consultation.
Vehicles, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, warned that, in addition to the discrimination encountered in employment, the Romas are mainly required from the labour market by their low school population.
"The majority of Roma youths do not have a secondary degree, and due to poor quality basic education, they can only have an insignificant part of higher education."
It also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children can be a strengthening of the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
It is necessary, according to the representative, to inform these links in the widest circle - including between Romans and non-Romans -.
As soon as the Roma student starts school, the chances of becoming productive members of the labour market are growing; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid after income and consumption.
"Romans should have the right to ensure their right to quality education and ensure the eradication of their low-quality and separate education," Lívia said.
The representative believes that the European Union's objective and action-oriented concentration is necessary to speed up school desegregation processes immediately and that it is essential to properly comply with existing and planned anti-discriminatory directives.
“We need to break the devil circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment, and give Roma children the opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen,” he demanded.
In the European Year of Equality, the European Equality Csúcs, which has been held annually since the last Berlin meeting, aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: grace for temporary time
At the end of October, they decide on the destiny of the leperplated Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite the rude electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, so far at the Champion CSU’s tops, the discussion of personal issues has been overlooked.
Departor Erwin Huber and Governor Günther Beckstein may still remain in place, questioning how long the grace lasts.
The 17% catastrophe loss tandem’s fate will be decided by an extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
A lot of criticized couples have been perceived: they do not hold on to all their strengths.
This attempted to reduce the angered members of the group and the base, who, once a day after the "bajor tsunami", demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, even with Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his track, the Christian Social Union gained 60.7%, and now, a year after the squad of Stoiber, only 43.4% of their strength.
For 46 years, CSU was a "unit ruler" of 18% of the German GDP in Bavaria.
Conservatives continue to be highly counted for the Hungarian economy in the central southern region, in the future it will be forced to coalition.
As one of the first signs of the inward reorganization, Vice President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture will also be placed in the narrow detective team, which starts negotiations with the liberal FDP and the Free Electors organised along the right-wing values on a possible coalition of the Munich government.
The strange finator of fate is that on the list of Free Electors, the Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber, was exploited as a pair of defeats by Huber-Beckstein, and then unrestrictedly dealt with the prominent government politician.
The CSU leaders are now turning all their energy to stabilize Beckstein somehow.
Stoiber, the former Head of State and former President of CSU, also called the hardest day of political career on 28 September.
On Monday, Huber released some steep comments to the CDU, he said they deserved much more support from the couple.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
In September 2009, following the Bundestag election, Merkel cannot be a Chancellor if CSU plays a significant role in national success in 2005.
Merkel, who is very disappointing about the sonsco, said that the loss of CSU soil will not negatively affect the big coalition in Berlin.
Which, of course, is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
The SPD has achieved the weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukasenko Explorer: 110-0
No opposition member entered the White Russian Parliament after Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by the welfare and stability of the country led by Alekszandr Lukasenko, but according to the European Security and Cooperation Organization (EBESZ), the irregularities committed in the process of voting.
The EBESZ, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the 10 million-dollar country's law for ten-dollar nations in many decades impedes the opposition, before yesterday's elections, the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) had seriously hoped that Lukasenko, a quarterly renewing the presidential mandate of the 2006 debated pure elections, would “persuade” some opposition representatives to appear in Parliament.
The ODSZ also stopped from the pre-balanced boikot.
In the background of opposition's expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which has credited for a constantly degrading Russian gas imports and contributed to the delivery of Beltransgaz gas pipelines across the country into the Russian hand - wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, where, due to the political orientation of Belarus, Lukasenko and several high-ranging politicians, were not eligible for entry.
Firstly, the EIB pointed out that, when assessing the election campaign, the EIB emphasised positive moves rather than shortcomings, such as the third of the opposition candidates.
However, the fast report of the ECSC on Monday has already objected to the campaign - in which the opposition candidates could not be seen in the press in the essence - and in particular that the opposition could not be present in the recording of votes.
In addition, the opposition believes that there is still a sensible improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been freed, and Minsk is willing to smaller confront Moscow, denying the recognition of South Ostetia and Abházia, which has been dismissed from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus is a federal state on paper, has been considered independent for one month now.
- We have taken two steps forward, one behind, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said to our page Alekszandr Milinkevics.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remain, despite the fact that "power was frightened to allow an opponent to enter the weightless parliament."
The opposition does not intend to deliver prohibitive actions in view of the results, rather to the voters on the need for economic reforms.
- Of course, we have a lot of problems, and the opposition papers must be printed in Russia, impeding barriers to dissemination by local authorities, but I can see that more and more people support change, including among the elderly, said Milinkevics, pointing out that Lukasenko’s regime, which considers the main result of social security, even the layer of most officially supported pensioners, is not appropriate.
- The country's debt, due to the increase in the trade deficit, is a matter of time of breaking the social security of the "dead silence" by Milinkevics.
In contrast to opposition politicians, Russian observers have classified the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebegyev, head of the mission of the Community of the Independent States, said to the Russian news agency Ria Novoszty, "not the words, but the actions," so the lack of opposition is evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: " Breakfast only before working time"
In the history of Chigi Palota there were unique rotating doors for the recruitment and entry of workers.
From this day on, this new measure will apply to the agents, to filter out those who block, and then go for a coffee in working time.
Renato Brunetta, Minister of Administration, and Secretary-General of Prime Minister Masi, presented the anti-solar news today.
"The wheelchairs - said Brunetta - serve better and more efficient work, reducing shortcomings and increasing services."
"The new, more responsible and more transparent period will come.
This is the real reform," Brunetta stressed.
With Chigi Palace, all the buildings of the Council of Ministers are completed.
Masi says "the installation of the wheelchairs is also important from a symbolic point of view".
The secretary-general confirmed: "The employees approved the measure, everyone collaborated."
There is no more coffee and brilliance in the morningtime.
Brunetta smiles: "A good capuccino morning at 7:00, can do miracles."
the Roman Public Administration College
At the meeting, the minister explained: “In three months, 50 percent of the shortcomings in the public sector have been reduced because of the disease, which represents more than 600,000 employees in one year.”
He added, however, that it would need to be more efficient in the Italian public administration.
"The wage dynamic of which, according to the minister, was twice as much as the private sector in the past 8-10 years, and well exceeded the inflation rate."
At the same time, thousands of public applications gathered, joining the submissions supported by the Italian Environment and Consumer Protection Organization to object to the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"When the Minister of Administration boasts of data supporting the reduction of shortcomings due to disease, the war of “unfair sunstorms” is constantly increasing," writes the Consumer Protection Association.
Thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff gathered across Italy to send wars to the unlawful rules of the regulation."
The regional administrative court is opposed, inter alia, to the erasure of supplementary nutrients, to the length of residence of workers in sick leave at home, which means the period within which the patient visitor may appear and several other aspects provided for in the new provisions provided by the minister.
Workplace accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything.
There are 2.500 work accidents in Italy every day, with 3 deaths and 27 permanent disability.
According to the workplace accident insurance data, almost 1.200 deaths were reported in 2007.
Numbers witness the seriousness of a phenomenon which is still one of the most common causes of death and demands almost twice as many victims as murder.
Today, Anmil hosts 58 times the day of job accidents held in all the counties of Italy, traditionally on the second Sunday of October, to draw attention to this dramatic problem by institutions, social organisations and public communications.
"The worrying data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, are underlined that there is a very important role in preventing work accidents," Giorgio Napolitano, President Pietro Mercandelli, sent to the President of the National Association of Baleseti Rokkantak, said.
The Head of State has sincerely referred to the "sustainable commitment of the association to the prevention of the workplace, the protection of the interests of workers suffering from the accident, the help of family members of the victims and the dentalisation of public opinion".
"The tragedies of this nature, and the tragedy of public opinion, which are genuinely shared by everyone, are in the face of such a kind, in their sizes, are also intriguing the interest of the media and the public, but in reality, we must face dramatic, repeated and repeated cases every day."
Napolitano openly admits: “We are desperately struggling with the lack of resources, and financing education and information is crucial.
In particular, initiatives within the school are essential to direct awareness of young people at the threshold of entry into the world of work.
Our duty is to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to the social importance of the issue, and to have more effective legislation that should be put into effect.
Gianfranco Fini, the president of the under house, stressed on his part, "that the work accidents ending with death have a serious social significance, and the institutions are required to end this as soon as possible."
"The data on accidents at work show a mild improvement, but the number of deaths of such kinds is still incredibly high," Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmil, said.
“We don’t want this decreasing trend to be duplicated, because the biggest tragedies occur at the moment of attention.
“We believe that at the general level we still do not do everything to overcome the phenomenon that could be solved through a complex action programme.
In our opinion, stricter supervision and control should be needed - stressed by Mercandelli - and more remarkable intervention in the field of labour training, starting from school education."
“We also need further efforts to inform and dental public opinion,” he added.
What would be most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment against a phenomenon that represents a social problem.”
After that, Mercandelli criticised "the gradual deterioration of the compensation grid for victims of accidents at work" and the "aid direction towards which the system has been rising in recent years".
"The goal is therefore to give back the safety of the workers, because the fate of the victims of the accident can not depend on where the legislators are arbitrary and where their dividing measures are."
MP3 players can cause hearing damage
Continue hearing damage can be caused by listening to portable player devices for longer and high volume, such as MP3 devices -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the Scientific Committee on New and Recent Health Risks (SCENIHR), referred to the opinion published today.
"The opinion reveals that 5-10% of people who are listening to a high volume of music players for more than an hour per day for five years can be read in the explanation.
“It’s worrying that young people who use high-powered portable music players and mobile phones in mass and practice are not aware that they can irreversiblely harm their hearing,” Meglena Kuneva said.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk that we need to respond urgently," the EU Commissioner added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and widely disseminate information about them.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can work with proper efficiency and keep up with the latest technologies.”
Brussels called on the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the spread of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people caused by them.
"The researchers confirm that there are reasons for concern, and the European Commission is ready to examine, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, the possible measures to be taken to protect children and young people who are born with the voice of portable players and similar instruments," he said.
The current European Security Regulation sets out in 100 dB the maximum level of noise that can be issued by the portable music players, however, with increased concern to accompany the data on hearing damage caused by the excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise, which can significantly reduce those hearing damages.
In its opinion of the EU's Scientific Committee, it states that in those users who listen to music with high volumes (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, noise is higher than the current maximum value for work noise.
If someone listens to music for a longer period of time, there is a risk of permanent hearing damage after five years.
This affects about 5-10% of the users using the portable device, which can also represent 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno, set up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
Today begins until March, results are expected in June.
This agenda was set by the Capital Government for the operation of the Committee on the future of the capital city of Rome, which sat together this morning at the new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Members of the Commission will develop Rome's directives.
After the end of March, the public meeting and the municipal committee will evaluate the study and plans for the adoption of the capital strategic plan officially approved by the Municipality and the Prime Minister Gianni Alemanno in June.
"This is a completely independent committee in which all political, social and cultural ideas represent themselves - stresses Alemanno's task to develop proposals for the ideas of development in Rome, which political decision-makers can rely on, therefore, on, the General Assembly and the Municipality Committee.
There is no jurisdictional conflict of interest, we only wanted a platform where great plans for the benefit of Rome could be born.
In March, after his work, the Committee will be distributed because it has a mandate for a determined period of time.
In June, we submit a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the future of the capital of Rome - the Prime Minister said.
Those who consider the Commission to be inexcessive, refraining that the opinion it has no compensatory power, Alemanno responds: “Everything depends on what work the Commission will do and on the quality of proposals on the table.
If the quality proves appropriate, as in the case of the Attali Committee in France, which I am confident in Rome, it will play an important role in its contribution.
The power of politics is often fragmented in the management of daily matters and in dealing with urgent cases from time to time.
On the other hand, we look farther and plan longer and work committed to the development and future of Rome.”
Rome’s Mayor wants to point out that “this Commission is not regarded as useless waterheads, as it is not fully free to reach the euro of Roman citizens, it serves as an incentive for thought and aims to involve the most outstanding minds of the capital.”
According to Alemanno, “There is a need for an open and flexible strategic framework that enables our city to jump on the quality that he would need so much, thinking about his future in a united spirit.”
From the future, the Mayor of Rome stresses: “It will not only be limited to the current municipal frameworks, but consider it far further,” we see not only the future metropolist and the capital status, but also “the role that you can play as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean region.”
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known, independent American politician wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
It was the first Jimmy Carter who decided to destroy the American economy with his decisions, and he cared for close relationships with the enemy Islam (as it is a private man today).”
As the time of the election is approaching, attacks against Obama are dense.
A Miami lady wrote on the internet: “This man is full of ambitions.
Obama believes in an unprecedented way that you can gain the highest public dignity of a nation whose two governors and five senators were black so far!”
These attacks are actually nothing-speaking; of course they are racist, but they don’t answer the voter’s question whether it will be a good president. Then there are public opinion research: Obama will win, and it will make a significant increase.
In this case, there is someone who listens to his emotions and not to his mind.
In the inside of the South States, a mississippi newspaper wrote in his headline article: we know well that in the voterabin, the true American national who voted.
An American way of thinking appears here that remains hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk about what you want, and we know where we're going to put the twins, Obama or McCain."
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they leave the United States.
These words have never been said until the black candidate’s success is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all the intelligence, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush's office? 89 percent answered that Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation has lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and they were so downstairs that he flew home.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack it.
However, the majority believe that Iraq was a weak spot of Bush.
It's a great job for the man who's in position to George W.
USA: The economic collapse is already felt by journalists, the time of the presses has come. Many people blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW Research Institute asked 500 American journalists how they think about their future position and spiritual power.
Well, now almost every journalist is a pessimist for his own future.
However, it was not clearly claimed that their concerns were reduced in terms of authenticity.
They don't feel as isolated as before.
The problem of American journalists is money.
They believe that the 2008 crisis is a bankruptcy of an inefficient economic model.
There are more serious problems with the newsroom, i.e. restrictions on journalist editors.
If we don’t want traditional journalism, in the sense that the great public has understood in this sense, to minimize this problem, it has to be solved by the journalists asked.
Today, well-known and complex pessimism characterizes American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior leaders working in the printed press are convinced that national zsurnalists are on the wrong path.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in top leadership position.
Printed against electronic press.
It is not difficult for the press staff to see where the world network is going.
The biggest publishers break their way to the Internet, many of which are thought to be the murderer of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" identified by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 asked journalists acknowledged that he would put a vox next to technology in the hope that it might be for the benefit of zsurnalistism.
Today, in the U.S. press industry, there is a break between editorial leaders, i.e. the directors and the reporters working for them.
At national level, 56% of leaders are sure that their correspondents share their information with others, while at local level this rate can only be achieved by 23%.
Some of them are linked to this certain job.
At national level, 47% of leaders are afraid to lose their job within three years.
In the case of journalists, this proportion is 30 percent.
In America, the question of "confident work" is constantly on the agenda (for our editors, szerk.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have a contract.
In the case of a huge nation such as 300 million residents in the United States, where thousands of newspapers, newspapers, radio, television and Internet service providers work, employers usually recommend as much as they want, so the matter "when or not need to work" is based.
The directors usually receive a high salary, and the editors can earn ten thousand dollars per month, in addition to the pension and health insurance fee.
Freedom works quite a complicated principle: in the first year x days, in the third, until it reaches the maximum 15 days after a certain period.
But the American journalists, according to their own statement, often “was sick” during the year.
Everything depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROMANIC REPUBLIC: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATA MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Council of the Court of Rome, rejected Danilo Coppola’s request for his residence from Grottaferrata to a Roman apartment.
Coppola is under investigation due to economic bankruptcy, in the context of an investigation on the Unipol-BNL stock exchange agreement.
Last week, during the procedure against him, the home arrest was dissolved and changed to a residence ban for Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, were asked to visit the property specialist from the rural town to the capital apartment.
However, according to the Court, these gases (for which the prosecutor made a rejection proposal) would allow the company to influence and access the evidence brought against it.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House did not vote for the 700 billion dollar rescue package presented by the White House: most of the Americans were more interested and still interested in the punishment of Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is also underlined by the New York Times yesterday, which informs the fact that the current crisis has caused a breakthrough within the Republican Party, showing an increasing division between the traditional, retarded, federal and business circles and the new direction of Washington and the financial anti-financial world.
This direction was expressed critically during the introductory vote.
However, the above event is only one of the major changes that the economic transformation that is still going to signal or allow you to see, not only in the United States, but also in the whole Western world, and possibly beyond it.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, has only accelerated the long-standing phenomena that are solid in this new atmosphere and are finally in the sun.
The first such phenomenon is the re-establishment of state sovereignty, the re-establishment of the economy.
The crisis affects the banking-financial institutions, which are in close contact with the foreign, but mostly, and rather widely, people and families who live in one country, in a state.
This, however, is a direct political difficulty for those in government: what to respond to the difficulties and protests of the people who are also voters.
Thus, in economic terms, the crisis seems global, but in a political sense it is almost national.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially outside the coast: it is a fair evidence of this by the European Union, which cannot set a common political direction between different interests and different national strategies.
So everyone expects intervention from each national governments, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, but mostly the opening of funds: as in the urgent situation, only individual states have financial resources, a financial stock that can make things right.
They also have their tools and their powers to use them: in certain circumstances, they have two invaluable sources that are likely to have no other market and no international organization in such a way.
In addition, the new emphasis placed on the state of nationality by the crisis is fully consistent with the fact that economic growth in recent times is an increasingly significant factor which is closely linked to this element: this is the territoriality.
In a paradox way, while we were convinced that we had already entered the network, the world of increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was ordered to dominate the world, we had only once to notice that our future is increasingly dependent on things that are less distracted than water, crop and oil.
Things that can be transported from one half of the planet to the other, but can be fully linked to a limited area.
So whoever rules the area has a lot more batting cards than it was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
I would also go to the second new, which is a kind of breakdown line.
He who says that the area, the state, the government, and it is necessary to say: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two conflicting phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective of recognizing that a credible leadership is needed, for those who can take over the events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially economic leaders, is the total loss of credit, who have proven completely inappropriate and proven that many of them are still pre-determined.
The two together have a deeper significance and in some sense more worrying: the feeling of credit loss, patience, inconvenience and segregation, which affects the total elite of leaders in more and more Western countries.
Therefore, it seems that the population is increasingly widespread in the belief that the time of social elite at the top of this time has expired, even before their actions, experience, lifestyle, culture, the word would have made itself in the context of complexity, and societal elite is increasingly alienated from the opinion of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a concealed form, is a seamless, but strong delegation movement against the dominant division and traditional political system. This voters did not expect to “should be in the glitters” or in recent times the sudden changes in the public voice. Such as the power of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the working party in Great Britain, or the revolt of American Congress members against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right side).
It seems that the traditional elite, its parties, programs, and even its habits, its press and its renowned intellectuality are becoming less and less understandable in the university, and that is why it is increasingly less and less likely to represent what has been going on in the deeper layers of Western society. Moreover, the economic crisis is increasing, expanding and potentially able to create more and more immeasurable enthusiasms.
In spite of all this, “the riot of masses” would be an exaggeration.
But it's okay to walk open eyes at all.
We can go with a super-powered glue on the wall
With a super-powered glue to overcome gravity and walk on the wall as Spider Man.
This goal was set by several U.S. research centres and a group created by four institutions is close to the solution.
With only 2.5 square centimeters of glue, researchers managed to capture and hold a 100-pound body on a vertical wall.
The U.S. magazine TANULMÁNY - Science published some of the researchers of the Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research group has already been born from the further development of special, so-called carbon nanoputke structured materials.
"The adhesive operating principle must be imagined as a package of spaghetti-like pipe system," says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Atlanta Georgia Institute of Technology.
Researchers have drawn the idea from the foot covered by the microscopic reels of the cheque, which provides a perfect tap to the animal.
Tests carried out with different materials such as glass, teflon and shiny paper have been confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the feet of those reptiles, while “will easily be removed from the wall”, explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the dayton University’s engineering arm.
"This material can be useful as a temporary glue," Liming Dai added.
We can go on the wall, just like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think about a less impressive use than interconnecting electronic devices, because carbon nano tubes lead well to heat and electricity.
You can find more apps in the field of space research.
Superheroes can wait.
The study of MÁSIK - the University of Berkeley, California, also conducts experiments with a new adhesive.
According to the article published in American Chemical Society c., California scientists presented a hairdryer made of microfiber material that is going through self-pure during the movement on the surface, so it always gives a perfect tap.
Drugs? Fruits are prohibited.
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple.
These high vitamin-containing, especially in the summer, thirst drinks, if they are taken together with certain life-saving medicines, change their absorption, by confirming or reducing their effects. This can also lead to serious health consequences.
For the risks of co-administration of carton or fresh fruit juices and certain medicines, Professor David Bailey, London University of Western Ontario, announced: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, thus preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the patient’s health.
Grapefruit juice has already been put on the defendant’s pillow when it was found that some antibiotics, antihistamin, anxiety-reducing, heart rhythm control and nerve medications can be considered to be toxic.
Two years ago, the Italian Medicines Institute itself published the news in its official publication and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with these co-administration and to take care of what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT CSAK GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of drugs.
A long list of active substances that inhibit the absorption of grapefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
This is what Michele Carru, professor of the University of Milan’s Pharmaceuticals Department of Medicine: “This kind of discoveries are usually immediately signaled to various national and international pharmaceutical institutions who, if necessary, ensure that the information contained in the information provided by the relevant agent is changed.
Therefore, you always need to read the information about the intended medicine, and if something is not understandable, we should not let ourselves influence, but ask our doctor or pharmacist clearly,” said Ansa’s specialist.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Economy Prize
The American Paul Krugman received an economic Nobel award to analyse the territorial contexts of commercial models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old neokeynesian Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for New York Times.
Krugman is one of the strongest critics in the economic and foreign policy measures of the Bush government.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went into bankruptcy, Krugman predicted in his New York Times’ leading article that the latter event would have even more fatal consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the twin towers.
This forecast has not had little debate, it has been put into the eyes of the economist, but today we know it was accurate.
“I’m surprised and a bit shocked that in the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom, how quickly the public interest passed,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “favourable economist” and is quite aggressively distributing the criticism of the overliberalism of the Bush government.”
Open Office, the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is present today as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, an open-programmed application package, which targets wider layers from home to office users, from the administration.
After almost a year of work supervised by SUN Microsystem and volunteer developers, the new Open Office will come to the general public with several innovations: the welcome screen and the re-thinkled, less spartan user interface, it will also offer several significant news. For example, Apple Mac OS X is compatible with the operating system and supports the new format of the ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2.
The Open Office has been given special attention to the compatibility with Office 2007, so that the Open Office can open new extended Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, a few modules are specific features such as which allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files via email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into a graphic module while maintaining the site-based layout.
On this interface we can also create "hibrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with table managers or text editors.
In addition, the sharing of apps has gone through a number of developments: the table manager supports the common use of workbooks, but prevents the rewriting of each other's work. The comments of each worker are marked with different colors, which helps to identify the easier.
Some companies are already working to make some of the OpenOffice functions available on the Internet (on the cloud, on the cloud), so the final version may be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after you have been able to find English on the mirror pages since Friday, can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The program package is also available for Linux outside the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
To request, we can take the installation CD in our home or at our workplace.
With regard to the spread of the home application, freedom is probably the biggest attraction, but the Open Office program package is now trying to play balls in the business sector, as it can count on many administrative and school projects.
There are no ideal education, advice and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open new business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-adapted text editor; Calc, Excel-replaceable table manager; Impress, Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase is the best known Access database manager; and ultimately Draw the graphic module.
The aim of 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads. But if we consider that the new version is already at 3.600,000, this number will probably be higher than the expected.
The result of Kohl is positive, this is the fourth dopping case.
At the latest stage of Tour de France, one of the participants, who competed in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, produced positive samples, Bernhard Kohl, Austrian Bernhard, who also won the best mountain leader with my bronze.
The news was on the website of the Equipe Internet newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor, Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol, as well as German, Gerolsteiner, who produced a positive result of the third generation version of the EPO.
The blood sample of Kohl, similar to the tests performed in the last weeks, has been studied by laboratory laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-malabry.
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera result, Austria loses its third position and prohibits competition for two years, according to the requirements.
The third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Dopping Agency, and announced by the Associated Press news agency: he indicated the positive dopping results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians managed to stand behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and won the best-minded dock.
DOES THE NEW YORK TIME FLOWER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPONSIBILITY?
Italy has only recently become one of the most popular destinations of immigrants who have been retired.
This is why the "Belpaese" racist nation is transformed into a racist nation? This is the question of New York Times, based on the young Burkina Faso Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered last month in Milan, because he stole a box of cookies - a long article on the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well characterized by what New York Times is called the "paradox of the nobles": in the northern regions, "the strongest integration and the highest employment" is the support of the "immigration and the North League" in this country.
To support increased tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also calls for cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws required by League, which would bring the gynecologist closer to immigration and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants, were presented as an example of the mood change in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the Papa and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano met Beneds in the Quirinale Palace XVI, and assumed that the state and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students are suffering from expensive rental fees, even €900 a room can cost
The market for hotels issued to universities is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest Survey of Sunia, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already spent so amazing sizes that, due to the total costs of the families, is blocking the wide layers of students from the possibility of learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of Sunia's study office. "The high demand in these cities has distorted the market so much that a general process of excitement has begun against local residents."
In most cases, the property offers also include a series of irregularities: non-registered, non-restricted contracts, linked to subsidy.
Sunia believes that it would be necessary to take an exceptional measure that gives the possibility to maximise prices through the review of the tax system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, around Brianza, there are also 450 euros for a bed; the price of a single room is from 650 euros (Bande Nere) to 800 euros ( Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) on average, but it can reach 900 euros (Vittorian neighborhood).
In Florence, an average bed is 350/400 euros, a room is about 700.
In Bologna, where students live in a neighborhood near the university, a bed place cost 250/280 euros if it is double and 370-500 euros if it is a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), a single and 450 bed is requested for a double room.
Somewhat cheaper (550 euros a single room) are prices around other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
All can be saved in the suburbs: a bed cost 300 euros and a 450 single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, there are 300/450 euros for a bed room for a room from 400 to 600 euros. The highest rate in the area of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, there will be 250/350 euros for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are even lower in absolute value, but represent greater weight within the city's büdös.
In cities such as Perugia, where students outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another abnormality: the rental fee from foreign students is approximately 25-30% higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, old Cinema Paradiso, the time of old cinema rooms in the cities
Traditional movies are closed for Multixes.
"A city where there are no movies, blind city, is like a face without eyes."
The images made by the director of Giuseppe Tornatore are shown efficiently in all that occurs in the Italian capitals, but also in rural areas.
Prevention of the cinema - the appearance of the large multitermic cinema in the suburbans, and as a result, the storm of one-termers in the city centers - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time privately bears all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When they disappear in places filled with historical and memories, “it’s like a friend who has shared our path and many experiences,” says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which was an Oscar award twenty years ago, and the Grand Prize of the Cannes Festival, tells the story of a small-town cinema lirian, after a movie that may have lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data provided by Anec, is clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional theatres have been closed. The biggest loss of the cinema in large cities was booked: 10 film theatres have been closed in Florence, 9 Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 Torino, and 5 Palermo.
Among the most affected regions, Emilia-Romagna has lost 82 single-term cinema, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that for their disappearance, the number of multiple cinemas in Italy has not been more responsible than the highest in the three regions of Italy: in the last five years, the number of rooms increased in Lombardia, 81 in Toscana and equally in Emilia-Romana.
"The number of units in Italy has increased in an irrational way," said President Anec Paolo Protti. "We are building new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of the existing ones, because when a city cinema closes, not all those who are there are willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the uncharged financial funds intended to support operators: the state's debt may be around EUR 10 million.
It is also ecologically and morally shameful that the government does not comply with the applicable legislation.
It would require €16-18 million a year to maintain the market."
This is the first Italian city that has decided to solve the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and benefits for the public to promote accessibility: viewers may enter restricted zones and park a discount tariff in certain parking areas.
"He does this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even with other measures, will follow Bologna's example.
However, it is also certain that traditional movies, so that they can fight with the rule of multiplexes, need to improve sound and image quality, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
To protect the traditional cinema, it was always an important question for me: closing Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the skirt, which led me to finally doing the Cinema Paradiso, although I've been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I'm going to the via Nazionalen before the closed Rialto or Quirinale, so I don't see the posters black from the dust, I'd rather turn my head. I've had so many experiences here."
Straight fibers between politics and 'ndrangheta, arrested Mayor Gioia Tauro
"Gioia Tauro's mayor supported the interests of the Piromodel clan in municipal decisions."
The Chairmans of the Anti-Maffia Board of Calabrians, Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Rosaro Mayor Carlo Martel, who were arrested in the morning by the accusation of external involvement in the criminal co-operation.
Bilincs was put into the hands of Gioacchino Piro model, senior intermediary between the clan and public administration, and a lawyer named a nephew who was previously sentenced to participate in a mafia-like crime cooperative, and a compensation of EUR 10 million.
"The lack of any legal and moral rule, more than good taste," the prosecutors wrote. The two local governments have expressed their intention to pay a consultative fee to Piromodel attorney.
"This would have been the official visit of the clan to the city hall, which would have given us a further opportunity to control and manage public administration, which could already be significant.
Agazio Loiero, Chairman of the General Assembly of the Calabrian Region, does not hide that there is a number of co-plays between local institutions and organised sub-worlds in the region: there are areas where the spread of mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where the co-play will not be avoidable.
However, many local politicians are resisting the 'ndrangheta pressure, they are the heroes who remain clean.'
The continuation of this morning's arrests in July, when the police announced that the Piromodel clan was finished.
At the end of April, local politicians were released from their mandate to manage the municipal government. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was once dissolved, even because of the alleged mergers between organised crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Mayor of the Christian Democrat in the Dissolution, came to the edge of the right-century coalition in the second round of 2006.
He cried at Botrane when the County Council ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
He called on the Court of Justice to Vice Minister Marco Minnin at the time and accused him of planning everything with a political purpose. However, in the arrest order signed this morning, the court stated that the Piromodel clan was dared to require the change of the A3 project.
The hearing against Dal Torrion reveals - the prosecutors writes - that "they were inclined to comply with the demands of a large group of entrepreneurs who were well-known to the Piromodel family, to subordinate the government's decisions to the clan interests."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come.
An inexhaustible energy source that accounts for 70% of the surface of the planet, and what is discovered by large international energy companies.
Hulls, sea floods, floods, and renewable energy sources for which giants like Chevron are now trying to put their hands on.
They've been looking at the possibility of getting energy from the sea movements for hundreds of years. In the '70s, during the first oil crisis, research has increased.
By 1980, when the price of oil fell, the idea of exploiting marine energy was misleaded, but today the rise in the demands of environmental protection and the price of oil is a new momentum for the industry.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) 2007 estimates that 15% of the world’s electricity demand could be covered by facilities that make use of sea waves.
This amount is twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be the flows and wirelessness.
The giants are in the ground.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to sea energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant to be established in Northern Portugal.
It seemed a revolutionary step when the signature was declared.
Two years have passed since, and more and more companies have taken voks alongside maritime energy, including those who have been dedicated to traditional energy.
"The Chevron explores the technologies that exploit the energy of the oceans and considers the possibility of collaborating with us," announced a spokesman of one of the American oil giant companies, the Wall Street Journal's economic newspaper.
The cooperation in question relates to obtaining the authorisation required for the launch of the Alaska project for the exploitation of marine energy by the US Energy Committee.
This is not a minor matter, especially if we consider that the US is currently producing oil in Alaska and that President Bush has recently launched a plan for additional drillings.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey Ocean Power are also the way of energy from the sea. The amounts invested so far, as much as you can know about the details, prove an increasing interest.
Technology is waiting for development.
According to experts, this is still an initial technology, and it is only because the energy from the sea does not dissipate doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities, such as Portugal or Scotland, are all small sizes, so there is no too big problem with ecosystem.
However, in order to produce energy at a higher level, there is a need for installations that have more environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a connected boja system.
The pushes raised by the waves and moving the buckets are transformed into a hydraulic pressure of plungers and cylinders.
Pressure turns a turbinet, which feeds a generator.
The electric power reaches the land on the wireless cables of the sea.
There are also four similar installations in the planning phases that are only waiting for federal permission. Some of the generated energy would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power has already started energy production for a shopping centre and a parking lot using six underwater turbines located in the New York East River.
When the water moves, it turns the laptops of the turbines, and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant has announced that he has a long list of partners who are only waiting for permission to use energy.
It's flooding after the lights.
Currently, the options that can be exploited through the hydraulic are deserved to be distinguished.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, the wire is more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves, so it is considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the other coastal states spent $7.5 million in 2008 to exploit the energy provided by the electric vault, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
