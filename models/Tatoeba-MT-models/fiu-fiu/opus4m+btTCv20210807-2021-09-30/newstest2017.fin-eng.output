28-year-old cuisine was found dead at the shopping center in San Francisco
The 28-year-old kitchen master who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the local shopping centre’s stairway this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he doesn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and he says, “He’s finally done well.”
The body that was found at the Westfield Mall shopping centre on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old sanfranciscola Frank Galician, called the San Francisco Death Investigation Agency.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was determined to be a murder and that the investigation is underway.
The victim’s brother Louis Galicia told ABC’s channel to KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a linestokk in Boston, had received his dream job as a linet kitchen master of the Sanfrancisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters’ representative said they were “astonished and shocked” because of his death.
“We have a small team that works like a tight family, and he will be missed hardly,” the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed at the hostels, but recently, “they finally went well.”
"He found the apartment and met a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galic said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was good-willing and had a great heart.
His way of feeling coherence with the family was to make us food, to do dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who drove with the power.
“In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a skied diamond that shines more brightly every day,” he said.
All who have information about this are asked to call the San Francisco Police's clue line at 415-575-545-444.
Doctoral trainers to strike: Requirements for new work fight measures
The representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade union to adopt new work fight measures in their dispute with regard to the new agreement.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) asks the Council as a whole to support new working measures since the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to address the concerns of the agreement.
Doctors and doctors voted in July to reject the agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of the voters rejected it.
On Thursday night, in a letter published by Twitter to members of the JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained “singlely silent” on issues that he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said, "In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject a completely proposed new agreement and demand formal re-negotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today formally requested the BMA Council for a special meeting in order to obtain authorisation for the progressive and expanding work programme in early September.
The debate has shown that medical trainers have participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete workout in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of BMA medical practitioners, Dr. Johann Malawana, divorced after the vote was rejected, the terms recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before voting by 54,000 doctors and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will be ordered to the English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external association?
Ele, which ended with the crisis.
On Tuesday, Russian and Turkish leaders met each other to hand and to declare the eight-month battle of words and economic sanctions was officially ended.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of Peter’s palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
Yes, it was at an opportunity.
But Putin’s smile looked like a crowd, and he did not threaten the heat, even according to his own controlled standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, constantly spoke of his “love friend” Putin, five times according to a report.
I'm confused with the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the level prior to the crisis, but even better.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing evil had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the vileys radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane at the border of Syria.
The reaction of Moscow was mad at the time.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow on his back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the state led to a stunning, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turkishs were blamed for everything.
The most serious was the accusations of high officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade from Syrian regions controlled by Ishis.
He has denyed this hardly.
But in Peter’s official message, it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology requested by President Erdogan.
Russia gained some kind of victory.
The benefits of concluding a harsh armor are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all potential friends after he was almost removed from power in the failed revolution last month.
Continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motivation.
The Russian economic sanctions have been heavy, especially a ban on order flights that usually carry several millions of Russian seats on the Turkish coast annually.
The amount has fallen by almost 90%.
With regard to Russia, local travel operators and ordering airlines will certainly be easier when the flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late semester attack on the Mediterranean.
And already this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after importing agricultural products from Turkey is permitted again.
"You traveled there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemosti report formulated.
But the visit also had political added value to Moscow.
We are angry with the West about what is considered as a weak answer to the attempted revolutionary attack.
Upon adding a long-standing fountain to the progressive EU membership negotiations, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of coolness and worrying Turkey’s ties to the Western countries.
The Russian leader was sure to get off-sites from Ankara, where he called after the revolution attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a survivor to Moscow, who has a deep rooted fear of the exchange of power.
So this meeting in the Pramean coastal pool enabled the "external association" presented by Russia and Turkey, as an analyst described the situation for me: two countries who experience the Western countries who rejected them and treated them wrongly, combining their forces.
However, these two have major disagreements despite public agreement.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of the peace maker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a lot of talk that after almost three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed it.
The President of Turkey was consciously avoided from answering the question in relation to their disagreements, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostileness, and taking into account the possibility of a full disaster in a NATO member of Turkey, when shooting down a Russian combat plane, it is better that two leaders are still in speech.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from external customers in Scotland
According to the CEO of the Bank, the RBS brand is reduced to the back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from external customers in Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the international objectives of the Bank.
After the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and it had to be saved, it has abandoned these objectives.
The Bank’s Strategies have used the RBS brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used for international sport sponsorship, Six Nations rugby from Wimbledon to Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to become a priority.
Royal Bank of Scotland is used with Scotland customers, but it will not be started again.
All RBS references in England and Wales are converted into NatWest, with the exception of the main office and stock market lists.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed with customers and staff at Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand becomes the employer of our investor brand and employees because we become a lot more brands.”
When the bank became a global brand, the RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it does not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has increased the profile of various brands in their sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to move towards the bank of brands, because basically (we are asking questions) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank to customers and offered these brands.
But with the work that we have done focused on customer needs, not our own, I think you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Predilection and achieves 3000 wins
Dettor showers champagne after he has 3000 wins after double wins
Frankie Dettor, the skirist, secured his 3000 British win in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached a verstack at his second victory on his way home, competing with the predilection of John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches this milestone in the race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The Triple Master Jockey Dettori, who won the Ghayyar before, said, "This is special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a normal Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettor absorbs the hurricane when he takes Predilection out after the victory.
Two competitors have reached this verstack at the frontier competitions - Master Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-fold master Sir Anthony McCoy, who had records of over 4300 wins in his career.
Lester Piggot, 9-fold Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racers in the present era, and it’s not surprisingly surprisingly that he has reached this milestone that few have achieved before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical bull separates him from the other weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and karism have been dragging fans into the species for years.
I told Frankie in Epsom a few weeks ago that he would have ridden 6000 winners if he wasn't just the jockey of the weekend and the big races!
Speaking seriously, Frankie has ridden the winners in the UK most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a vibrant person who is good for British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated a milestone to the trademark by landing a drone from the saddle.
Flying off to drone landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of the British race for two decades.
It's been a mountain track.
A lot of profits in big races, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aeroplane accident and suffered the ban on competition due to drugs.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after six months of ban on competition, but he showed a significant nature when he challenged the suspects and returned to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin Sergei Ivanov
Suddenly, Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted insider for many years.
63-year-olds have now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport Affairs.
The Kreml opinion said that Putin has ordered Ivanov to move away from the positions of the Head of the Russian Presidential Administration, but this was not justified.
Assistant director of Ivanov, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor since 2012.
The persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, completed the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he led the president's protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the main task of the administration is to support your activities as a Head of State, as regards the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that persecution be appointed to his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, operated in the Soviet security service at KGB.
He was one of the most influential men in the country.
Both men in the state television meeting with President Putin claimed that the Head of State retired from their own request.
But despite the smiles of the cameras, only few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this just some sort of power fight?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement that a man who was once advertised as a potential president’s candidate, suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy, has been very doubtfully adopted.
In his comments quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, “It’s true that early in 2012, I asked you to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, if you could even say to your workplace, the task.
Well, now I've been head of staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He was formerly Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service in KGB, as well as Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was a leader in the state security service at the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his Vice-President.
When Putin came into power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could come after the second period of Russian President Puti, as the third season of Puti would have been contrary to the Constitution.
However, this task went to another nearby ally of Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became the Prime Minister before his return to President only three and a half years later.
The Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got his shoes after he hit the producer.
Gibson was involved in the physical dispute last month at the location of the series in Los Angeles.
The series producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced their separation in the joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner filed his apology on Thursday before his resignation was reported.
There were creative differences and disputes.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details about how Gibson's character is removed from a series of FBI agents are expected later.
The 54-year-old of Dharma & Greg’s situation comedy has been involved in the series since its first period in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it all my last twelve years,” said Gibson in the opinion published on Friday.
I had hoped to be with you until the end, but it is not possible now.
I just want to thank the authors, producers, actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans that the series can have.
The beginning of the twentieth production period has been scheduled for September 28.
Mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banff
A man living in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish that the watercycle has left behind.
A Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing University: The Bridge is now reaching Fifeen
1.35 billion pound project is expected to be ready by May 2017
The engineers have combined the northern cover of Queensferry’s crossroads, both in the landscape, which means that the bridge is now reaching Fife.
It is the first of the four seals between the "citizens' threats" that are now graduating around each of the three pillows of the bridge.
The bridge share of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of furnace.
The project of 1.35 billion pounds is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economics Keith Brown visited the country today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry crossroads.
We are all witnessing a really impressive engineering work in this project, using more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge."
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, the finalisation of the feather between the landscape and the bridge cover is a demanding operation in which extreme precise dimensions must be agreed.
Overall, almost 79% of the bridge cover is now in place and the final part of the cover is lying today in Rosyth, which means that the whole cover is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Chief of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructionors, said: “The first closure in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this closure represents the top of building technology.
When the last part of the road cover was installed and combined with the expanding North Pole road cover, then we had to close the remaining part of the north, i.e. the inside country, on the side.
This was done by pulling the north road to the land bridge of 700 millimetres south.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
It is huge because it is 222 metres long, weighing about 6000 tons, and it had to be pulled around 3% in the fall angle.
Demandful because the allowed deviations that the team worked were small, only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, however, everything went well.
Salvation in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy when they’re alive”
Three men are “fortunately alive” after they fell from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station alarmed at 13.20 (BST) Friday after the crew saw the event in the Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim in security when their boat continued to move on to themselves.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the director of Moelfre's rescue boat.
"Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got to move," he added.
The local fishing boat rescued two men, and the third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging a boy without a lifelift.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely injured.
The boat engine had a folding rope, but it had somehow removed the boat from the timed person when the boat fell.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
During the past decade, many have been worried that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but that they prefer to spend their leisure time watching displays.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and participate in some activity.
The display time was initially limited to television, then to video games, and now recently to smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and external air activity do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to a wildlife called Pokémon Go. Application based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s for video games (more recently they were created by a series of drawings, game cards and other follow-up products).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the publication of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the game was postponed in other countries because the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
Only in days, Pokémon Golla had more users than Tinder and almost as much as on Twitter.
How does it work?
As explained in the nut shell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémones, which are tracked by GPS, and which can be “footed” (with the help of the phone screenshot) or “quested”.
The generation that played the game when you were younger has joined in wildlife and jumped up from the couch to the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "central person".
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, followed by 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% in the users followed by Cardiogram.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Gota, it only sees the level of training.
Many public health campaigns have not produced any results because most public health warnings are bored and people who seem accidental.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be reduced.
Regularly, people are at a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse here.
The finest of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, raitis air and sunshine and fun.
Some people even get new friends when hunting.
As usual, the destructive cheerleaders are looking for things that complain about.
Yes, someone can walk on the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although previously there were applications like Fitbit that could be monitored for activity, they did not give the reason to move in the same way as this game.
The novelty disappears and the use is disrupted in time.
However, because of the success of Pokémon, other games will come, combining applications and virtual reality with the real world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, better and healthier.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in the multiplayer game of women's gymnastics
Forget the pressures.
Forget about publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to everything.
Energetic in jumps.
It's a smooth bucket.
Incredible permano.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnastics won the multiplayer championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in the light bowl of the Olympicians.
He had his total point, 62.198, clearly better than the team of a silver medalist and a "Final Five" co-founder Aly Raisman and a Russian pronch medalist Aliya Mustafina.
The US Simone Biles Balance Party for the Multiple Winning of Women in the Final of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The party became the fourth American woman, who has consecutively won the multiplayer championship, and in total the fifth American champion. At the same time, he strengthened his reputation for his generation, and perhaps the best of all times.
He broke into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement raises his same class with the best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Biles has ruled its species for the last three years, winning 15 World Championships, including 10 Golds, with programs that the mix of ambition and accuracy has been so stunning that in 1984, Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best to see."
The last experiment was expected in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between the burden of his and the excess expectations.
Returning a family home to Texas Spring without a big gold medal would have been a disappointment.
On the left, Simone Biles, and Aly Raisman will be huging after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) of the multiplayer match of women's teline power in the final of individuals in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, Elok.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday when he served as a top-up national team coordinator, Martha Karolyin, at the departure party.
Although Biles argued that he has never thought about the future as long as he went to the top of knowledge, it is not entirely true.
Some of his permanto programs - including his trademark extremists - are adapted to Latin American music, which would also perfectly fit the street next to the Rio Olympic Island.
This is not a coincidence.
In this girl whose grandparents adopted as a taper, and whose coach Aimee Boorman's mother found when she was on a study trip to the gym in which Boorman trained, has become a force factor.
He has not lost in a multiplayer match since summer 2013, and this winning pipe will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Blackfina was in a small leadership after two rounds, it was just a deception.
Balance Base and Permanto, in which Biles is a dominant world champion, waited.
He rose to the top at 15.433 boom points and crossed them with 15.933 permano.
Raisman huged him goodwill when they waited for the endpoints - just formality - and tears rose up into the eyes of Biles glitter red, white and blue, when the dream he once wrote his playbook was true.
Raisman’s performance was somewhat revancing from four years ago when he was divided into a third place, but lost the bronze to the Blackfina.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, called the American Grandmother, was clearly in charge.
He sent air kisses to the public after his permantance, in a feeling of return, which sometimes seemed to be questionable.
As far as Biles comes, this widely spread tweeting of the 19-year-old earlier this week will have a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial murder were shot when they listened to music in the car
During the most deadly attack of the first serial killer in Phoenix last decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, so they were told on Thursday in the police release.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on 12 June.
The news tells us that the shooter standing on the passenger of the car shot up to eight times and then escaped with the second vehicle.
According to the police, the triple death did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, because the attacker did not take any handbags or 2,900 dollars for the other adult victim.
The police officer of Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting led scientists to check if it was connected to four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks in four months, made in two main Latin American cities.
“These things happen in the residential area in front of the home,” Howard said earlier this month to the CBS subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists have not agreed to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks relate to each other and are committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, went to a hospital where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The witness told the police that they were sitting in a often parking car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on shooting only half an hour before the third death and targeted an open-package car, which is also believed to be a serial killer's job.
Scientists found shelves of bullets, bullet seats, and bullet chips in the engine space.
A 6-year-old mother with microchephalia: "Your business will be easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his age friends, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder from which his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when he was pregnant.
“When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn’t do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
What isn't true, of course I promised," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in medical care.
"My first reaction was that "I didn't know people would still do it," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walk.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl like he was only three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some verstacks.
He walks with help and drives on a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth will show you how the link Edmund's invented is "would you sing to me"?
"We teach him a sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a normal sign language, he tells me that Edmund has invented some of his own.
Microcephal may be due to a number of reasons: genetics, such as Edmund, or pregnancy virus infections such as ash or Zika virus.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those who have been infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the feeling load caused by a uncertain future.
I was just asking what would happen.
What's going on?
And he doesn't really know yet.
In fact, I haven't asked for a prediction in time because I don't expect anyone to really give me that.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
The situation will make it easier.
You can believe that the situation will make it easier.
You love your child and your child loves you.
Strong Sads and Floods caused rescue operations in Mississippi Louisiana
The harsh and widespread floods in Louisiana received the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, waiting for more rain to the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that several rivers in Southeast Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded over their umbrellas and caused a large flood due to extreme rainfalls.
Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that the state authorities are constantly in contact with the local authorities and that the assistance is already coming to the counties that need it.
The Governor’s Office for Safety and Emergency Preparation Mike Steele said that they will receive requests for lifting water vehicles, boats and sandways.
Steele said that alone in Tangipahoa county asked for tens of thousands of sandblowers.
The flood guard is valid until Saturday in most southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in the opinion that the area is expected to be between three and five cents more rain.
In the southern Alabama, the flood guard was in force on Friday when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set up a flooding record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood in several houses near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is to flood the Ascension county on the river along the river when the flooding rivers slowly fall to Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River in Lousiana Liverpool, south of Mississippi's state border, was the highest level of all time on Friday morning at 9:00.
The rescuers are still picking up people from floodwater in the Amite and Wilkinson Districts in the southern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and grandparents were near Glosteria on Friday.
62-year-old Hansford says that the water of Beaver Creek from his house was rapidly rising over 400 feet.
He said that the other, close to him, warned him.
"We woke up, and the water continued to rise," Hansford said.
It ran to my belt.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she has not seen water so high during the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members have injuries, and that he is the only swimming skill.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved the three large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that the floods “will quickly spread widely” while the hard drives continue, and that the authorities will plan evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reports 13,75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely bored since Wednesday.
The flooding of harsh and streets led to the rescue of the inhabitants of the county of Tangipahoa from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school circles, the authorities said.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipahoa a member of the City Council said 200 homes were under flooding.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but both are now under the flood.
The president of the county, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had remained the islands of the rising water.
The cities of Amite and Hammond have been opened for those who have been evacuated.
"They can return to their homes when the water begins to fall," he said.
In the district of Tangipahoa in Hammond, twenty streets were closed due to the rise of water, and the residents were allowed to pick sands to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The last major flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, the Emergency Director of the Harrison County Rupert Lacy said the steady rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday, the houses were reported to be flooded, but no flood incidents have been reported until Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives the shooting of Philadelphia.
The police say that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means shooting another six-year-old in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child told CBS Philadelphia his name Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown had several shooting wounds, including nipples, legs, hand and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," said Grandma Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the condition of the boy has been recorded critically, and several cuts have been carried out for him.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first class at the local subschool.
Brown was one of four shots in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot from the front seat in conjunction with the 29-year-old in critical state, the station reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Scientists tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there was a cross between several shooters.
Types of hysteria that originated from different attack weapons filled the event site.
It seems that it was definitely a constant struggle.
On the street there were shelves on both sides of the footwall.
“So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in an active battle,” said Philadelphia’s police chief Anthony Ginaldi.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the data received, the police are investigating surveillance camera records.
The second six-year-old girl got a misguided shot at her hand on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the neighbourhood of West Oak Lane.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is why I call the Olympic Olympics team of women this year for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three powerful players, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, will all be proud.
This team, finally, looks like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the most successful female forcer has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is great.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as the Olympic winner, and America hurried.
The world has now been able to prove the incredible performances of the threefold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, where they present unexpected but mastery performance programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman who has consecutively won individual culture in women's multiplayer.
And a teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation does not look like this in the gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all on the same path as Aly and Madiso when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (the last five), because the following Olympic team will have only four winners, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is a expensive species, and gymnastics usually practice in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (trainers and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics are located in prosperous suburban areas that can support the species.
In these clubs, gymnastics receive all their training, and this is a costly and long-term commitment for the families of gymnastics.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the gym.
We need to bring more affordable and available gymnastics training to communities with numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my racing foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (particularly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to provide high-level gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic species.
Strengthening develops the body’s strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as the greed, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health and school and work.
This team's enthusiasm makes thousands of young girls begin to gain, and it's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for demonstrating serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team, and that you motivated so many young girls coming from different backgrounds to begin on the road towards a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Medical practitioners organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped that they would terminate the changes to the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37,000 doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed the plans to force the contract, saying that NHS was on "unknown soil", and that even small delays damage staff and patients.
The first medical practitioners will be transferred to a new agreement containing changes to night and weekend work practices to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Committee of Medical Practices of BMA, said last night in the opinion: “The doctors still have serious concerns regarding the proposed agreement, especially that it accelerates the existing labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors equally.”
When only eight weeks remain before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time will be over.
BMA’s attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced the government’s unwillingness to participate and sometimes deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of doctoral practitioners.
If he does not do so, doctors are ready to continue working fights.
The last strike at the end of April meant nearly 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 postponement of reception periods when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to act as doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to terminate the changes to the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend wage with 54,000 doctors under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, called medical practitioners in order not to strike.
Mortimer said, “The work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but put pressure on teams and services that are already in demand, and cause concerns, anxiety and disruptions to patients, caregivers and their families.”
During the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of control (Guardian Role) and the manifestations (Whistleblowing).
The employers wished to continue a positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility of education, additional training, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum programme, student leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, the Health Education England Training Organization and the Ministry of Health are respecting the agreements reached with November, February and May with BMA.
Two pounds per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from two pounds per day after the authorities recommended that it be given to humans for longer periods.
A drug that inhibits blood clotting, ticagrelor, drops the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack in order to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizures.
NHS's administrator, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS's administrator, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people receive a heart attack every year in England, and one quarter of them receive a second stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are due to the fatty tissue accumulated on the arterial wall, which forms ahtam.
If the absorption breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood circulation in the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the coagulation breaks, it can pass with the blood and break the blood circulation into the brain, causing stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have increased the risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by an AstraZeneca isobritannian company and sold by trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The NICE guideline draft published today recommends that people receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the availability of effective treatments to prevent progression, even a quarter of people who have received a heart attack will later receive another heart attack or stroke, whose consequences are often destructive.”
The fear of regeneration can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective to reduce the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we initially recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased with our ability to increase the available treatment options for thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor - especially when it comes to the risk of bleeding over three years - is limited, it is not recommended that treatment be carried out for longer than during this period.
The culture of political correctness allows the flourishment of the electoral violin in Muslim regions
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed last year because of corruption, giving an impetus to the government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the disregarding of the widely spreading vote fraud in Muslim communities, being revealed today in a shocking government report.
The former Minister of Government Sir Eric Pickles alerts police, electoral officers and city councils that they have ignored the evidence of the electoral violin because of the supersensitivity of the race and religion.
The former Community secretary, the current Emperor of Anti-Corruption, said that the fear of voters on religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed to set guard chains to protect voters outside of voting places.
He recommends that voters should submit an identity certificate when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter must only say his name and address.
The report even suggests that a voter’s finger be put in an undetermined ink so that no one can vote twice.
Imprinters should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for a broader access to the press to the documents and decisions made by the informal committees or the working group.
“This would not only protect from election, but would protect local administration from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with the election violin,” he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the vote scandal of the East London Tower Hamlets.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the seated mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of many accusations of corruption and illegal action.
The court stated that Rahman “tonely distorted” his Muslim community’s religious emotions and slowed down his critics for racism and Islam’s fear.
Rahman said “had led his election campaign on the basis of the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were suspicious or resulted in the fact that a person voted as another.
Sir Eric said there's evidence in the whole country.
He expressed a particular concern in the post-voting of the election violin, where the members of the high-quality Muslim community were said to pressure people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including proof of identity with a personal certificate
He said in his report: “The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the older ones, especially in communities with a Pakistani or bangladesh background.
"The government's institutions had ignored such behavior because of the hypersensitivity of the "politically correct" race and religion."
Sir Eric presented 50 proposals for cleaning the system, including denial of political activists to deal with postal voting tickets in order to end the "collect of votes".
The report examined by Theresa May also requires more stringent amendments to registers in order to prevent the use of the election register for fraud in immigration and compensation.
Consider alternatives to demonstrating the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of an unsolved ink to make sure no one can vote twice.
Make systematic national amendments to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set the three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prevent the political activists from handling ready-to-post sounds and envelopes in which the voices are sent.
Let the police set guard chains around the voters.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of frightening under the Representation of the People Act of 1983.
Make photography illegal at voting points.
Require that voters only use English (except in Wales).
Strengthen training in order to ensure that the staff comply with the rule that the voter must go to the cab alone.
Sir Eric, you have the Great London police forces saying it's "astonishing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The jury will remain in Lutfur Rahman and his officials as a result of numerous corruption and illegal activities,” he said.
On the basis of numerous criteria, he was found guilty without doubt, according to the threshold of criminal evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective "racial screen checks" in the City Council voting offices.
Sir Eric said, "The last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a awakening.
Our nation has a magnificent heritage as a generator of parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious electoral violin spread and the prohibition of certain groups of facts threatens this good reputation."
Insanely, Kate's bike twin and other pictures of celebrity in Rio's Olympics
This week, the fans of Rion 2016 Olympics have gone confusing with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, proven to be an impressive double flight from the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting gold this summer, who can praise his own famous double being - at least according to social media.
So, for the honor of Rio’s races and all the famous faces on our screens, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympic athletes that look clearly like Hollywood’s celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: a member of the United States Men's Flexible Team, Brady Ellison, on the left, is compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's double being on the bike track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain squeeze could be a star of Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the United States Men's Flexible Team, has caused a storm on Twitter after the surface of his pictures where he seems to be scary as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, when he became aware of the agitation of social media, he admitted that he had heard of seeing Leo since his child.
“I don’t see a great match, except for a beard,” Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will also appear this year: a remarkable similarity between British long-term jumpers Greg Rutherford and popular actress Neil Patrick Harris.
Alya Blackfina’s largest, apparent eyes have been said to be a Cuban-American singer of Gloria Estefan’s double being.
And in the pool, Cameron van der Burghia, a South African swimming pool, has been compared to Matthew Morrison, the Glee star.
Bigger switch to the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "Athletic version" of the Inception actress.
Another long-term comparison has been a tennis star between Rafael Nadal and actress Josh Hartnett, both with the same strong corners and lips.
The Russian Silver Swimmer Yulia Efimova has the same actor with Annalynne McCord as a brown skin and blonde hair, while the US team Nathan Adrian reminds the fans of "Joseph Gordon Levitt's sports version".
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, sharing the same face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others saw similarities.
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a couple of similarities.
One Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that “the others on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the U.S. football star and Dexter's actress have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical with the smile of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal won by the winner Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful wide smile is matched by the Bring It On star Gabrielle's smile of the Union.
The CBC Olympic Commander presents an apology after saying the Chinese swimmer "death like a pig"
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s 4x200 metre free-switting message raged the CBC’s direct Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian TV company, CBC, had to apologize after one of its speakers said during the race the 14-year-old Chinese female mackerel "destroyed like a bad smell" and "death like a pig".
The reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was turned off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the media final of women's 4x200 metres of free swim.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC's browser to bring "color", was heard to say, "That little 14-year-old China shook you, baby.
Too excited, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
"Thank you for that."
China Swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the second part of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada Taylor Ruck, which gave Canada the opportunity to catch China.
Viewers around Canada react quickly online after shocking the language used and its voice.
Emmett Macfarlane twittered: "Did the CBC reporter just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer was "dead as a pig"?
"The idiot didn't realize he was still in a direct broadcast."
China Ai Yanhan was described in the 4 x 200 metres message final of women's free swim: "That little 14-year-old China was slapped, baby."
The review of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was heroic and fast, many challenged him.
Twitter users did not arrest themselves when they heard how irrelevant Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist gang.
Shortly after this, Scott Russell, who ran the CBC's broadcast, apologized to MacDonald's comment, saying, "We're sorry that a comment on the swim was sent.
It was a sad choice of words, we are sorry that this happened."
CBC ended up asking for forgiveness more than 90 times for people who had tweeted as a reply.
Scott Russelin, a reporter, had to apologize for MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and joined an apology for more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The company also promptly apologized and published an opinion.
We are deeply sorry that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
Last night, we quickly proceeded to the measures and apologized to our viewers and our followers in social media.
For the sake of clarity, it has to be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the bather, not as a person.
However, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry about his message.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized to the direct broadcast and tried to define his observation by noting that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
“I would like to apologize for the comment I made last night after a woman’s message,” he said in the CBC’s Olympic broadcast.
"I went to the swimmer's performance, not as a person."
“It seems unnecessary to say that I didn’t mean it to be disrespectful, and that I’m really sorry.”
Primark’s client was shocked by a woman who ruthlessly dressed underwear in the middle of the trade
Customers didn’t know where to watch a woman stripped off in the middle of Primark’s movement to try underwear.
It did not improve the fact that after assessing what she looked like in the pants, the woman peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to twist and eventually agreed four underwear in the store located in the Bouverie Place shopping centre at Folkestone.
Primark's movement at Bouverie Place's shopping center in Folkestone, where she reconciled underwear and then put them back in the shelf
At the same time, the mother of two children in the store Jenny Davidson said that after attempting underwear, a mysterious woman “weared again and walked away from the movement without buying anything.”
He said, "The people didn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of underwear, took off her own socks and underwear, and put on the adjustable legs.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for reconciliation, he just stood in it as shameless."
"Everything stared when he took off the underwear and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three couples before finally decided that he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care about who looked or thinking about a person who would end up buying the underwear he agreed."
Davidson, a 33-year-old in Kent’s town, said, “It’s hateful to think that someone will take the underwear that someone else has tried but not cleaned.”
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I asked the staff to remove clothes after leaving the woman, which is good.”
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and see that another woman has dressed them and took them off, and they have not been washed."
Primark’s representative said, “Primark is aware of the incident that took place in Folkestone on Tuesday 9 August.
All of these products have been removed from sale."
This way you can defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Krav Maga Federation, who lived in New York, in order to find out how to deal with shooting robbers in the near distance.
We either approached you from front or behind, this video will show you how to pay the attacker at the same time.
According to Mizrach, if you're approaching behind the back, you're going to have to turn to see your attacker and "rave the line of fire".
Then you grab the gun between the elbow and the shoulder before you hit the attacker on your face with your free elbow.
Continue by hitting on the knee to the nipples, and when the assailant goes into the pain, pull the gun out of his hands, hit him with a gun on the back of his face and retreat while the gun is directed to him.
If the armed person approaches the front, the technology is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal cannot trigger it.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then pull the gun from his take, back and show him with the gun.
Does that sound hard?
Watch the video exactly how Mizrach does this.
But remember, if you're not the master of Krav Maga, the safest way to get rid of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright arrows Europe's most dirty places for travel guides
The British traveler has put a serious challenge on his immune system and on his occult reflex by licking some of the most dirty and nightly locations in Europe.
From Suffolk to Suffolk, Ian Wright, 51, licking euro banknotes, narrowings in Piccadilly Circus, the train toilet certificate and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of their immune system.
Before the arrow of each object, he used a photometric to show himself and us the situation he was going to.
The experiment made by a film called Inner Power, however, produced surprising results.
The idea of rinsing the rinsing label used by thousands of people may seem completely unpleasant, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen camp.
On his way across Europe, Wright continued to talk to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him any other bad taste in the mouth.
Wright became a well-known intestinal durability tester when he travels around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task from public railway stations to the toilet to the rinse of the toilet seat really tested his immune system.
In a film he said, "I've been quite careless about my health since childhood, and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth from soil, worms, and raspberry water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample had more than 4000 units in photometers.
For the purpose of comparison, the reading of the hands of the counterwaves should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet he refused to lick when the photometric result showed more than 4000 units, and the results of the hand of the counterwaves were less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler’s film, the Inner Power, together with the Finnish Milk, Valion. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtyer than that!
I'm not gonna snooze anything because there's something to stay here.
Inner power was produced together with the Finnish Milk, Valion.
The company offered Wright the Valio Gefilus, which contains dairy acid bacteria and vitamins C and D that help improve human intestines and immune systems.
The head of the election snacks, juice and new categories said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look, and at the same time explains the probiotics' interests.
We throwed a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up thinking, "Let's put it to Ian."
They claim that interest in the health of the intestine is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell us about the good and bad bacteria of our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the intestine is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary film we can in an interesting way tell more consumers about it.
I think the document also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the document, added: “Let’s say this now, even if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him to do, like the Russian toilet that was in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him.”
Some of the arrowing things were easier for Ian, while some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows saved."
In a survey conducted in 2015, 84% of respondents combined milk acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and the intestine, 58% said that at least sometimes they use products added to milk acid bacteria.
The Huge Family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall Saltash, before deciding
The vicious family caused damage to the rental house of 50 000 pounds after they were removed because of the terrorists of the neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and his partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall Saltash since they were complained several times.
When they were removed from the property, the shocked residents of the housing company said the property was in poor condition.
The walls were made with stunning holes, the floorboards were torn, the waste was distributed on the floor and the walls were smuggled with graffites.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, host of Cornwall Housing, said he was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real nightmare for the inhabitants, and I don't think people should live this way.
Here are many things to consider, as this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is badly famous, and their name is badly famous.”
According to the police, the couple had three sons who lived in real estate, and the fear of the family was involved in a street fight with baseball lands, scary of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive screaming, arguing and screaming.
In June, Skeldon, a 47-year-old, named in the lease contract, received a decision on unsocial behaviour.
There were old waste in many houses underneath the wreck.
The property from which the drugs had previously been delivered had been swept up.
The neighbours said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing removed the property of a woman and this partner this week after giving them a extended period, 11 weeks, time to change voluntarily.
The easy neighbours thanked the decision, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived in their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
“This morning we couldn’t sleep.
We got up because we were so quiet here, we haven't been used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone."
Cornwall Housing's neighborhood executive director Adam Fitzpatrick said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property.
Waste and old toys have been thrown down on the wild walls of the rental house.
He added: “It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own and family’s behavior, because the decision is always the last way Cornwall Housing considered.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have frightened the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work of my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as the bold members of the community that gave us information.
I hope that this development will bring comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three sons all lived in real estate in different times, but they were all in twenty.
After the emergency, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
The residential company’s employees must now clean the waste surfaces surrounding the house.
In 2014, the police made a raid for real estate and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as wax, supplies and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon received fines after giving offences for the possession of B-class drug as a plan to extend it.
He claimed that the money was intended for his son Lee Skeldon's gravestone, which died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partners live homeless when they are frozen in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house had graffiti.
The police say they're trying to eliminate the residents who mock the rules of their rental contract.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall's police said that the call was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
“This is a message for those who think that their behavior is without penalties, and for those who suffer from such behavior,” he said.
Devon and Cornwall's police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial use, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a military shower flew the beach at a very low level
Sunbathing tourists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced a shock of life
The P-3C Orion airplane of the Portuguese Air Force would sweep off from a very low
Air Forces said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
Currently, the terrified tourists began to panic when the low-flyed shower was wiped across the full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft came to the near touch distance of the sunservers in the North Portugal Aveiro.
The holidayrs stood up when they began to understandably worry about the noise of the shower, even though they did not see what the clouds were coming towards them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro last afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who published videos of dramatic flights in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, “It passed twice at a very low level, and together, it seemed to be falling into the country.”
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and really felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the machine appeared from darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese air forces today said that the pilot of P-3C Orion was on a train flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the shower had flyed significantly lower than usual due to the poor visibility caused by the smoke of nearby landscapes, but the air forces assured that no one’s safety was at risk.
The landscape fires have destroyed parts of Manner-Portugal this summer, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly in low visibility due to the deteriorated conditions, the smoke caused by landscapes and the thick sum,
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats.
Extracting the result of the first half of the year better than expected
The Social and Health Circle of South Karelia (Eksote) made a better result of 3.4 million euros planned in June.
The exote result was EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where preventive services have been deployed by the development of institutional care.
The treatment warranty was implemented in all activities.
Exote is trying to shorten the lines of action this year.
Exote covers the surplus of the previously born deficit.
The excess proportion may be used to shorten the lines and buy measures for patients.
The result of the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The exoten government will discuss the half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Limits Vanished Military Light in Immola
The 70 guardians of the Border and Sea Guard school swore the military light on Friday.
The Military Valley of the Border and Maritime Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The tenth special limiting course jury was held at the sports field of the Army.
The soldier was sworn by 70 guardians.
Special frontiers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were asked for a special limit.
They were invited to 250.
Special limits have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces were involved in a veteran meeting in the event of the Vala event.
The average age of those with him is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A range of robsvos above - criminal intelligence helps detect crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police departments in Finland has been operating from the beginning of 2014 by the RTA, which is a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outwards.
The Hämeen Police Department includes four police officers in Lahd and Hämeenlinna.
It is pulled by Sergeant, placed in the gift.
He's an executive officer in Inspector Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit is a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian suits.
The unit has demonstrated its eligibility and necessity, considers the deputy police chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various investigations for the other police.
In the wedding, it has acquired information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the latest working methods
Establishing analytical units is the latest reform of police working practices.
The goal was to prevent crimes, i.e. the fact that the police would get more and less pounds in the place until they get an alarm.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where the most needed.
In addition to the reform of the police government, one criminal intelligence centre was established, less than three national units and their own criminal intelligence unit were established in each police department.
The PTR centre in the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa manages operations nationally.
PTR units work in accordance with their name from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, on their behalf, work in areas shared by the police departments and are responsible for providing information to local police forces and national units.
The intelligence extends beyond its own territory.
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12 hours of work, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police department.
The intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, as crime does.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than basic police.
The unit aims to draw attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar offences by means of registers, alert databases and observations.
This is called sequestration, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own ways to act.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it was honest or criminal.
Based on the method of doing, the factor consists of a certain image.
The setup may be carried out either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
It is not said of its own and criminal methods because it could lead to the development of professional criminals and thus attempting to prevent police offences.
The procedure is publicly reported if it expects them to threaten.
For example, this case was news from the early summer, the way of signing empty apartments used in housing breaks.
The authors put the apartment in the outside door with a stick, a button needle or a tape that they tried to see whether the residents were really travelling.
The pre-examination material is public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest will order a protocol on the right of the court, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found in the place.
Next time, the gloves go to the thieves.
For the purpose of the case, the deputy police chief Tero Seppä from Hämee, Officer Tuomo Lepolaa from the Eastern Finland Police, Officer Sami Joutjärve from Joensuu Police Station and criminal inspector Arto Tuomelaa from the Central Crimea Police.
The police are collecting and analyzing information to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last amendment was a three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
The national cooperation collects information from the outside of its own institution and Finland's borders.
A schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join Ishi, is dead in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said that the daughter's family heard this death in Syria in Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in the Russian air strike in Raqqa, which is the foundation of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, she died just when she was planning to escape the war from the land and return to Britain.
“It can only be hoped that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and a will for others that there are real risks to go to the war zone - that it could make people give up on such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Eastern Schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they went on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultanan family was told that the girl had been married to the Issis fighter in Syria, and that she only became a widow after a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland's Supreme Court candidate if he is elected.
Senate’s Democratic Director Harry Reid says he is convinced that Hillary Clinton, President of Democrats, will be appointed to the Supreme Court of Judge Merrick Garland if he is elected president.
The Republicans of Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mitch McConnell, the Senate’s majority leader, says that the next president will choose the person to be replaced by Mr Antonin Scala.
On Thursday, Reid said that he would predict "very certainty" Clinton would choose Garland.
Later, Reid’s representative said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "boat the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the U.S. Supreme Court of Appeal in District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans that prevent Garland's name are Presidential candidate Donald Trump's "handlers" and "positives".
He said Trump is not suitable for office.
Treats says that naked calendar is "for women as well as men"
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish the calendar inspired by Pirell in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they intend to find the next top model generation of 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, Chairman of Treats, told us earlier this year that his naked magazine, which contains naked images, differs from the old school of Playboy, because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this to women.
Apparently, he thinks that the calendar is for them.
“We must start to introduce the untimely and classical nakedness where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with the images of these naked female bodies,” Shaw said in the press release, where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can leave photos through the network or personally in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: Who actually buys discs?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyles.
Before you go to complete the comment with irritated insults, whose author is a nominal non-EveryYesCeski-ageMiehet, you will notice that this claim is based on real information.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of a lot of spoken records is not because more and more people born in this millennium become enthusiastic about the novelty of physical objects, but of the middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased a vinyl plate are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, most unlikely, albums are purchased in the age group of 18-24 years old.
Also, the question is not just the collection of interns, but it contains emotions: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to hold their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy their loneliness (69% vs 66%).
But do YouGov’s results be true?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me when I was walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey costume on me. I would blink brightly before I stop, form a cup of my hands and say something valuable, like, "Let's look into it more closely."
Let's take a closer look at this.
At the same time, when Soho’s charming power and dirty is slowly removed - the hotels, chain restaurants and shops as well as office cables now fill the buildings that had previously had independent movements - there are still some wonderful specialized record shops left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop photographing for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these stores, trying to evaluate by observing their age and emotional empire.
Glasgowlainen Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably twenty), spends their afternoon in London due to a meeting, and circulates shops to spend a few hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
“I am,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records that appear in the picture above (they sent the sample by email, I didn’t follow him home) cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for obtaining such a huge record and single amount is partly due to the revenues available to him: now he can buy discs that he could not afford when they were originally published, and he can rebuy the ones he sold when he was young and unfaithful.
"A large part of the material I purchased is late in the 60s and early in the 70s, records that were published when there were 11 or 12 albums that I might have been a little young to purchase," he said.
He agrees that the buyers of discs are more likely to be introverts that enjoy their own company, and adds: “I don’t burn or drink much.
This is my evil."
A 25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of his customers match the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed the people of a new wave that the media’s enthusiasm has influenced. People who have heard that the records have come back to fashion and who have become the need to buy back their old records.
On the basis of my discussions, people have generally been separated from their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their disks back," he says.
This can explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakens of certain ages.
But what about the alleged sense of the discs?
In a trade like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that disc stores offer a comforting community for similar types of people.
According to Wez, some older customers have been injured especially in the near payment system.
Some vinyl fans can shout from the digital world and choose to trust in the persistence of familiar records; objects that resemble the memories of the happy days of teenagers.
“I think that sometimes it may be about filling the hole or some kind of comfort,” says Wez.
As a collector, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your thoughts.
“We’re like their social workers!” another employee said suddenly from the disc.
The April ICM opinion survey revealed that nearly 50% of people who had purchased the vinyl plate last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of buyers of vinyles do not have a record player.
This is where the news report is likely to appear to be a serious concern when I browse the pino of the bossa nova collections.
This "prize" perspective of awakening is something that is also found in the sound of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men) by Jonny, 42.
"Somebody came in a while ago and said, "I don't have a recording player, but I want to buy a radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a big proportion, but this is definitely what happens.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
Not parents, but younger people, my late age, who are just excited about it.
In Fop, which now has almost a full layer for vinyles, I have a much more versatile audience arrived.
Seventy-tenth couples, tourists taking photos, teen boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the movements mentioned earlier - the speakers freshen Wild Beast's freshest sinful and sexy pop, and not improvisation jazz - it is great to see different customers.
None of them look very lonely, but it is difficult to prove the trueness of a psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes, watching various discs on sale.
He's making window purchases, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so recording is not really an option.
"It's expensive.
It is easy to listen to music either on the computer or on something else, but the beauty of vinyl is... he shouts in love.
"I don't know how to explain - it's really unique."
My last stop was said to wake up the new vinyl lovers generation: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time, when I'm trying to look like I'm looking at the jeans, I've discovered a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a while before my father and daughter thought about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left there is a staircase covered by Adelen, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: the mix of modern music and classics, the essential records of any medium collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just decoratives, and some are so high that it's impossible to touch them.
It is purely "arts".
However, given that even a small attention received by these items can mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the Soho feeders to get more, there is no much complaint here.
It is not surprising that the population with more likely time and money is also the one who uses the most luxury, such as vinyles.
But even though my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are correct at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They certainly do not spend Thursday mornings by malking around Berwick Street’s record shops browse records and avoiding a creepy 30-year-old television manager’s watch over the shoulders of unfamiliar middle-aged men.
The Holker is the most live gerinced animal - video report
Scientists say the holker has a longer lifetime than any other planet's spinal cord.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says that the record is on a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years, which is five meters long.
The French Court rejects the application to dismantle trades from Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the application of Calais's authorities to dismantle tens of temporary shops and restaurants from Jungle's camp where thousands of refugees live.
In court proceedings this week, Calais's authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle 72 temporary trades in which people sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea with 50 cents (40 pounds), or sell simple food with a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect’s agency argued that the places should be dismantled because they represent taxes on unpaid co-processing and because they are a risk of fire and cleaning.
Humanitarian groups have told the Court that trades and restaurants are vital to say that free meals offered by the state-supported organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing population of the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often offer protection and free meals for those who need them.
The Court in Lille ordered that there were no legal grounds for extinguishing 72 people running temporary trade, but said that Calais's prefektium's concern was "comprehensible".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafés and restaurants had a much greater role than just feeding people living in extreme uncertain conditions.
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the bulk threat was the camp Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose activity is unprofitable, offering 200 meals daily, English and French hours, as well as asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s coffee shop.
The letter sent to Guardian said that closing the café would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
Two charity organisations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9000 people - to top reading - after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
The price of food in Finland is clearly falling faster than in the EU average.
Food is cheap in Finland for the pleasure of consumers and the problems of producers.
The price of food has fallen by almost 5% in Finland in three years, when its prices fell by 0.9% in the EU countries on average.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
During the last three years, the price of food has fallen to the second largest in Finland from the EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
Compared to the UK only, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information is published in the Ilkka Journalic article, Director of the Statistics Centre’s Development Centre, published in the Information & Trendit blog.
The newspaper compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food increased dramatically.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” says Lehtinen.
Then the turn followed, after which the food has become cheaper for a year.
The bans on imports of food imposed by Russia are now under pressure, which have blocked food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the producer prices of agriculture have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in short terms,” says Lehtinen.
The rising price competition in industry and trade has also affected the price decrease.
The large trade chains S-group and Kesko both have lowered their prices.
The price competition for the consumer has been seen as the most significant advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not an affordable diet, even though the price of food has fallen a lot.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU countries with a similar salary level in Finland.
According to the newsletter, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on VAT.
He found that if the comparative countries had the same VAT rate, they would be sold to third of the cheapest food from the same countries in Finland.
The newspaper compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparative countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finnishs.
"If we want to get to the level of food at the price of the old EU countries, VAT must be pooled to the average level of the EU countries and continue to compete on the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Journalist notes that the calculations made by him at the rate of VAT are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
The returning to the school seat may notice that the change in school has occurred during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
It is a guide to work in all schools in Finland.
Schools decide about the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of a beautiful writing is abandoned, and instead, schools begin to practice coding.
Sweden’s teaching begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and the social guides will begin to be read in four.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
It was thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
In this way, they try to make school visits more interesting.
The longest spine in the world was found - ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) is known for ice creams only at the age of 150.
It can still live for 250 years afterwards, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest spine in the world.
In the animal, only an Islamic womb, the oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Women stretch dogs longer, they can grow up to 5 metres.
Since the growth rate is slow, according to the clubs, only about a centimeter a year, adults have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleague at the University of Copenhagen found out.
He determined all the ice sharks of adults from 28 nails that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed from the radio-carbon drive of eye lenses.
The average age of studied sharks was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 cents of amateurs, appeared about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice creams reach genealogy only in more than four metres, researchers decreased that they were about 150 years old at the time.
The research was published by Science.
Stockmann is fired to nearly 300 - the sellers are not reduced
Nearly 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
The cooperative companies in the company with difficulties ended at the beginning of August.
As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs are reduced, most of which are executed as dismissals, Stockmann says in its communication.
According to it, the number of sellers of goods is not reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, some 80 support activities are offered as a seller.
Stockman’s yt negotiations were about 3,000 employees.
At the beginning, the need for reduction was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims at approximately EUR 20 million annual cost savings, which are to be realised over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve the savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in getting profitable from the store.
While the company’s corrected business result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the trade in goods continues to lose.
Stockmann vs. CEO Lauri Veijalainen said that sales in the commodities have not attracted the company’s objectives.
“People reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive results of Stockmann Retail in 2018,” says Veijalainen.
The second quarter result improvement was based especially on the wardrobe chain of Lindex’s good success.
Ketju achieved its second quarter of all time’s best turnover and results.
The operating profit of the Lindex increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
During the corresponding period last year, the whole Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales will decrease last year.
The corrected business results are expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the most rainy in the north - temperature below 20 degrees in the whole country
The low pressure centre on the north of Finland will keep the weather on a rainy Friday, says the meteorologist Ilona Láng of HS.
In the middle of the country, there are rainfalls, but the southern is the bubble.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country’s mercury remains below 20 degrees.
In the northern rain regions, 10 to 15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team shakes the dopingscandal - a strange explanation for the temperament of the coach
Kenyan general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah appeared as an athlete of the country team in the doping test.
According to AP, an athlete in which Anzrah tried to appear is 800 metres of star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan Earth Team, told me that Anzrah's identity was revealed after she had given a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials appeared to the authorities of Anzrah.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he “make his crimes against Kenya’s country team.”
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use," said Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, to Reuters, the news agency.
The general Olympic sport begins on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run immediately at the time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Last year, Rotich was ranked in the MM races on the way to the fourth, and there are pre-Rio winner favourites.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya’s general sports team claimed that Anzrah went to an athlete accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When the antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was tested.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he was afraid to reveal,” the source told.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s general sports stadium rubberizes its emptyness
Where is everybody?
At least, the Rio Olympic Stadium is not following general sports.
On Friday, Rio began a struggle for general sports medals, but the world’s top individuals were able to introduce their skills to a confusing to an empty viewer.
On Friday, Rion’s organisers said that only 58% of the first day’s morning race tickets and 65% of the evening’s tickets have been sold.
Four years ago, the second was in London, where the stadium was pulled out of the hurricane people.
Final tickets have already been sold in Rio.
The Rio Olympic viewer has already attracted attention before general athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the sights of rugby, noise and riding.
When the Brazilian medal drives in Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach balloon in legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the watch was full of it.
After the two of Brazilians, Holland played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12 000 were still full of people.
At least the bad way to go is explained by the fact that Brazil is far from European and Asian racers in economic difficulties, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazil football team did not get full of football stadium.
Mario Andrada, the informant of the competitors, said at the weekend that 82% of tickets were sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends for sale," Andrada said Reuters.
8.5 million tickets were sold in London, although the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over 1,000 euros.
More than half of the tickets pay less than 16 euros.
In the Olympics of London, volunteer workers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because the organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
However, the organisers in Rio have provided 240,000 tickets to schoolers in the country for less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
Rion's stadium had enough empty places in the morning.
Even the beach ball Copacaban sand has not been interested in the public.
Jukka Central Hall competed in London 2012.
There's enough people on the papers.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in the conservation of nature by new means.
The foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant areas of nature.
After that, private, companies and entities can redeem the rights of holders in the country.
The foundation has acquired its first land from Lapland.
The land area has been virtually divided into blocks that can be acquired by the applicant against payment.
The holder shall receive a veto right in its 187 squares block, which means in practice that no approval is required from each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for more blocks.
Acquiring the right to administration is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or gift.
There is no need to go to carry banderolles or chain themselves somewhere to protect nature,” explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to control his company.
The acquirer of the administrative right receives accurate location information from his block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of the holders’ rights acquirers are compiled on the same map, where the block data of the land are found.
The spread fabric is considered to be the risk of its natural protection acquisition only to change the operation of the foundation from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a general benefit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation will act in some way unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The main idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is the protection of nature areas so that they can be in touch and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land areas either by buying or donating.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has acquired its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside the borders of Finland and plans to purchase land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest on 13-19 August at the Helsinki Chamber of Commerce.
Bicycle thieves tortured by large cities the worst of Turku - see the situation in your homeland
Bicycle thieves torture the largest cities in Finland, the worst of Turku.
This year, more rounds have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
The Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police on the basis of the bicycles reported to be stolen in ten largest cities this year's January-August, and its parts per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were at the top.
According to the police, there were four to five bicycles per thousand people.
In Espoo and Kouvola, only two bicycles were reported per thousand people.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, the population is proportionate to double the number of thefts compared to others," characterizes the police officer Tommi Reen.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The generality of security can be influenced by how much the city moves on wheels and how many wheels are on top of it," thinks Sergeant Temu Äkäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, thinks that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu are looking forward to getting to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycles is largely gone according to which are study and cycling cities.
There is a tight center in the market, short distances and a lot of rounds available for thefts.
"For example, Espoo is a very different kind of city where city centres are distant and bicycle is not necessarily a priority tool for moving," Reen says.
In January-August, there has been a little less bike robbery in all Finland than in the corresponding period of the last year.
There is still no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police will be aware of a little more than 20,000 bicycles each year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 wheels per year.
"They're big," Reen says.
In fact, the thieves take more wheels, because only some of the victims inform the police of theft.
Reen urges people to make a criminal report on bicycle robbery, even though fewer than every 10 cases reported to the police will be resolved.
Typical uncovered bike robbery is one where the police will get information about theft immediately and the thief will be caught in blood.
“The incidents will also be discovered in the context of other investigations when, for example, a drug case in the apartment can find stolen wheels,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, cyclists will be caught each week in the course of their work or police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
He said that wheels are stolen, for example, from bicycles, interiors, stocks and bicycles, i.e. from everywhere where they are usually stored.
The most individual bicycle models are stolen in the past years as Jobos.
The U lock gives the wheel a better protection than many other types of locks.
Some of thefts take the bike, for example, for their short-term use, but most of the stolen wheels end up selling, for example, via the net.
They stay on the domestic market.
“Of course, the police have not found out that the stolen wheels would go abroad,” Reen said.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful because he may be guilty of hiding crime or violation.
"The alarm bells should be ringed if the wheels are sold on their clear bottom," Reen says.
The special library official Severi Hirvi will always carry the colorful Nops for his working day to protect the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five pieces, but none stolen, Hirvi says. "I've never been taken, there's been a good monk."
“Even if this isn’t so attractive to the thieves, there may not be any hipster value here,” the Greek Monster wonders.
In a Kiosk located in the Helsinki Kallio, Transi Valve locked his bicycle in a small U-lucture.
Now the bike hit the kiosk against the wall, but generally Valve locks his bike in a solid, like a bike.
"It comes to think about it a lot, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," the helsinki student says about his white bike, whose body alone cost about 500 euros.
"They all the time hear from friends that the wheels have been taken."
Mostly bad spins, such brutal guys.
A bike was stolen from the inside of the house company a year ago.
However, the wheel had been unlocked, so Valve was expecting it to be trapped.
Under the age of 15 to be responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki experiments with the U.S. peers
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury attempts to prevent young people from entering a criminal round.
At first, the trial is applied to persons under the age of 15 who are now under criminal liability.
The jury lacks a crime committed by the first young.
The idea is that the jury discusses the incident with the offender and imposes sanctions.
A week later, the offender may join the peer panel to reimburse his actions.
For example, other consequences can be a letter written to the family, explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
The youth director, Tommi Laitio, says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used parallelly.
“All of them are guided in a more responsible direction so that everything does not go wrong with the first mistake,” says Laitio.
There is a model from the United States where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, a young person is not going ahead of the adult panel, but reflexing the events with about the same-aged people.
The model has been tested once.
Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio, following the experiment, tells us that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first offences of people under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with before.
“It has been a message that continues on the path you choose,” Lovio says.
The Comparative Election Team is part of the Helsinki Immigrant Youth Project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new ways of action are offered to all those who need, not just immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding the Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding the Donald Trump presidential campaign.
From the letter, the American newspaper Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is directed to the President of the National Committee of the Republicans, Reince Priebus.
Signatures want the party's money to be directed to the Congress Halls instead of Trump's campaign.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his ignorance, incompetence and record discomfort, threaten to bring democrats to the vote,” says Politicon.
Only the direct direction of all possible funds to the Congress Halls can prevent Republicans from drowning a Trump decorative anchor in their neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, because Trump’s chances of winning the presidential elections will decrease every day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent next week.
Among the signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizational persons of the letter is apparently the Republican Andrew Weinstein against Trump.
According to Politicon, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "the people who want the party to protect their majority in the Congress" and that it is not the support of anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump's actions, which are believed to have insulted millions of voters.
He was also said to show dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Previously, 50 officials working with national security this week announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises to facilitate the family of children in the United States
In the United States, Presidential Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton told the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president to make the US economy go well for everyone.
“Donald Trump aims to be president to make the economy go well for him and his friends,” Clinton said.
The Clinton plan has a massive, $275 billion five-year programme to improve the U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by rich tax increases, in part through private money.
The construction program is a hand-resistant for American dunars who suffer from the transfer of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder, we have to go back to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of children’s families working.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to be taxable, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he has previously supported.
"I am opposed to all trade agreements against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before the Clinton speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday, that it “wanted only millionaires like this”.
Trump's suggested reduction in corporate taxes, Clinton has previously appointed "Trumpin's pork holes".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the listeners of small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump has not paid, and the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start making products in America itself," Clinton blew.
Such are Rio's viewers: Kisat has not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interested in
Usually, sports races are seen in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain tips.
To date, the Olympics of Rio have not reached a great number of viewers.
At the same time, the races have glued to the grids at the top of the 12% of the population: Tuesday night’s swimming followed by 615,000 audiences from the Yle Olympic TV2 at the same time.
Due to the comparison: the EMs of a month ago received nearly 800,000 audiences at the end of TV2, and the EMs of football fairly another million.
The most interested in the Olympics so far has been cycling on Sunday evening and opening the fifth race day, both reaching almost half a million viewers at the same time on the Olympic channel.
The top sports manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the viewers, and reminds us that the viewers will first share in the Rio Olympics in several different instruments.
In addition to television, the Finnishs follow the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV watches are going to choose the Olympics.
On the side of the television, viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports races to which Yle owned the entire channel.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London races or in the 2008 Beijing races, but the difference is explained by the difference in time - a large part of Rio's races will be in Finland during the nighttime.
Another reason for dizzy interest - if someone now keeps it dirty - is definitely a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early races, interest would have gone up with it.
In addition, general sports is just beginning, as are other Finnish-interesting species: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkise, the number of viewers were close to the expected.
When general sport begins, the audiences explode.
Yle lanseered a Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for races, which rose on the first days of the races in the Apple App Store for the most downloaded free app in Finland.
By Monday, the application was downloaded 150 000 times.
I guess we're going on the way to 200,000 downloads.
"We only get the blood's viewers later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked with all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been linked with delays and other small technical problems in the early stage.
Applications have received updated versions that should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are more visible in the Yle channels and arena than any other sports event ever before.
From the Yle Fem channel, you can follow some species, and on the radio, Yle Puhe conveys races every day.
Olympians are not only working animals for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed by the Yle channels.
Since 2018, the Olympic Sports will be seen on both top and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Sun, the depth of which is 95.3 metres on the Crossbow.
It might be deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical suburbs trainer, found about 20 square meters of the crossbound printing, with the depth of the diving computer appeared 104 metres.
During the summer 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre tried to inevitably confirm the observations by shining.
The method may not be found in a small depth of 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth remains 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
More than 80 metres are located in Saimaa, Secondary Water and Headquarters.
They have not been studied as accurately as the Sunnetta.
In particular, the bottom of the Lake Inari has not been carefully maped.
“There could be some unknown depths,” Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by the medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 metres.
In view of this, your Sun will not be able to reach the ten deepest crowd, and Suvasvesi is still farther from the top.
Correction 12 August at 14.29: Corrected last song, where the deepest lakes of the middle depth were wrong.
Individual tax: Retirement tax continues to be tighter
Retirement tax is still tighter than wagers.
A person says that an inconsistent occurred under the parliamentary elections, and the tax of pensioners was promised to be equal in relation to the employees.
The government's proposal does not include this.
We think that should definitely be there.
Promises given should be followed after the elections, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wagers received reduced income reductions that reduced tax.
The case was heated by representatives of the opposition in the Parliament, which drove off the electoral promises of the Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (kok.).
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
In the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpon (kok.), tax depreciation is mainly about ensuring and increasing purchasing power, since next year wages will not be increased.
He says that tax cuts have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase the uncertainty of people.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk.) and Orpo’s messages for the desire to respect the competitive agreement reached with difficulty.
He says that maintaining the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by labour market organisations, so it should not be questioned.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much for domestic demand and people’s own future faith.
Long-term Unemployment Disruptive
A person urges the government to address the long-term unemployment in the budget gap, at least to stop its growth.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than a year earlier.
He said that unless the growth stops, the government’s goal of increasing employment to 72% is to run away.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there is a huge social decline in the promise.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
Last night and last night, at least four people were killed in the bombing attacks in Thailand.
The Embassy calls on Finnish citizens to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the guidance of the authorities.
There is no reason to cancel the trip to Thailand for explosions, but the Embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
In Thailand very little Finns
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to evaluate.
The Finnish Thai travel period is scheduled for the year-to-year shift.
Most Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from the Finns in Thailand via Facebook after bombing.
The Embassy has tried to aim, in particular, to find out about the situation of the city in Hua Hin.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, there is no evidence of the attack.
The Ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political restoration of the shared Thai society and the last week's referendum of the constitution prepared by the Military Jun.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open democratic process.
People were arrested in the country, among other things, who announced to oppose the law.
In the southern provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict in Muslim populations, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their right of self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Bangkok is today a great, local holiday, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the birthday of the Queen and the Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very small.
The attacks affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very accurate for safety.
Thai Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from ordinary terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also closed, according to AP, the Thai police report.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the popular Phuket and Hua Hin of tourists.
Even in the popular tourist destination of Finnishs, the holiday island Phuketilla exploded four bombs at night, says Bangkok Post.
According to the current data, they did not require death sacrifices.
The two bombs exploded at Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
In Hua Hin, the popular tourist destination, according to local authorities, has exploded four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one of the two bombs died.
In South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in both towns of Surat Than and Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many travelers, as it is carried by Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
Factor of attacks not known
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military train in Thailand, said that the attacks were not yet known.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We do not have to panic people more, he said to journalists.
According to Vice-President Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the factors had been intended to destroy the country’s tourism, because all the attacks have occurred in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland calls on Finnish citizens to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns planning to cancel their journey due to explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the big horror, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
The attacks and their victims during the night of Finland are very little known for the time being.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has been time to get a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At Hua Hin's last attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded in the sights of a well-known clock tower.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin, where it believes they have found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower seat, according to the governor of the county.
In the attack, the municipal employee died.
There are at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN tells us that the Surat Than attack also used two bombs exploding around half an hour.
Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The United States Party won the Fourth Game of Women
The United States Alexandra Raisman was the second at 60.0998 and the Russian Alija Mustafina was the third at 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for a bargain championship in Rio's races with a permano, jump and boom.
Biles has controlled women's gymnastics in mind for the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships since the last three years.
He has won the Fourth Championships and Championships three times consecutively, both in the last and second year.
In the United States team, Biles has achieved two World Championships.
Biles has a slot and a boom.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism, running a play club of children in the same property in Phuket.
If there are no more attacks, then I don’t think this will be any more amazing, it will be estimated as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
Experienced entrepreneurs have seen close to many of Thai tragedies.
There's always something here.
At first there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb in Bangkok.
If these former tourists have not been expelled, this is hardly even.
The Huovila company office is located a few hundred meters away from the explosion site.
Huovila heard of the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about nine local times and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were placed because of the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many had not even heard of attacks on the beach.
Half three times a day in Thailand in Patong, the traffic had been normalized and most of the stores had opened their doors.
According to the explosion site, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila at the attack site.
Later, this car was seen at the Kruunupyy in Jouxholminte.
When the police arrived, the car was fired.
The patrol spotted two men who were suitable for the sense marks, hiding in the close six.
Another man was immediately captured.
The other escaped, but later the man was found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage of the motor vehicle.
The police thank the people who gave the tips.
Research Director of Russia's Leadership Changes: Clear Displacement
On Friday, the most valuable change in leadership was made in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin dismissed his head, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is a 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He was an ex-graduate and acted as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from collecting too much power around him.
He added that the recycling of leadership tasks is one way of power.
This is the way to prevent people from gathering independent power for themselves.
According to the fabric, it is also possible that Ivanov has been struggling with other executives or screwed up.
Ivanoville
Ivanov, who belongs to Putin's interior, moves to specific environmental and transport tasks.
Putin said it was a common decision on the tape presented by the state media.
Putin said Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed persecution to be replaced, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from the Ivanov point of view it is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia in order of importance.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin in KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old map, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
The older researcher from Katri Pynnisniemi, the Foreign Policy Institute, says that it is more interesting than the successor of Ivanov’s place is that Putin switches his neighborhood to the younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as human shields when they retired in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to Jarabulus to avoid targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, who is a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to the Iss.
However, it is estimated that tens of jihadists remained in the city.
Earlier at 19:30 a.m., we failed to tell civilians that civilians were fleeing from the city, actually the Isis fighters kidnapped the civilians when they escaped from the city.
Professor: The Publicity Line of the Ministry of the Interior is illegal
The policy of the Ministry of Interior of Public Documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutian tells STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the authority's own lines, but it is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to release the list of participants in the events of the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The minister justified the decision by the guidance of the State Council’s Office and the fact that the information was entered in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The minister’s communications director tells the STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
The Last Olympic Show in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt has been running against time under the value races.
He insulted his backwards from the early season and had to skip the Jamaica Olympics.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am much better.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
The press conference included small-shaped sambatants and fans.
Porina Bolt around is underlined that the Jamaican star has risen during the time when general athlete has been competing with the dopingscandals and a splendid interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat in the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he retarded 200 metres in the beginning of time 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down your injuries and loose training position.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred metres in which he crushed the world record and the final celebration of the competitors’ self-confidence.
This is harder.
A year later, at the Berlin MM competition, Bolt reached his career at the judiciary point, measuring the clock.
The world records born in Berlin at 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 twentieths are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is seeking 200 metres of world records and 19 seconds of subcontraction, but no one believes that it was born but Bolt himself.
In the 100th century, Bolt’s very challenger is Justin Gatlin, the 100th Olympic winner of Athens 2004.
Last year, in the Beijing MM final, Bolt defeated the American in only one hundred seconds.
Bolt has not lost in the final of the precious races in Beijing once, if he has just reached a journey.
In 2011, the MM final of the 100 was left out of Bolt due to a devastation.
Bolt fills in a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the young men's species, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the next year's MM competitions in London as the last goal of the career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm downstairs, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrated interview.

I'm just trying to have a little fun, and BBC's Olympic Olympic Commander Helen Skelton laughs at the evening's instant interview.
Helen Skelton (oik.) is the most reader of this week on the website of the evening magazine.
Next to the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not much stressed if some or British press has a small spot of his revealing and special outfits.
Television is visual media, he stresses.
Skelton has dressed in high-rate shoes and short dress with at least enough exploration - at least in the eyes of many conservative British views.
But the back steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and the small ones are just a funny thing.
Skelton is sure he wants to shake and maybe he's intimidating, but he stresses that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're watching sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the womb has risen to Finland?
I can't, but all that focuses on how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they make, is OK for me, Skelton sniffs.
You know what?
It's an empty thing if it comes from a (contractor) dressing.
I'm a little fun if this one's hit someone's radar.

Argentine's Lady Pucked the Fakeer-Siren - Finnish thought about protest
Wind Pester-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Fake-Siren cooked hard on Thursday.
Argentine’s lady hanged the Wind in Rio on Thursday at the opening of the day of women’s surfing.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted a breach.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away, said the head coach of Finland, Joakim Wilenius.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing it because it would have been in vain according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen in the water so I could have received a refund, and I was told by Pestler-Siren.
The Finnish man hanged on his board until the last time, because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
With the accident, the Finn stayed in the 27th place.
In total, London’s 2012 Olympic Olympics are eighth.
There was little impact on the crash.
Friday is an important day when we have a race to leave 10-12.

7 special things that, according to science, extend age
Science has studied everything possible between Earth and Heaven.
These things have been proven to bring extra years to a person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life lasts.
Sometimes things that a person cannot affect himself can bring him more years.
These include, inter alia, a tendency to middle body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping may extend the age.
Always don't even have to break, just to get the milk can.
The secret of a long age has been tried to find out for many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinks have been found to be protected from some cancer, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
Harvard University’s research found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "small death risk", especially with neurologic or cardiac diseases.
Again, on behalf of the alcohol, research that reasonable use - one to three days - may extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental wire use may extend the life of a person for more than six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents ancient infections.
They can also contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in other human bodies.
The study in Norway found out how laughing influenced human life.
For seven years, more than 54,000 people were watching the project.
Those who laughed more were more grievous than 35% more likely to be alive after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when the protection of sex diseases has been taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex in the same way is not enough.
To give a person more years of life, he must also get an orgasm.
Movement, of course, will bring more years, and it will not be denied.
However, a long-term age does not require absolute solacticity.
One study at the University of Oxford found that women with a large backside had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
It was then an athlete or Oscar winner who had become an Olympic athletes, he is more likely to live longer than a normal giant.
Many researchers have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring his life more years.
Some researchers doubt that the long-term age is due to the social status of a person - which, for example, contributes to the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
The study on the shopping behaviour of over 65 years of age found that a person who shops on a daily basis, i.e. less likely to make purchases older.
This is due to the fact that cycling in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may early death.
So count your credit card on your hand - the online hobby has no same effect.

The post sent stamps to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in the range of Salon K-Citymarket’s bullcake because the mail had accidentally delivered some of the load to the Seinäjoki.
On Thursday, Teija Halti, who lived in the potato, was buying bubbles from the Salon K-Citymarket when a fun sign was hit in the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are lack of products in the bulk because Posti delivered our load to the wall river!
We'll get more when the Post gets the load delivered!
If you don't rush in the lawn cut, you read in the sign.
The trader’s sign relates to the fact that Posti expanded his services last spring to the lawn cut.
The cooking is available in Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly fun and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with a disgust.
The media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention raised by this matter is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia had more than 700 divisions on Facebook.
Halt was caught in a bubble bag, even though a few camps were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of the company transport services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages distracted yesterday to the wrong place (Seinajoki) and we no longer left for the part-time service (Saloon) on three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
This is the first news of the East Words.
Teija Halt was not upset by the sign because he found all his own bullcake favourites in the selection.

Wishing of the family of a woman who was murdered in a sense: the memories of the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by donation for police work.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it will provide the sacrifice of donations for police dogs for the family's wish.
The publication states that the victim had worked at the Sipoon Veterinary Station as a substitute and also carried out his nurse’s training there.
The veterinarian's station reminds me of the words touched by the woman.
Joyful, smart, sense of humor and work is fearless.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donation funds will go in full to police dogs, primarily to purchase security flags.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisan woman was murdered in his own homeyard in the Koskenkkylä of Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbors have said the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flower.
A suspected 27-year-old man did not know a woman or had any contact with each other.
The murderer was tracked by a police dog Börje, who was injured in a life-threatening situation.
Börje survived and is recovering.
The law of the person who was in charge of the breach of the Act of Equality was sentenced to Post.
The post had no right to detain the salary of a refusaled employee who had refused to know the tenant of the tenant in Kanta-Häme in his judgment.
Post ordered the employee to pay most of his salary and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only part of the employee’s salary, which corresponded to the share of the study throughout the day’s work.
According to the law of the guardian, the employee was placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the Union for Postal and Logistics on the PAU organisational decision on the prohibition of learning.
During the last year’s postal strike, PAU decided that postal workers do not experience persons who violate the strike.
The People's News first told me about it.

Putin separated the head of his administration to replace a viro-speaking persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed president Sergei Ivanov, Kreml.
The Soviet Communist Director Karl Vaino's son Anton Vaino will be replaced.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as vice-president of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired his government chief.
According to the Kremli Communication, Ivanov, which belongs to Putin’s close interior, will move to specific environmental and transport tasks.
Putin said Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed persecution to be replaced, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in spying KGB.
Many viewed Ivanov as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin’s re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's Ticket Procurement for Game Ban - can't be seen at the Open of Valioliiga
The World Recorder of Football Transfers will not be seen on the field when the English Valioliiga is kicked on the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban was followed by England.
Due to the ban on the game, Paul Pogba, Manchester United is on the page opening his league against Bournemouth on Sunday, said BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million for the Italian Society Juventus from Pogba.
However, the UK Football Association FA keeps him away from the game, as Pogba has left Juventa to be a challenge for the game ban.
He received two warnings in the last season in Italian cups, and it becomes a single game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, FA told BBC.
Pogban's next seam is playing in the second round of the league, 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is good.
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established the position of the Flow Festival as an internationally respected event that the world’s top artists are staring.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
Festarchs have typically expressed themselves with their own dress.
One of the artists of the head is this year punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stylished, among other things, by artificial law and art installations.
We have never had enough to just beer and beer, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival held this weekend in the Helsinki Suvilahde has grown from a small block festival to a event of tens of thousands of visitors.
In the background of success, there is a simple question: what kind of event would the factors themselves want to go?
In the event of an injunction, it is quite unusual to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the authorities’ regulations, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell this year to the end.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors last year by 5 000 people.
Festars will also see a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because it needs to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point, the mass would be like a flock of livestock that is guided in huge roads.
That's what we don't want.
Ideology has been expanded over 13 years so that there are 130 presences in the area that have been partially arranged with artificial lawn, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars.
In addition to the main ferry and smaller stages, this year the tent of 15,000 people operates.
Kallio admits that the event could be done more easily.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If it disappears, this is no longer our thing.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done to Kallio is that today there are many visions that are practically possible.
During the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the operation was very dependent on the aid of approximately EUR 20 000 in the city of Helsinki.
Last year, the turnover of the Flow company was approximately EUR 6 million.
It allows you to create "great things" like building that 73 metres wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event is not consciously profiled as specially fashionable.
We want to be separated, above all, with content.
However, the fashion phenomena also match the value world of Flow: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists of the head is the legend of the punki, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer of indierock, pop music, rape and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was busted because it is probably the last time we see it in Finland.
All of us are interested in history and future.
Not just what the commercial radio plays.
Iggy's last record is damn good, and he's done damn good work in the past few years.
The bombs of the Thai tourist paradise were hidden in the flowers - tourists fled in their horrors
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded local time on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were hidden in a flower bag and exploded with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were exploded at the same time as tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, according to the police representative Samoer Yoosumra CNN.
Since 1989, Asian wildlife protector Edwin Wiek had a lot of impression on the attacks.
If the TV doesn't look good, you can look at it here.
There were at least 11 foreign tourists in Hua Hin.
The people ran against me and said the bomb was exploding at the bars.
It was one of the biggest bar streets, told the Swedish secretary Emelie Olsson Aftonblade.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon after that, the Finnishs also loved Phuket’s island, exploding two bombs.
No one is known to be dead.
At the same time, there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang.
The police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin, who had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombing attacks that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, there may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been engaging in the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new preparedness forces will go to war first.
In the acute war situation, warlords are ordered to fight duties only after several months of the admission of military light, says Central Finnish.
According to the Head of Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnis, for example, 5.5 months of armed officers in the war situation are only those who are in battle at the end of their education.
According to the Head of Education, the reserves belonging to the emergency force are first assigned to the service.
None of the guardians or reservers are ordered for a task that has not been given the required training, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, the Defense Forces began to train armed personnel in immediate capacity units from next year.
Units can be used in military operations during the training of the war.
Pamela Tola received giant compensation from the home house
Actor Pamela Tola and his ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a hard dispute on the apartment they bought in Espo in 2009.
The price of the two-layer separate house was EUR 330 000.
However, after trading, there was a serious moisture problem in the house that caused a dangerous microbial growth to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment as a decay in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198,000.
The couple brought the case to court and demanded a discount from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in the court and court.
The court ordered the judgment on Wednesday.
It held in force the judgment of the Court of Justice, ordering the seller to pay to Tola and Waroma for a discount of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the costs of the couple’s proceedings and investigations of EUR 47 344.
The right to a reasonable reduction of price slightly, as some of the need for repair of the apartment had already been known by the buyers when making a housing trade.
However, according to court law, the reported errors were considerably more serious than had been reported.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told me in court that the couple had specifically searched for a decent home because they did not want to take up repairs.
He was born with the idea that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the points mentioned in the fitness check report are not harmful.
The fitness audit report referred to as risks and inadequate ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting waters floating along the rockworks.
However, the discussions did not show that it would have been an urgent issue.
Tola and Waroma believed that rainwater from the rock might have to be controlled a bit within a few years.
The trades were made in October 2009.
In a few years, it appeared that the humidity problems of the apartment were much more serious than thought.
In the 2012 and 2013 inspections, the building found microbial growth, according to witnesses, due to both the rainwaters of the rock and the capillary rise.
On the west side of the house, the air polluted by microbes could also be accessed through the villa.
The possible health risk, the limit values above the bucket or ski were found in the wing samples in the housekeeping room, the basement staircase, the living room window evaporator, and the basement washing room.
The terraces were built without permission
The court also contested whether the apartment was extended against the construction permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the city of Espoo before the trade was made that the apartment had been subjected to anti-licensing changes.
For example, the terraces were built, even though there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in the court.
According to court law, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living in the same way and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
According to the Court of Justice, there was no particular reason to carry out a wider inspection.
Buyers have not neglected their obligation to report, the court states in their judgment.
Fearful archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - in the register also Finns
The journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent Dagens Nyheter article about the records recorded in the American National Archives in Maryland, about 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi Morsiame.
Documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-Germany Race Agency.
The Race Agency was under the responsibility of Heinrich Himmler, CEO of SS.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was studied by a SS doctor.
The same was the case with even more women who had to be able to give up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were conducted gynecological studies to investigate the matter.
The Race Agency investigated women’s backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in women’s family.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Race Agency handwritten life stories and good recommendations to the closest.
The Race Agency wanted guarantees that women were "children", "safeguards", and "good national socialists" who knew very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme, among other things, stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, the U.S. Holocaust Museum websites are reported.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The German mother’s tribute was granted to women who had received at least four children.
The marriages between the Nazi-Germany and the "non-arhians" were legally prohibited, the museum’s pages were stated.
The Sixth of the Faller-Sire, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was the third sailing in the first day of the Finnjols, leaving the Rio Olympics, but the whole group left the tail of the second day.
In the whole situation, the nigger rose eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second exit dropped him instead of 14.
Wind Pester-Siren fought in the RS:X class of days leaving places 17 and three.
In the overall situation, the deceased-Siren is the sixth.
In 470 classes, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren stayed in the opening of the day at 23.
The Lindgrens are in the 19th position.
Jari Sillanpää Satulinna recorded a couple of hours in the night: "I was so in a canvas"
Jari Sillanpää has been part of Finnish favorite arts for more than 20 years.
The Bar Mickey of the Crushing Ship for the Tangonian of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the stars of dance ferries and festivals, the Sillan Head continues to be able to porsk, and he is currently in a ruthless lift.
The book written by Mari Koppisen, a favorite singer’s life, Jari Sillanpää, was published on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and evil.
The career of the bridge grew into a total rise in his winning of the Tangonian Crown in the Tango River in 1995.
In the race, the Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece on the bridge at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finland’s music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: the bridge head sang it on the tape in a terrible crab and only after a few hours of nights.
We had a party tonight.
I was so in the canvas!
The bridge head remembers in the book.
A huge hit from the capture of the song would not instantly imagine it was sang in the crab.
Although I wasn't physically at my best, the trace was still good.
I learned that it is not necessary to demand the perfect and excellence of myself all the time.
Another incident related to the most popular songs of a man, which was reported in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, the Sillanpää separated from his partner and the case ended in the texts of the gold piece that was published in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered from the Saara Collect were not the same as the Sillanpää would have wanted.
The bridge head had imagined that he was making a record that tells the truth about his own life, but the words of the song of the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 days.
In the news of the newspaper, the reason for the difference between Jar and the ex-loved was that of Jar’s excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jar said it was a full bunny and not true.
According to the book, Jari called the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of the voters had a difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the vote week’s opinion measurements anticipated the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
None of the highly respected research institutions or universities have flagged the difference, even though a couple of individual researchers had to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The main mantra of Western politics, former President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid", flew down in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic guitar language
The Centre for Macroeconomics has the latest monthly survey from the professional community to answer the Brexit disaster.
The answer of the type is that the economists were not listened because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economists' explanations for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of workflows, thus almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the right British.
Many also have the idea that the depreciation of the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
According to the Economy, voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, BBC’s equitability, which gave just a few percent of the economists representing the EU’s difference to economic scientists as a superfluous majority.
The EU-inspired press was not interested in telling the opinion of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic specimens on the consequences of the difference.
These remote letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, state debt and currency.
And if the economists were both listened and understood, they were not communicated because the economists represent an elite with which voters do not think they have common interests.
Academics such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message in small cities and rural areas did not work.
Immigration is also a economy.
The overwhelming argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will congest your hospital, the immigrant will use you.
These arguments worked out.
Every café has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In each health centre, we see immigrants in the waiting room.
How much easier would the British get medical times if they weren't?
Every school has immigrants’ children as well.
How much easier would the real British children get a school place if they were released?
Every municipality lives foreigners.
How much more space would the early people have if they left?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, apartments and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they succeeded, their responses did not receive visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, less health centre lines and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and, in particular, EU immigrants - are British net public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Reserved in Brexit Cash
One of the funds was the Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are responsible for the Finnish Pertti Old.
According to her, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the winning of the EU-department camp, was started to be more prepared for a few weeks before the vote in case the result was left.
The problem was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
The Real Estate Funds do not normally have large liquidity funds, but now they could be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23th day, we had 25% of the investment in cash or liquid funds, the old man says Aberdeen’s only open daily notebook of the real estate fund covered by the news.
According to the old, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The value of the fund was 3.5 billion at that time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, the old man says of all the Open Real Estate Funds of the United Kingdom.
He estimates that the lowest cash in these funds remained 10% or even below it.
Thus, the building funds reserved very different strategies for Brexit.
Funds closed trade
When the EU-promoting camp won, Europe went insane.
However, few of the two weeks following the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, said the Old Man.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney’s speech by the Director-General of the Central Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
They kidnapped the situation together and brought it to the headlines of Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Old Man.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball began to rotate, and the fund afterwards had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it is worth pulling the money out of the panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of them canceled the notification.
After that, it was quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, the old man says.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen European Funds have not had any similar deterioration.
But there were a lot of surveys.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
The old man believes that the closures of trade in real estate funds received undue attention.
The open funds covered by the closures govern approximately 4% of the UK property.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds on half of 2017.
Currently, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been ripped down, but the situation does not seem to be "stronger" for Aberdeen.
The main questions are now about the future development of the UK economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought some new opportunities for real estate investors, the Old Man points out.
The exchange rate for pounds and dollars is the weakest in 30 years, and there is a 15% reduction in the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property at a discount of up to 30%.
There are lots of buyers, old man says.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market
Two nights in the morning, the situation didn’t look so bad yet.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for Aberdeen Asset Management’s real estate investment, re-waken to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The word of power was in it.
I realized that this is going to the plan B now, the Old Man says in his second home in Helsinki.
He went to work right away.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning night.
The news was supported by the TV boxes normally silent in the office, and usually the loud people quietly listened completely when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell his divorce.
When the market opened, the screen ends flashed just red.
It was a morning that I would never have believed he would live, the old man says.
It is therefore not because, despite the abolition, Aberdee, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, finalised two real estate trades on the day following the Brexit vote.
The feeling was confusing.
However, the company was well-prepared for the option, and therefore the situation was kind of calm, says the Old Man.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leader changed.
The market began to predict severe bills for the UK and in particular for the London real estate market.
There were up to 20% of mines in London’s office premises in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade after each other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm is down, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not show its last summer holidays on the face of the Old Man in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is too early to say much about what comes from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first informed.
CBRE’s information on price development covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all London buildings fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, minus accumulated 6.1 per cent, the old man listed.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, says the old man.
All equally high drops hit the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was relatively quickly compared with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis from the US real estate market.
The old man believes that the parable is not quite a match, as it is now a domestic crisis in the UK.
The emotion is also another.
The real estate market has now not seen such a panic sales as that time, but the willingness to sell better liquidity, said Old Man.
There is also a financial guarantee normally.
The repair movement could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, the price repair is not a miracle for him - that could have been before without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of property in London and other world-wide cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and, in particular, the offices are overpriced, the old man says.
So the fall started very high.
London's prices have risen up for four reasons, the Old List.
The UK economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estates are the last ownership class that is globalized, Old Man says.
Middle East and Asia have become new players, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment destinations abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by a low level of interest, for example, for pension companies have had to seek income from new items.
The loan has been readily available on this – although, according to the Old People, the debt has now been clearly used in less than during the period preceding the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the price increase slowed down last summer, the old man said.
Even Aberdeen began to reduce its ownership in London, and last year he was a net salesman.
There was some kind of translation, and now it came.
What's going on?
It depends on how the UK economy develops, the old man says.
A lot he dares to assess the future, but he says that there is hardly any rising moment.
The emotion suggests that there is a dropling or a steady shift in front of us.
The old man has already seen more movements up and down since he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the coupe will be survived with work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much of the victim.
If it has been decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, the Old Man says.
S Group starts registering purchase information in more detail than before
The S Group will know what you eat, as the trade group told us today that more detailed information will be collected about buying their stock customers.
Up to now, when information has been collected on the final amount of the receipt, the group will start with it also from the purchased products at the beginning of May.
The S group is here after Kesko, as the data of the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a few years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO Ismo Riitalan, the feedback from the program has been mostly positive.
The product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing authorisation.
The most effective channel is email.
Quite few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to the Economy statements.
He said Kesko will not respond to the changes in the registration of the S group.
Kesko already categorizes its customer in ten groups according to the only food shops.
The classification is updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount used for them.
The information is used for targeted marketing for the customer.
Product-specific purchasing information is collected only from the K-group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a base client program and does not have that in this case.
The Finnish Neighbourhood Store has its own single-bonus client program, which can be associated with the Choicehouses, Siws and Euromarkets.
We are currently not collecting product or product group information, we remain at the end of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made and what day, and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level like the K group or the S group, says Anu Ora.
According to him, the stock-friendly programme will continue to be reformed, but the Middle Trade will tell you later.
However, Ora does not promise that the product information should be registered.
Initially Experiment
The SOK customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive until now.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information includes professionals, training, housing form, and the births of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase date and time, place, total purchases and payment method has been recorded from the S-Price card purchase.
In addition, S-bonus partners information has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase information at the product level begins to be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In the S-markets, Prisms, Home Terros and ABC chains, the information is still recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been wishing that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partners of the SOK.
The S Group says they will inform their customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the information is stored in the bags anyway, wanted it or not.
You can check your data on the S-group website.
For example, the cash is not available, stresses Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is the latest dog confirmation of the Tulli - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador driver's puppet sweeps intensively five boxes in the same country at the Helsinki-Vanta airport.
It won't take long when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with its favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a bottle of carton gas was found.
The rust gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and access to online trade
Heila is the first dog specialized in the search for weapons and explosives and is placed to work at the Helsinki Airport next year.
Working tasks may take Heila and Suntion to other border crossings and ports as well.
However, the airport will be the main job in Heila because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris-Brussels attacks caused measures in Tulli, and after the attacks, the surveillance has been confirmed, says Mikko Grönberg, inspector of Tulli.
Another access to training of weapons and explosives is postal broadcasts through Helsinki-Vanta.
With an increased internet trade, the airport will pass up to 40 million postal transmissions each year, including foreignly ordered weapons and explosives.
In recent years, the Customs has made online shops in Helsinki-Vanta airport, about 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their source.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered baggage and mailing.
In ports it will have a great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more accurate research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether weapons and explosives will be trained more in the future.
Grönberg is looking forward to the idea.
School in Churchnumme
The training of the Heila penis is coordinated by the School of Dogs in the Church.
Suntio also attends the police and defence force experts with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs decide together with other authorities what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Hela will always be further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport have six drug dogs in Tulli, as well as money and drug dog Massi.
Labradorindator Heila has been selected from ten puppy puppies.
The choice criteria for the dog to be selected at the airport include a cavity and a hunting ticket, as well as calmness, as the dog is in contact with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Without Heila, there's no way to get anything at home, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders will go to Heila from a single box.
The cameraman of the evening-words loses a camera for a quick dog, but Heila restores a soft toy-looking protection immediately from the "irti" command.
Hard competition for work dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, which will assess whether training is sufficient for demanding work tasks.
Heilan can be seen at work in the next half of the year, if everything goes according to the plans.
Travelers can’t unfortunately come to silence the working vests on the dog, reminding Suntio.
The cost of one work dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owners.
Working days can be long, between eight and ten hours, but active working shares can only last from 10 minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the dogs is a hard competition in Tulli.
Helala was the owner of around 20-30 Tulli employees.
Happiness hit the Suntion site that had never had a dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Tulli.
The Ministate received its first Olympic Medals - the people get a free day

Even in Chinese restaurants they watched the game, I heard them encourage, said the journalist of Fiji Times to Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish singer fainted after the brutal performance
Milko Tokola succeeded in his last company from 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature.
During the criminal lifts, or immediately after them, he has passed out several times.
No one really knew why.
Tokola scored 175 pounds and 145 pounds in Rio.
His joint result was 320 pounds.
Tokola was trying to get his job at the last time 175 pounds, as did the other one.
In the third company, the weights rose as a shout.
The body was trembling under weight until the judge accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish advocate was the fact that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired a virolai choker Prosan - Betting League - Ilta-Sanoma
The Rovaniemen Palloseura in the football league of men has concluded a lasting agreement with Albert Prosa.
We are looking for the top player in our team with power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
With more than ten players agents, we went through a lot of 50 players from all over the world.
A small number of people began to be separated as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen, said in the newsletter.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from the winter Flora where he made a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian country team.
Prosan should be involved in RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki where the Rovaniemeans meet the dominant Finnish master SJK.
RoPS had a need for a new attacker when the last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Dangerous Modern Family Star meets again: the Teen Shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who was familiar with Alex Dunphyna as a gentle family comedy series, re-entered by presenting his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don’t leave a lot of imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also the back of this.
Winter, 18 years old, has recently attracted attention by making his style and behavior more brave.
The star has posed in pictures published in social media in very few clothes and took a number of tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen to wear very small clothes.
Winter has recently published several photos of his own celebration.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
In this case, the founder of PowerwomenTV and CEO Amy Palmer suspected Winter has a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on TV almost all his life and has grown during the era of Kardashians.
He has learned that the more exposes the surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen in countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series only 11 years old.
The actor has been depressed by some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where he is in ten years, when the bottom is already so hard, a woman in Winter’s Instagram says.
Instead, some of the women's fans defend the actress and asks not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what others say.
You are an inspiration for many women, inspiring a young woman.
Japanese want Nordics preferably to Finland - tourists are attracted with a revonul: in the autumn, it is possible to see a saturated mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japaneses to start revontulimatkas from the beginning of the autumn, Visit Finland says in the newsletter.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Japanese reunion tourism.
Revon fires are the articulated cards of our winter travel, and they are strongly combined with the heart winter and snowy landscapes.
In the winter of Lapland, there is very demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the revonussonk begins from the early autumn and continues far into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the revontules of the vision of the two layers of saturated, says Visit Finland v. marketing manager Anne Lind.
Visit Finland’s main target group is wealthy 25-35 years old, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to the survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers at Turku and Tokyo University, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive land image among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and this revont has a huge potential according to Lind.
Overnight stays for Japanese tourists have increased significantly more than other Nordic countries in Finland.
Last year, they stayed in Finland more than double than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finland’s tourism as a target group, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese used EUR 183 per day in Finland, Lind says.
The UK takes a rugby hopean Master course organized by Fid, leading to gold
The impressive progress of the United Kingdom in the rugby tournament collapsed into the final challenge of Fidz in the Thursday night of the final, when the team experienced 43-7 crushing catastrophe at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi arranged a master course in the process, bites, avenues, support game, running lines and silk when winning gold - their first Olympic medals.
The defeat was accompanied by a reasonable comfort from the silver mills - the third day of the UK - and they were proud of their hard work at the start of the Olympic rugby tour, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Previously on the same day, the hard 7-5 wins of the semifinal from South Africa could bother them in the final.
Despite this, Fidi would have won a top 15 team in this condition.
The United Kingdom may be - but probably not - comforted by the fact that at least one British has a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fid's main coach is Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon.
The UK journey has been quite a bit.
Eight years ago, as Ryan trained, they lost every game at the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This spinal sauna hurts, but development is fascinating.
Fidi started greatly to fight the British fights for pleasure.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they ran towards moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner of the goal zone.
When there were four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuwai's other touchdown in the right corner led to a goalpot.
12-0, and the UK had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's great bucket stopped Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it was just a slow step for Fid.
In seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made the goal at the right angle, and the United Kingdom was losing 17-0.
Nakarawa made a goal for a new start, and there was still more than a minute left... the first half time.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou crashed through the United Kingdom's found fights and jumped to the line to make a goal.
After the recession, the situation was 29-0.
It seemed like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the UK was just learning the game.
And that's exactly what it is.
During the break, the United Kingdom made a lot of changes that blocked Fid's dam... for four minutes, which was well compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova made a goal after Fid's impressive feed game.
Dan Norton captured the United Kingdom when he made a goal in the left corner of touchdown and narrowed the situation into 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea islands whose supporters sang, shaving tickets and dancing in view.
It was hard not to admire the pleasant approach of Fid.
Mata Viliame in the last minute was a choke in Fid's cake that didn't need a choke.
The pilled, the fidians hugged, and the United Kingdom fell on the lawn, completely beaten.
Previously on the same day, Fidi had hit the Japanese semifinal in 20-5, and the United Kingdom won the South African tight semifinal, where both made one goal - the British goal race solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the painting area with devastating footwork and painted the paint under the paintings in the second half.
A great late fight from Marcus Watson, the 15-story rugby team from Anthony's brother, secured victory and eventually a silver medal.
The fight against cancer, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning,
In these races, there will be no more creepy gold than emotions, and it really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard strolls towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were playing alone, there were three votes on the boat, coach Robin Williams' echo was present all the time when the twins consecutively consecutive Olympics in women's couple competition - the first women in British sport history books that flourish into such achievements.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th performance unbeatable, which is also a record.
This is what we see, two great athletes joining the surface with a sleeve with a lock, not a full picture of the nature of victory.
In the background of each bowl, there is a group of helpful handpars that gradually contribute to things that matter. And no pair of hand was as essential as a coach who did not know if he would live until today after 30 months of cancer diagnosis.
As he said, the situation was a mess.
I had urinary cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut it, it spreads everywhere.
The situation could have been quite bad.
It's changing your thinking a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The three were lucky that his treatment could be started at the beginning of 2014 outside the period, where they caused as little disruption as possible - if it could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It motivated me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Songing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Shortly after the win, the first couple thoughts were Williams, who had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little more commonly trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, a captain experienced in the group of royal tyres in Afghanistan, said, "I've been an emotion this week, which may be a bit overreacting, but this means so much to me."
It just emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin, have been working.
For three years, Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have anything, so he gets great thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better trainer or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition in five years.
A couple set a hard rhythm on which their competitors did not drive.
In the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very closed in a moment.
Helen shouted "spy in the process, stay in the process."
It is very important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We were not looking for fireworks today, we were just trying to win a good war and a race, and so did we.
A couple will wait a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he marrys a TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say that this would be my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better," he said.
Iceland replaces the Panama leaks government
In October, Iceland will organise premature parliamentary elections, which are already required by demonstrators who have been raged by Panama's data leaks in spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that several Islamic politicians have circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson divorced because of the scandal, but it was not enough for protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold new parliamentary elections in autumn.
The Election Day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last-last rage of the nation affects the autumn election outcome.
In June the presidential elections, the criticism of the empires was clearly shown, and Gudni Johannesson was elected president from the outside of politics.
Trump said he was sarcasm when he claimed to be the founder of Obamaa Isis
Donald Trump, presidential candidate of the US Republicans, revoked his last speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that President Barack Obama would be the founder of a terrorist organization in Isis and a democratic candidate in Hillary Clintonk.
The Democrat Party became angry with speeches and demanded a apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone in charge of the army who can fall down around, Clinton's tweet.
In South France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the Muslims' favorite covert burkini swimming pools, for example, of the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is prohibited to go to beaches and swimming for all who do not have a good way and have a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also says that bathing suits, which express greatly religious links, can increase the risk of order disorders in France, which has been subject to terrorist attacks.
In mid July, 85 people died and hundreds of people were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a population celebrated the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremists connected to the fathers attacked the church in North France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the waters in the Oulu region passed through the screen - By the Parking Lake, the blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blue-blu
Water samples taken from official swimming pools in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only in the beach of the Parking Lake has been detected with blue-blue stamps.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu region’s environmental action took water samples from nine EU coasts and 30 other general swimming pools in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the coast of Merinieme, the concentrations of all bathing waters in E.coli and intestinal gasococcal bacteria were lowered by the provisions of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and gasococcal water in the sea coast were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacteria were lower than the limit of action.
The blue sauce observed on the beach of the parking lake does not yet make water unswitting, but in favourable circumstances, the situation may rapidly change as a blue-blue flower, making the surface of the water form blue-green resting ferries.
The environmental action will follow the situation with more frequent inspections.

MTK Hakkarainen for forest donation: More than 80% of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest gifts is one of the tax changes in the next year's draft budget of the Ministry of Finance.
Income tax laws are proposed a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the exchange of forest generations.
In the presentation of the Ministry of Finance, forest donation has four objectives: promote generation exchanges of forest farms, youngen the age structure of forest owners, increase the size of forest farms and increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the pure capital income of the forest economy.
Overall, the idea of making such a tool that promotes the generation of forest farms is good, commenting on the Director of the Central Association of Agriculture and Forestry Producers (MTK), Juha Hakkarainen.
However, Hadrainen finds criticism about tax change.
Forest gift reductions are presented as a task for the clean capital gains of the forest owner.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
The MTK and Hakkarainen believe that the tax reduction would be more effective if the reduction could be made directly from the sales income of the tree.
The presentation of the VM will lead to a reduction in the pure capital income of the forest economy by preventing the loss of the capital income of the forest economy, which should be reduced in other taxation.
Such a person would receive tax benefits even if the tree were not sold.
The calculation model is infinitely complex.
The average forest owner is unable to describe it, Haharainen says.
In addition, he believes that only a small part of the forest owners is concerned.
The limit for tax reductions linked to the return value of forests is EUR 40 000 in the presentation.
It's too high in Hakkaraise's opinion.
In such a way, he believes that 82% of Finnish forest owners are removed from the deduction circle.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the goal of growing.
Forest policy has been taken by Hadrainen for decades.
It is based on the age of the forest owner.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and around half of forest owners are pensioners.
The strong bruise surprised the car drivers in Himanga - two cars swinged into the dive and crashed into each other
There was a special retreat on the Fish River Himanga on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Service, two consecutively driven cars were sliding in their streams, after which they came behind, they crashed after the driver.
According to the day-to-day firemaster, Harri Pyydet is suspected of a strong rainbow.
In the back of the car there were two people transported to the hospital.
There is no more information about their injuries.
The driver who drived above did not get hurt.
The accident occurred on the 8th highway from Himanga to Kalajoki a few kilometres.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
The findings made by Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that cancer’s hardness increases cancer’s malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow in a normal way in such a environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented in laboratory conditions by returning the cancer surrounding tissue to the normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissues in the treatment of cancer cells.
Research results have been published on 4 August in Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
In the court, the prosecutor requires a murder sentence to another person.
The tree of the family home death continues in the court for both convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for family home death in Muho.
One received 8 years of murder and gross robbery, including a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years imprisonment of murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted was also sentenced to the risk of traffic safety as a young person and the transport of the vehicle as a young person.
The prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who received a more severe sentence were appealed to the court.
The prosecutor demands a lesser punishment to condemn the murder committed as a young person for 12 years of imprisonment.
At the time of doing, they were fully understood.
According to the law, 17-year-old young people killed a school home as a head of child protection unit, working for a man in July last year.
According to the justification of the judgment, the 17-year-old, the murderer attacked the director on the couch of the living room.
The director had been able to get rid of the shot and tolerate the young person in his room, and the other young people hit him with a sleeve.
The director was also strangled, hit and kicked in the head.
According to the mental study, both convicted were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from family home at least since the last day.
The ice shark is the longest spine in the world, grows only at the age of 156
The world’s longest living spinal cord has secured ice shark, says the research published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark swim around Greenland, i.e. the holker can live up to 400 years old.
The female is only growing at the age of 156.
The life of the ice shark increases the fact that it only grows in a centimeter year.
Only one species of chimps are known to live for longer ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age of radiocarbon drive.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, researchers were able to evaluate the age of sharks.
For the oldest age, 392 years were estimated, although the throw in the direction or another could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump’s Financial Wisdom - People’s News
Donald Trump America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the state's tax revenues would be lost if Donald Trump's changes to corporate tax were made.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular with the most wealthy tax incentives.
Trump described it as a revolutionary presentation in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax would decrease from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount of $1,000 billion a year without collecting.
The excess income tax rate is now 39,6, after the reduction made by Trump 33.
Heritage tax would be completely surrendered.
Trump accused the state of excessive trade regulation and of bankruptcy of small businesses.
Emergency-definitioned environmental standards must be reintroduced and energy regulation should be dismantled.
The Barack Obama Health Reform needs to be addressed again.
The administration must be appointed "executives instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, the “destructive” trade policy is the biggest cause of the US problems.
Free trade agreements would be canceled.
For imports from China, 45% and Mexico would be subject to a 35% penalty tax.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our credibility, Trump declared.
Donald Trump America does not need to change the world:
American cars are going to drive on the streets, American aircraft to combine cities, American ships to supervise the sea, American steel to lift new clouds all over the country.
Unlike his will, Trump read faithfully the speech written by assistants, even though well organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those near Republicans, see Trump's program to drive the United States to deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released his own program on Friday.
Attack of the past - News of the People
The sea is devastating, but the actual attack wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street hallway - an account with the past can begin.
The story of the Pedro Almodóvar.
Almodovar's previous control work Travel lovers (2013) was a little fun and ronskin-side satiir comedy, the pre-skin where I live (2011) the tops of the Spanish career.
Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between these two works.
It is an intimate love, human relationship and family drama in the middle of a relationship between a mother and a daughter.
The story is a simple game and we see it as a long backpack.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) can be wondered until the end meters of the movie.
In the form of a back and long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, the time between Ommelta (2013-2014) from the TV series.
Juliet's age has been treated in a way that can be regarded as a stone, but I would say that it's a bit stubbornly and literally in a single swim.
For Almodóvar movies, there is always a fair distance in Julieta.
It is a flatly played, controlled, place in places with good music, and quite sadly a movie that has such elements to the gesture.
Instead, the characteristic visual colorfulness of the Spanish director is stored and in a way that it begins to put a little quietly in the eye more purely shaped than a functioning dramatic means of efficiency.
The people of the film are suffering from diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains one Korean.
This is especially true of the costume: in the case of a person of name, residents vary from a scene to another, and the same applies to visible ears.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing is that the inspirations of the scene are not particularly improved.
Mechanically repeatedly, the impression is external and a little spiritless.
Almodóvar has written a script on the basis of three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro in Nobel 2013.
The novels have been published in the paper: reports.
Almodóvar has contributed to dialogue, resulting in a bit of written literature filming.
Ingredients would have been emotionally versatile to drama even more drama, so much of the big things - especially the cliffy guilt - deal with the thematics of the movie.
Direction and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Alice Munron is based on three novels.
Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - the People's News
No new cuts are made, ministers shouting so that the Finnishs do not fall completely.
However, the spring cuts are carried out by a grinding store.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk.) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.) are convincing the budget dispute.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM's presentation because social security cuts were already decided in the spring frame.
Children's supplements, national pensions, basic unemployment and almost all other benefits linked to the population pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of the unemployment security in the victims will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Educational surgery continues.
Continental Haunts
Why do the ministers stress that there are no new cuts on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities will be held in April, and they are the main heat meter of the electoral period, not the gallops.
It has already been seen that the government’s result in the different directions of the government’s political parties will be ruining the government’s atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallup states that the Government Party's basic Finns is expecting a loss, although the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finnishs received 752 new mandates, most of which will be realised in the first spring of the right government.
The life line of three or more large parties is due to the fact that the country of the Finnishs will be sustained.
Now it has not endured, but more than half of the voters in the first year have had enough government policy.
The first signs of the party’s group’s visit have also come to the surface.
The new cuts will not come with rhetoric, first of all, the fact that next year they will be carried out rashly and secondly try to soften the expectant attack of the Finnishs.
Big Surgeons in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different - if the Sipilan government is still standing.
The government has set a target for the loss of debt during this electoral period, but the Petteri Orpo budget proposal will take EUR 5.9 billion next year, or more than this year.
After the municipalities, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government cannot follow its own programme: debt is not tailored or even slowed down.
Another thing is to stick to the program.
This means new, even more severe cuts on former people in the 2017 budget gap.
The budget would be at least close to balance in 2018, and then in spring, the parliamentary elections will be taken against what will happen.
These actions do not match debt
It is absolutely clear that the current activities do not match debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to lie down a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Martti Hetemäe in the awareness-raising of the budget demonstrate it uncontradictably:
World economy growth forecasts have repeatedly proven to be overoptimist, i.e. not a petty aid from the international economy.
Finland’s economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has been extended from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
In the course of the rounds presented by the Seven, the debt of governments, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will rise to 70% in the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt promotion presented by the Left Association was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about EUR 6 billion, which is virtually fully covered by a new debt.
This is the idea of the Centre, the Assembly, and the fundamental Finns about what is responsible.
Question: The Government wants to leave a lot of tasks
Three of the four believes that the organisation of day care for children, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, it is evident from the study of the KKS - the Foundation for Development of the Kunnallis sector.
A clear majority of the people will also take responsibility for the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civil education, construction supervision, high school education and waste management.
The province’s responsibilities are more clearly desired for county plan, special care, vocational training, vocational higher education, and instituted care for developing disabilities.
None of the responsibilities of the municipalities is intended to be transferred to the state.
The underage driver ran to the police to run for a ride.
Joensuu’s 16-year-old motorcycler drove a police patrol in Joensuu in Ilomantsinti on Friday night at half a time.
The police department tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man left to drive the police to escape fairly high speed.
The rear drive continued on the Sonkajaranta road, from which it continued on the Sorronahontie and on the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle went out of the road.
After that, the young man left running away, but the faster-footed police ran into the escaper.
The blowing test for the driver showed 0.75 proms.
He also had no driving licence that would have justified driving a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, inter alia, as a serious risk of traffic safety.
The truck in the stones fell down.
The truck in the stones fell down on the knee lake on the Kavintie on Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.

The ingredients of the major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The tents of the Parafest festivals have smashed the drainage flow caused measurable damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafestation, estimates that the festival is economically accessible to its feet, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Parafest Kalle Salonen appeared at the end of Friday night on the market.
On Saturday, the program will continue at the city theatre's premises at the beginning of 13:00.
The Art Center in Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition from 13 to 15.
The programme is scheduled.
The eruption flow occurs in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight starts the decreasing air flow.
Changes in the water state of the Ukkos cloud bind the heat, and therefore the falling air mass cools and it accelerates towards the ground.
It is said from the Air Science Institute that the flows of falls occur in Finland during several summers.
It is difficult to predict the route of congestion flows.
In the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, the Parafest event was hit on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents collapsed, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the event of an accident, four people were mildly offended.
There was one child who was transported mildly injured to further treatment.
Air Pollutants Age Loss in London
According to the study, the skin of the lontoians ages faster than usual.
The reason for ageing skin is air pollution.
The British research says Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retirement-aged London is two and a half years older than the age companion living in the countryside.
Small particles that absorption the skin are very great dust pollution, which is from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, are killed by nearly 9 500 Londons every year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to pass the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk, especially for lontoans walking in close proximity to the congested streets.
People in London can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended to clean the skin regularly.
Tractor brakes betrayed... pushing a man standing in front of him.

via Josban, Kataija and River Boys to the U.S. National Team
Anne Jumppanen has played almost all the Salibandy MMs since 2003.
The sixth race in Tampere is now taking place, only 2013 after Canada was better in North America.
I worked in Turku and played with women in the area when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy country team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such species played at the SM level as salibandy.
It was played at the University.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in the Riverboys ice hockey in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played a Salibandy SM series with the University in 1991-92, the following three went through Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the A-girls to the championship.
Women's SM serial career was exalted in silver in 1995.

Beach volley skilled Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM Gold is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is ending as a beach volley player, at least after a period of temporary duration.
Beach volley Finnish Championships will be resolved on the weekend at Kouvolan Sports Park.
During three days, the medals are played in both adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvolan Airball Players and the Finnish Airball Association, the SM final tournament will be validated for the six best pairs of each series of rankings.
The local color in the tournament represents Elimäen NMKY’s raised Essi Hasu, which has been part of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of the familiar audience.
I hope as many as possible will be able to go to court this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great stage for the pesistation.
I have not played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals in the home corners, Hasu feels.
The area of Kouvola ignited Hasu’s spark for sport and gave good food for a great hobby.
There are very memories of childhood.
I started the balloon at the age of 9 in the E-girls of Elimäe NMKY.
The top of the mind is too big toys, knee shields rotating in the nipples, as well as high ace lips and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small place, the sports club was a strong community where everyone knew each other.
The group’s common spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved, the father of the teammate trained us, and our mother was long-term chairman of the club.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already in junior time a natural choice for the inner balloon to counterweight.
In the 1990s, we have played songs.
The activities have always been active in the visitors.
I also went to follow the SM tour of the juniors, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays the weekend together with a brilliant Anniina Parkkis in the SM finals.
Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahde after the tournament the second ranked twin goal is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
The SM Gold is missing from the prize cabinet, the Funny throws it mysteriously.
The weekend in Kouvola may be the last known audience in front of Hasulle.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are expected in civil work.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toes are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli boldly went to a farmer
As an entrepreneurship, agriculture means risk promotions, sweat and charity.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer, because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Almost two years ago, Koli started working with his little brother Valtteri Kol as a continuation of their home space.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises brothers with their own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt and increasing so that bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy at the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a stove, and at first, the bank had not been enthusiastic.
However, I went very bravely into the project, and I have been involved in it, Solomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had not believed in producing pure Finnish food and that everything would still turn out good.
The goal of Salomo Kol’s breeding meat cars is to invest even more in its larger sleeves.
The work has resulted, as Solomon Koli has been selected for the ten best groups of the future of the countryside in the young food producer of the newspaper.
At best, he competes with a potential win.
He will be able to vote on the website of the magazine until 21.8.
Bulgaria first announces inflation to eight months

The annual average inflation measured by the Life Cost Index was -0.8% (August 2015 - July 2016) over the last 12 months when compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the living cost index was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate was -0.2%, and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.

The prices remained at the same level with the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is evaluated as an Asian Cartoon Type
According to Snapchat, anime has worked as a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to edit reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into an anonymous, dog or character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The lenses are simple, twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfie a day.
All misunderstandings quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized by the accusation that the application advertises blackface or black face masks or prefers whitened skin color as a beauty.
So when Snapchat announced this week to some users a lens that gave them bad eyes, bad teeth and tight cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "Celtic" or yellowface.
And they wondered if these repeated polemiques could be a sign of the greater problem of the company with regard to diversity.
News and misfortune spread widely on Wednesday with the reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day later, Snapchat said he ceased to feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant to be honored to anime characters, not to be a caricature of Asians.
But for racism observers, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
The others banned the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely distributed from photographs, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added, "It's difficult to argue against a comparison with the most brutal Asian caricature and filter efficiency."
It shows that the filter is not only yellow, but yellow, exported to extreme degradation.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be stuck in the endless struggle of diversity and inclusion, corporate meetings to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially diverse young people can mean that they are even more likely to expect a comprehensive attitude.
Katie Zhu, 25 years old, said in the interview on Thursday that when one of the Snapchat lenses creates an insulting image of the user, "they are much more difficult to be noticing."
On Thursday, Zhu, a Medium-based product manager and engineer, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and the phone interview, he said he believed that the disputes related to race reflect the lack of diversity of Snapchat hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company mainly for white male leadership and decided its writing with hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#PoistaSnapchat)
“Whether they have no diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, so they are able to make such decisions,” Zhu said, “or they have different skin colors representatives at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly.”
Other observers share their opinions, a complaint which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish numbers of the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the rotation of his staff, but according to the representative, the company hired the recruiter to focus on the under-represented populations and to advance internal inclusion efforts.
In its part, Zhu said to keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: “Is it so that they really need more users like us to say that this isn’t OK?”
According to the Congress Panel, military officials distorted Isis intelligence
In the report published on Thursday, the Congress Panel said that the US Armed Forces’ Headquarters' Inquiry Reports had been edited to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against Ishies than the events were justified on the ground.
In the interim report of the Working Group established by the Republican President of the Defence Committee, the intelligence committee and the Defence Assistance Sub-Committee, the report founded "the broad discomfort" among the intelligence analysts at the headquarters, which said that their assessment of the efforts of Americans to overcome Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is a military department in Florida Tampa, which supervises US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of intelligence accepted by the higher-valued Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts than the facts on the site justified. They were more regularly positive than the analyses produced by other factors in the intelligence community," the report's press release said.
"Centcom's events are impossible to accept - in the war of our fighters suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-value decision-makers," said Ken Calvert, California Republican.
The failures of Centcom's leadership will rise to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems in the descriptions and analyses of the headquarters of the United States' efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the senior administrations of the Obama regime had ordered reports to be thinned, it describes it as the heads of the Centcom have put pressure on them in the positive light of the threat caused by the Islamic State.
"All the first half of the year 2015, many press releases, statements and certificates of the headquarters for the Congress were much more positive than events themselves," the report said.
For example, the Centcom Authority publicly stated that the major attack to regain Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still owned by Isis.
After months of study, this is very clear,” said Ms. Mike Pompeo, the Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces Armed Forces Headquarters manipulated the intelligence outputs of the headquarters in order to minimize Isis' threat in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after consulting that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence about the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will follow the broader results during the investigation.
The Department of Defence has initiated an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the Democratic Committee of the Representatives' Room published their own findings that were consistent with some of the final conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an uninsulated process for the intelligence assessment of Isis and Iraq's security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's leading democrat.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence products", deteriorated the mood among analysts and "that gave enough space to different perspectives".
Schiff and Democrats said they did not find evidence that the White House had tried to pressure the Centcom analysts to match their findings on "pre-set or political statement".
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the Congress investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that Pentagon’s superinspector has initiated an investigation after Centcom’s analyst complaints.
Commander Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said in the statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the report of the Congress as long as the investigation of the supervisor is underway.
But he said that “the experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcomes a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security.”
The study has other follow-ups than just the question of whether the bombing operations led by the United States are successful in Iraq and Syria (such as the growing number of defence authorities now argued).
Last year's charges questioned how much President Obama can rely on the headquarters to carry out fair assessments of the military activities of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The review of Islamic State Inquiry reflects more than a decade of warranty, when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article that said that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about what sanctions would be at the 2003 attack.
Hooker was also a key role in rebelling about Islamic State intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, the Hoker Group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, air attacks against the refiners controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refiners to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this finding was not reported outside the headquarters.
The Centcom commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the fourth time in women's countryhockey, arrangeing an interim study with the United Kingdom
The day after having made three goals of the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made the United States Women's Earthhockey team on Thursday two first goals for Americans winning India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sound unforgettable, but 27-year-old Bam said he was not sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
“I’m not really a man who keeps a record of his paintings.”
But he knows this: Americans are at the 4-0 event at the Olympic tournament, and they share their group in the first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Thursday in Japan 2-0.
The United States and Britain will meet in the last game on Saturday.
Both teams have survived in the quarter range, and this game determines who is first and who is the second of their six teams in their group.
The first is to avoid a strong Dutch leader, the second group, a little longer in the beginning of the quarterfinals.
Whatever the end of the Saturday game, the Americans have aroused their surprising success here, four years after they stayed in the London Olympics last of 12 teams.
Bam was in that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvanian Blue Bell and picked up the groundhockeymail for the first time at the age of 3 (the older twin sisters played a species in Drexel) as part of the country team at the age of 16, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to participate in his final player list.
In 2012, nothing went on to him and his teammates.
Next year, the English Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same work in London as we have now.
We've done a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam began the first half of the painting with a cluster of paintings near the paint.
India had come into the game with no win at the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and kept the situation in the 1-0 chapters until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball a long time to the left of the field, then rolled in the middle and pulled the ball to the end, bringing the Americans to 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth round.
This zero game was the first U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had released one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
It's also Bam.
“We have a good situation now,” Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
The Peace of Trampoline in the Middle Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, the Olympics are running.
Rio de Janeiro’s events seem to be constant and inevitable, rageous competition and effort as a message.
It's like the Olympic Shopping itself is a flame communications channel that is transmitted from a swimmer to a swimmer and a powerful triathlonist.
It is impossible to put on TV, read a newspaper or listen to a guest conversation in the café line without hearing about the hate of Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time of the Olympics and the future heartbreaker with a smile, could well be one of the names of all known to be presented in the best time of view and supported by sponsorship agreements and good mind TV advertisements - if he was a swimmer, powerful or even a sword.
But Dooley, 28 from California Lake Forest, competes with the Olympic Gold in Trampoline.
The Olympic Light does not illuminate all species as much.
As far away from the center, partly in the shadow, are the species that not everyone generally accepts: air pistol fire, spring fire, feather balloon, taekwondo.
We always have breast-swimming, for how long it lives.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favourites, I would like to pay attention to the reduced charming power of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic race since 2000, when it made its first visit to Sydney’s races, its presence in the past 16 years has been so little to note that many of whom I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic species.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the species, it has never won the medal, and its athlete has not progressed to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, China Dong Dong and Canada Rosie McLennan are defending their gold medals of London.
However, Trampoline is associated with a certain kind of charming of the alleged, partly because of the uncivilized replacement it sounds better for the clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I must admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just an airless fan.
The species have opportunities to entertain, such as the color of the endless bombs of drawing philosophers, but it also has the seal of gymnastics and swiming, the two species that in principle combine.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a pushboard.
The championship aimers jump to the height of nearly 30 feet with giant trampolines, and they need to perform crooking business series (reverses, skills, and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes compete in 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Medal hopers must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the end, sometimes to reverse the field.
They are not only hunting a target line or a beginner, but also, in television news, another unpleasant limit: the world or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatic - and it can even get the viewer into tears.
But this is also the reason why watching the races can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline offers a rest here.
The trampoline is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new rise, acting as a weightless astronaut, goes up, then down, then again up.
Of course, this does not interfere with competition and difficulty, but during the program there is no rageous attack towards the end, no jumps to distance, only the dreamful, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to the zen space as it can be achieved in the Olympics.
Women's cartoon competitions and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon when the shipment begins at 13 (ET), men's races will also come on Saturday at 13 pm.
NBC sends finals as part of its afternoon software from 14:00 on both days.
In the middle of the Olympic noise, they offer a quiet, charming moment which most likely does not notice in the general chaos.
And if consciousness is achieved only by offering men's athletes to be stared and objected (such as American men's forces have recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for a new fan.
"The generation shows its mind" in Ethiopia, a long-term U.S. ally
Violence demonstrations in Ethiopia
Political change has been faced by protesters in Ethiopia.
The eyewitnesses say that tens of protesters have been shot to death in conflicts with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable states, a strong ally in the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country in a growing number of areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people attacked the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to the Human Rights Group, the government’s response was unpleasant.
The eyewitnesses said the police shot and killed tens of unarmed protesters.
Spreaded videos recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be at the end of the last year or from the beginning of this year, show how security authorities beat the young people with a stick while they were forced to stand on their hands against the wall.
The main human rights authority of the United Nations now calls for a comprehensive study.
“It was always difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the African Sarven International Crisis Group, said.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, and western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much help from the Western countries.
The economy of Ethiopia has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Abeba is even a new train for working travelers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have constantly spoken about the oppression of the government, the opponent of the country has been limited, and the dissenters have been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far to the desert.
But this can be changing.
“If you suppress people, and they have no choice but to point out, this will happen,” Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
The whole youth shows its mind.
One generation shows his mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything in the power of the dominant coalition of land use.
After the many criticised elections last year, the ruler party and allied parties received the last place of opposition, and now it holds all the place of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border against Eritrea are increasing. The battle along this tight and controversial border requires hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogade National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated over the past years, can try to use the destructive and rearm.
Many factors explain why bitter emotions under the surface of the years are now exploding.
The first seems to be seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years, a large number of ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become generalised and the internet service has improved.
Even though the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still send a message through the network intermediaries that hide the location.
Many young Ethiopians said this was how they met for protests.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, oromes and amphrases, are better suited.
Oromos and amphrases are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharaes, who come from Ethiopia, mainly from Christian tops, succeeded in politics and business using orphans, many of which are Muslims and who live in the landscape.
But this is changing too.
"We're on our way to organizing under one umbrella," said Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The main protests have been in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many amharas and oromos think that Ethiopia is unfairly controlled by the Tigre people. The population covers about six percent of the population and controls armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the restoration is the loss of Meles Zenawin.
Meles, former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of secret disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw him around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly competent to observe early signs of unsatisfactory and to use secret ambassadors in making opponents harmless.
“Now there is no basic instinct like it,” said a conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was gathered relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, from the northern Ethiopia tigre region, Hailemariam is from the south.
The analysts say that the safety services controlled by the tigres do not trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia was in the power of such a devastation in 2005, when thousands of people expressed their opinion about the elections that, according to analytics, seemed to have first been hutilated by the government and then robbed them.
In the following forced shock, many protesters died, although less than in recent months, and that period of restlessness passed relatively quickly.
Developing experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for visual infrastructure planning, such as the new road train, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly, this has not stopped the indifference of the Etiopian government.
And now it starts to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the city of Gondar attacked the companies owned by Tigres, and the hate against Tigre becomes increasingly common in social media.
The analysts say that protests put the United States and other Western allies in a clue.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights in the neighbouring country in Somalia, even though it once said it had closed this base.
Although western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their unstable allies in the region to fall.
"This," Abdi said, "it's real balance."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-based-Isisi's claim as "sachamm"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his latest campaign, and I argued on Friday that he wasn’t serious this week when he had several times insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the terrorists of the Islamic state.
The study raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have been struggling to defend him during the storm period, into a difficult position in which they must explain the observations that he does not necessarily mean.
On Wednesday, following the suggestion made at the campaign meeting, Trump argued the same intensively in the Thursday interviews, where he insisted that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton created Isis.
In the early Friday morning, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a full translation of the last day when Trump said that in several interviews he was really serious about the accusation.
When the conservative radio broadcaster Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump draw his comments by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this in his hearing ears.
The latest review storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign in the middle of opinion research findings that fall into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned again that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he felt boring.
Trump has used a sarcasm fight before.
Later in July after he encountered a broad review, suggesting that Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his comments by saying "I'm sarcastic."
The approach enables Trump to go to the limits of political speech and then return, if necessary.
“I think it’s a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then ‘select’ in the direction or in the other depending on the reaction,’ said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is keen about his statements and knows that they are indefinite enough to filter them through a number of different lenses.
Instead of alleviating their speeches for a large audience of votes, Trump has been more clever in recent days when his popularity has continued to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Trump hits Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump generally aims to avoid apology on provoking matters, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding their words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
When he faces a closer look at the presidential campaign in the last few months, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies to an uncomfortable position in which they must publicly support him, regardless of how provoking his observations are.
New York’s former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, worked hard to defend the candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
“I believe that there are real, political comments in his words,” Giuliani said when he was asked about the reality of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton established the Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obamaa Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, totally wrong, and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most of the Republicans in the mainstream try to argue that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as a foreign minister, allowed Isis to worsen because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Pennsylvania’s Friday meetings, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media that flourish her every word and are impartial against her.
He mocked the “wrong, pathetic” TV experts who try to get clear of him, saying, “They don’t succeed!”
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse as a new evidence that he was inappropriate as president.
Previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a wireless, only cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but who offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the Bedford Avenue Street was too expensive for it.
The movement that replaced Verb in summer 2014, Soap Cherie sells soap cake-shaped soaps.
The locals stunned it as the latest loss in the middle-class city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is broken and Verb is now a soap store.”
But if New York is a change, it is also a reinvention.
The revived Verb opened to Greenpoint last November, less than a mile away from its original location.
The new Verb has a wifi and can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same unpleasant atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verbi is led by Cisco Rodriguez, the long-term employee of the old café, who is the owner and director of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same kind of espresso.
It even used the old Verb lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
On the menu you can find pecan egg cheese sandwiches, for example, caprica and onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
There are no beer in the café anymore, but fresh juices are made there.
During nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed the currents of the old stock customers.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers," he said.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these customers.
Oliveira, 34 years ago, lived in Williamsburg and visited Verb on a regular basis.
After he moved to Greenpoint, he went to the cafe.
He said that when Verb closed, he gave up the coffee drink for a while.
“I understood that I enjoyed Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a chai drink mixed instead of his ordinary ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
The second long-term customer, Tom Rosanthal, was faithful to Verb since 2003.
He used to work there and always made the same order.
“Every day, fifteen more than seven, regular than the clock, I went in and they were preparing spices with my bagel butter,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosanthal is still making a regular order, but sometimes because of its variation, he has a room with spice bagel pekon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't wear a grudge to the soap store that took over the old spaces.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to prepare Verb for a special sauce in which to use as an ingredients for cold-extracted coffee in the cafe.
“I think we can still catch the offer,” Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it out soon to make his new neighbour feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice site wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the café extends to the next building.
Many customers are enough to get their old favourites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a customer and said it was unsafe when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he was coming home when he walked in and ordered a coffee.
"I've wanted to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Depressive Food
In March 1933, soon after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat from lunch to his office.
President Roosevelt liked the finest Fifth Avenue dishes, such as the goat's liver caterpillar, and Maryland's bowl turtle cooker.
On that day, his diet was more modest: filled eggs in the tomato sauce, potatoes and desserts from the plum pussy.
“It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” Jane Ziegelman said.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added, “It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat.”
A couple in Brooklyn Heights is food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told me about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about life on the Lower East Siden floorhouse through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their newest collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American food during the 1930s of the great depression.
By demonstrating their own culinary solidarity, they will meet the journalist at dinner in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unpleasant lunch bar in the Flatiron region, which has been operating since the 1929 stock market.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered fresh cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose of turkey, potatoes and vegetables.
When the journalist ordered meat mushrooms, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss the eating of the season.
"The problems were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut mushroom, liver fractured, papauretta.
They were made from a manufacturing substance and some of the cheap ingredients that continued the actual manufacturing material.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would form your dinner.
Coe was irritating.
"It must have felt like a lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the dawn, the American tables, especially in the countryside, were like eating a lot like a jaksat-out table.
Women’s groups made food for male farm workers, and a fresh pie was served with breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during the first World War. The A Square Meal book crowned the ways the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a country of enrichment.
“The food became a central, afflicting topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One agitating was a new, affordable diet: Mystery foods, such as muds and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was a “great way to use food stars”, mentioned Ziegelma, because the cooks could hide less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which had been in the middle of American meals for years, became a sustainablely administered luxury product.
Special compositions were tested when calories and nutrient content were more important than taste or even healthy reasoning in the kitchen.
During the study of a book containing recipes, Ziegelman also prepared an age of food in which fried bulbs were filled with peanut beans.
“It wasn’t popular for dinner,” Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
The peanut butter is not suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Home Economy experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the federal household agency in 1923-1943, led the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
In the newspapers and magazines, public recipes and articles would encourage women to become "budjetsmen" and respond to the challenge of converting so-called spagetts and carrots such as carrots into tasteful doses.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic flavors.
Particularly delicious are the reports of the government's response to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, let me eat your cake gun.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his child’s simple, iowan country food, he ate as a fined millionaire who had become him.
"He liked continental food, like a fish with a cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate almost a golden dining room on his head.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake unless his wife, Eleanor, encouraged him to be an example of his own stomach.
As it says in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a nurse who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that “not only offered the most delicate food of Washington, but also the worst-made food.”
Many of the dishes were rejected as soon as the land returned to its feet.
The tradition is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of the eating methods of Ziegelman’s mother, such as how he could not throw food away.
“He really was afraid to waste food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "He even injured people."
There was a wind-blown intermediate incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe brought out the dessert that they had prepared at home: a plum food that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum malfunction," Ziegelman added that the general trick was to give the modest recipes a name.
There was no cream foam, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and rabbit.
They all embedded their spoons in a brunette.
Suddenly, it wasn't bad.
Coe sank once and another.
As he sounded like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little bit of scratched German peanuts could help."
The costs of advocacy for Gilead in the fight against a hepatitis C patent against Merck
The U.S. bride judge has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the costs incurred by the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc in a disputed case with the hepatitis C patient.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million payments after they violated two Merck patents related to Gilead’s success medications of Sovald and Harvon. This release followed when the American judge found misuses of Merck, including false oaths and other unethical practices.
In the Thursday judgment of the United States bride judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to release the compensations caused by it when opposing the action.
Merck tries to catch Gilead, who manages the market in the new hepatitis C drug generation, which can clearly improve more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
In 2013, the case was brought by Gilead and Merck when they challenged each other’s right to the active substance of Gilead’s medicines on the basis of the laboratory work under the sofosbuvir.
The U.S. troops say that they have completely conquered the Manbij, controlled by Isis.
The troops supported by the United States have fully conquered the city of Manbij north of Turkey after the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, the group's representative said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city left it.
The troops had released more than 2000 wing-leather prisoners who were considered prisoners, the Sharfan Darwish SDF federal force, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
“The city is fully under our control, but we have started to study it,” he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax declaration, which showed that the income of the democratic presidential candidate and his spouse in that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mainly to Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned almost 5.3 million dollars of speaker compensation, and the former foreign minister announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster’s book where he told his career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, published 10 years tax statements.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a standard for economic transparency," Clinton's campaign supporter Jennifer Palmieri said in the opinion.
As a vicious contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and revokes his earlier promises of publishing his tax statements.
In general, the US presidential candidates will publish their tax declaration, even though the law does not obligate it.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the audit of the tax administration as a reason for refusing the disclosure of tax declarations.
“Your turn,” said Clinton’s campaign supporter Ian Sams on Twitter when publishing a link to the Democratic Science’s tax statements.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them before the audits are ready.
Trump critics, including Presidential candidate Mitt Romney of the Republicans of 2012 and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his donation to charity, his business and many other links to Russia, for example.
Clinton has grabbed the problem on Friday with a web video that highlighted visible Republicans that urge Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has made in the past decades: he published his tax notice," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the 1990s, and the New York Times business colonist borrowed on Friday numerous tax agents and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named according to Warren Buffett, a billionaire investor that would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30 percent taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton meeting in Nebraska Omaha last week, Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax statements.
Buffett said that he is also in the process of auditing the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax collection agency, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax statements until 2007.
The actual tax rate of Clintons living in Chappaqua in New York was around 32% between 2007 and 2014 and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax statement showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most of the Americans.
Their main investment target was a cheap, indexed investment fund, and Clinton announced $100,000 dividends and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and shrinks enhance the protection of the elephant in Tanzania
Natural Protectors in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from travelling to people's residential areas - they throw animals with chili powder filled condoms.
The art has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation invented many years ago, in conjunction with the American Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of North Denmark to use the non-violent four steps to protect homes and hundreds without being injured by animals.
In the past, many used storms to protect themselves.
Friday is the world’s elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since we developed... tools, we have seen a change in attitude in these communities, and they are now much more confident about keeping elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said Damian Bell, CEO of Honeygues.
The first two steps include the intrusion of an elephant with a flashlight and the call of a storm.
If it doesn't stop the animal, they'll throw the so-called "chilipilvi".
The condom is filled with the mix of chili powder and the ground, and then the condom is twisted so that only the lighting wire remains visible.
When the condom is lighted, it breaks up and blows chili powder dust into the air.
One scent is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
The last way is the trigger that shoots a Roman candle in the air. The fire will produce a sound, clear explosion.
RT News: The Jewish filmmaker criticizes the Berlin hotel that erased the Israeli direction number at the request of Arabs
The French Jewish filmmaker released the media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's direction number. According to the employee, this is due to the "applications" of the Arab customers.
The Shoah documentary about Holocaust made Claude Lanzmann’s jar of frustration to Berlin’s Kempinski Bristol hotel, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find a list of countries offered by the Israel hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been erased and wiped?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own phone center.
When looking for an explanation, the filmmaker took this up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer from it was "stripped him".
The recipe from the hotel said it was a "determined decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the decision caused even more shock in the filmmaker.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel’s direction number,” said the employee, according to Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "great misunderstanding", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
“We were terrified and shocked because of the case.
It is already a great misunderstanding.
But even more shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a response online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski hotel was simply "adopted" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Free", said in the second publication, which pointed out that the hotel on the beautiful Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagoga.
The hotel itself denied all the charges quickly and called it "incomprehensibility" and "forgive" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
“It is a clear command not to include Israel in the Quick Selection List,” Kempinski’s representative said Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
The police used tears and rubber pieces against Brazilian students
Students joined the police on Thursday in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, when students gathered to express their views against government reforms of the public education system.
The police used tears gas and rubber stores against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement attempted to disperse the student force, which led to the use of rubber and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students participated in their demonstration to express their horror about their plans.
According to Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, Governor of Sao Paolo, some less than 100 public schools would be closed, and 300 000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against the walls of the interim President Michel Temer.
This last demonstration took place only days after demonstrators left on the move as a single set to support the arrested President Dilma Roussef when voting for the Senate of the country's official charge.
RT trade between Russia and Iran is rapidly increasing by 71%
After the removal of obligations, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, says the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarya.
After international sanctions against Iran have disappeared, Russian companies have shown great interest in transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“Of course, one of the main objectives of bilateral cooperation in Iran is trade expansion,” Dzhagarya said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 % compared to the same period of 2015, totalling $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5% in total to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to 158 million dollars.
"The growth of the stock was achieved by the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagarya is waiting for a record of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran granted Iran’s citizens about 35,000 visas to travel mainly.
Iran was also the first time among the 20 countries, the most tourists in Russia.
“It is safe to say that the record of last year’s Iranianists in Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, quite few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes to change.
“I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
Skotti Callum Skinner hit the goal of British catching a bike cult
Callum Skinner of Scotland was honored by the team Prince of Men at Rio's Bike Stadium last night, when the British team's three-thirds defended the championship of London for 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role in which his Scotticolega Sir Chris Roy renovated, the legend was proud of a young man when he was confronted with the goal of catching the victory from the New Zealand team.
The UK took the shock win four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his 6 Olympics.
And they repeated the trick since they settled modestly for the sixth of March in the World Championships in London, even though Hoy has decided its race.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Special Ambassador Jamie Staff.
This was done just in time when Hindes appeared.
The end of Hoy also created a vacuum that Kia Emad and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from which the British coachs held the potential in Scotland, which is now a tattoo.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trimester won a double-debate for gold.
Hindes, after his own round, was steadily behind him, but Kenny pulled the team, and Skinner held it up.
The change in the strategy was a major part of the change in the form, and it included Hindes' driving with a bigger shift in order to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to stick to the tactics.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert and drew attention to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the Prize.
Skinner, a 23-year-old glasgow, said, "The blood is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
In the final, we made an Olympic record and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London 2012 with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later revoked his comments, and the British competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with overwhelming profit.
Hindes said, “It felt like it was in London when there were so many British flags on the back.”
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven of ten bicycles in both Beijing and London.
If this describes the development of the last five months, we will be expected to be successful for five days on a bike station.
On the basis of Kenny's properness, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's urection, winning three Olympics in one of the Olympics.
It would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (this apparently holy day in British sport, which is also Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday), would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will compete next in the sprint that begins today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoyed one of these.
The team competition is always the best.
It will be won together with friends.
Winning alone is honestly lonely.”
Hindes said, “If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of the knight.”
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four lives in time, four kilometres in the team.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London, the World Record of Gold 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of competition, where Wiggins will certainly be the center of the attention.
He had a dispute with the judges last night before the times when the officials called him for a length measurement.
In similar women’s competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald progressed in the world recording time at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great track bike team will take over the middle of the Olympics and reach the whole range of medals.
After presenting truly extraordinary and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before Rio races.
The background has had a drama, the least of which has not been the difference between the technical leader Shane Sutton in April due to sexualism and temptation, as well as the end of the competition of majors such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night's competitions in the bicycle station, it seems that the legendary reputation of Britain now rises to its top at the perfect moment could be kept true again.
Portland's unsolicited future due to the Cutting of the Electricity Agreement
The future of Portland Victoria’s aluminum soil, as well as hundreds of workplace jobs, is uncertain when the electricity-sharing electric company revealed that one of the owners of the factory is deciding the distribution agreement, so all distribution contracts are expected to be cut.
The measure follows the earlier decision made by Victoria’s administration this year that the aid required for the maintenance of the factory is not continued.
The aid period of 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk in Alcoan Portland.
Up to 2000 jobs can be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, the snow ball effect can be possible, as the melting consumes about 10% of the total electricity production of Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melt-free, leading to the closure of the Anglese power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's melting loses money and is under the threat of closing.
The measure now follows the speculation of the future of the factory for several years, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the price of the factory production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum soil from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects the three other owners to terminate their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects to continue the operation of the Portland factory, which means that the physical need for unmelted electricity will continue,” he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements", which had to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have 12 months of termination, so they will actually end in 2017.
“For this reason, AGL expects the results of the contracts in 2017,” the electricity company said.
All possible impacts on AGL from 2018 to 2018 are currently limited by the strong prospects of the wholesale electricity market.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts for $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements "does not affect Alcoa's ability to keep melting in operation or to secure unsolicited electricity supply".
The US company said that it signed a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement had to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why the agreement was withdrawn.
The analysts have been guarded both by the unsolicited Portland in Victoria, and also by the possible closure of the Tomago factory near Newcastle, because the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Earlier in the week, AGL's CEO Stephen Mikkelsen told the analysts that Portland used about 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago used about 900 megawatts.
“If both factories leave the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for the [electric] market.
As an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the true-tv star of Kardashians, is on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the United States Vogue's desired September number.
Kendall, a brand-ambassador of Estee Lauder and was a model in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday in his Instagram account.
"Seeing this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a unique (or perhaps only suitable for the Kardashian style?), a manuscripted reality video where the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problems of Rob and Caitly, and with all the favourite entertainment, the Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot the cover of his sister, but ended with a classic translation: they planned a surprise party.
It is a cliché pattern of almost every child's television series (Seacrest says in the words "I don't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of a morning-scheduled puppy), but Kris had to make another girl benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have definitely moved to the new Kardashian era along with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendall’s sister, Kim, may have reached Vogue’s action first (he shared it with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September number of the magazine is quite his own class.
Vogue's September number is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee memorandum than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion, it declined that 615 of last year’s 832-page guide was advertising content).
The exploration of its coverage is expected so intense that for the last two years the pictures of the magazine have leaked before the official publication.
Previous women on the cover have been Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more "publics that work as models" than "models that are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were in the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga's reign.
But if it would happen that Jenner, who is described by his generation as a "good model", would hit the first category mentioned, he would be with quite a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people or today’s young people who can make a good Snapchat video (even Jenner is all of this).
They are legitimately talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year, Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of her career in Lemonade’s publication.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with the success of Jenner.
His real-tv history is always going to be a big deal for Jenner's position in the fashion world.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadidi, calling them "the mother of this moment".
This feeling got up again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But in displeasing it is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September number.
He is a super model in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps that they find behind the payment wall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who he took to the LOVE magazine.
And at his free time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she's a real TV star.
Community legal centres turn 160,000 people away every year
More than 160,000 people’s most vulnerable will be reversed annually from Community legal centres when the sector prepares for the impact of additional funding cuts on its activities at the borders.
In Queensland, three of the five people - mainly old, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance to fight unfair decisions and similars - are already reversed when they seek free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already covered by the Community's borders are preparing for additional cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, head of the legal centres of the Queensland Community, said that, according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being reversed annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not revoked, the situation will only get worse.
“The legal centres of the Queensland Community are chronicly subfinanced, meaning that thousands of people will be reversed annually from the essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrolled and depressing debts, families in housing, unjustly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not receiving the help they need.
The federal government cuts funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected Queensland residents are forced to navigate in the middle of complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice as well as Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the State made its promise to raise the funding of legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and their customer communities, and the government of Palaszczuk should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was challenged after the employee was claimed to be under threat.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was challenged to the court that they said they did nothing after they were told that the campaign's head of North Carolina's operation threatened the employee in February when they drove in Jeep.
The incident was described in the proceedings brought by Vincent Bordin, the former software trainer of the state campaign in Charlotte on Wednesday at the State Court.
Bordini said he waited for months to handle the situation internally before he realized that "this wouldn't happen."
Chief Earl Phillip, "he took out the gun, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe against Vincent's knee sleeve," Bordini said in the cover.
After appealing to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other persons had had similar experience with Phillip, it was said in the action.
“We don’t need to fire the weapons to cause damage,” Bordini said.
The challenge will only be two days after the presidential candidate of the Republicans caused an anger when telling the public in North Carolina that "the people of another addition", which generally covers the owners and armed men, could take action if his competitor Hillary Clinton were elected and elected judges.
Trump’s campaign said that the media has taken his word out of the connection, and that he does not support violence.
Bordin’s challenge is to apply for compensation from the campaign for uninterested supervision and Phillip for violence, assault and emotional disruption.
Hope Hicks, Trump's representative, did not respond immediately to the request for comments.
Companies to reach Phillip did not succeed.
WCCB, a local newsgirl company in Charlote reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call request submitted to his consultant’s Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
Donald Trump’s campaign for the President of the Republic has been controversial.
The case against Bordini is Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the lives of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishment to the whole stomach, not just local communities and all over London.
This was a great charm of Heathrow, as it was also a charm of London 2012, when we saw a huge effort to ensure that all our nations and regions would benefit from the races.
The Olympicians gained huge benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we do that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only local communities will create 10,000 new places of training and 40 000 new jobs and remove youth unemployment from the airport.
Like before the London 2012 races, some will think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for a race and that we would be embarrassed before the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and will be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles must always be overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question that is asked to him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
Enlargement is the opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and 211 billions of £2 billion of economic growth, both to leave the heritage of skills and employment around the airport and around the UK.
In Heathrow, we have a fantastic team that has implemented the 11 billion GBP infrastructure investment programme at the time and in the budget: T5, voted as the world's best airport terminal in five consecutive years, to T2, which was built between the two most urgent runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement a third runway that supports 16 billion dollars of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also that.
It is time for us to channel the lives of the Olympics and to expand Heathrow, to ensure the future of our trade and to create a heritage of skills and employment, which Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is President of Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse games on advertising prevention
For companies that get money from online advertising, companies overturning ads program are "kiss and mouse game", said one of the companies producing this program.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertisers on its computer site, Adblock Plus published a blog in which it was said that users could update the program filters to prevent advertising on the social network websites.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code of its websites would be replaced around advertisements to make it easier for advertisers to detect which parts of the page are advertisements.
But now Adblock says it's been rounding the new code.
In the blog article, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “the battle of this kind between the community that prevents open-source ads and its circumstances has been running since it was invented to prevent advertisements,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon invent its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how great the tragedy of advertisers has become to the industry.
Globally around 200 million people use advertising inhibitors, reported in the last year’s Pagefair and Adobe study. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook with mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company is following advertisers on the computer, as mobile advertisers do not work on Facebook’s mobile applications for a social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer advertising continues to bring enough revenue in order to enable Facebook to consider such a measure worth investing.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it would update its "reputable" tool to give people more power about how advertisements are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also prevent part of the content of the site other than advertising.
“This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to address the problem,” said Facebook’s representative in an email statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
She fell under the car on the Swiss motorway, apparently because of suicide.
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman stayed on the motorway under a number of vehicles on Thursdays early hours, which was apparently suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in Vaud's canton just after midnight.
The woman made a “needed act” and settled in the dark to lie on the road where he was hit by several vehicles, Vaud's police said in the statement.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
A number of drivers involved in the event have already been interviewed, but not all have been identified, the police told that they and all witnesses who witnessed the incident were invited to sign up.
Crime investigation has begun, which is a "loogical" step in this kind of situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
“But let’s see if any of the involved drivers are charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It's gonna be the prosecutor's decision," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases for the last five years indicate that drivers are not held liable.
In both cases - in both cases - there was a person walking in the dark motorway - it was estimated that drivers cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, the police were released from charges for the non-invasion of death after he hit and killed a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and out of the way, and the court was told.
The Court stated that the police who was responding to the emergency call were timed in a justified manner, and that the man’s presence on the road was “experienced and unpredictable,” the judge said.
Everyone who has information about Thursday's case near Morges must call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once to live
According to the NASA’s new climate model, Venus was likely to have once lived.
The scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus’ past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could sometimes be under earthly conditions.
Scientists have previously stated that the slow rotation speed of Venus explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have been a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it could still be slowly rotated.
The model also looked at the early Venus surface formation.
The planet was likely to have more dry areas than Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic variation to allow life and to protect from rapid fluctuations of water.
The advantage of the early Venus was also 30 per cent more thin sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun of the day for almost two months at a time," explained researcher Anthony Del Genio of GISS in the newsletter.
This heats the surface and produces a rain that creates a thick cloud layer, which acts as an umbrella protecting the surface in large respect of the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average temperatures of the climate are actually a few degrees cooler than the current temperatures of the country.
The model produced a story from the development phases of Venus, which is similar to what the planetary researchers had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be living sometimes, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans volatile and its water steams burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, only a thick CO2 atmosphere left behind with deadly greenhouse gas effects - Venus, which we now know.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy retired from the Avalanchen Coach's Pest
Patrick Roy dismissed on Thursday Colorado Avalanche's coach and Vice-President for Hockey, namely the reason for the lack of access to the team's decision-making process.
The Vice President of Colorado/President Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have made my duty as Vice-President of Colorado Avalanche’s Hockey Affairs and as a head coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination," said Roy, aged 50, in the opinion.
I’ve been thinking long and hard about how I can improve this team in order to give it the depth that it needs and to take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the opinion of the Coach and the Vice-President on Hockey should be fully in line with the organisation's view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we hope for him to be happy in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach of the league in its first Avalanche period 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the win of the central division, but Minnesota lost the first round of the Colorado drop-offs, and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
The Avalanchen games ended with 39 wins, 39 loses and 4 matchs, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing a wild card drop-off site for the Western conference.
Hall of Fame's chosen goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cupia - two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
The working struggles of oil workers in the North Sea due to wages are postponed when all the controversial parties sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
The oil field service company against Wood Group has been randomly organised by Royal Dutch Shell’s leading North Sea drilling cars.
"Wood Group, as well as Unite and RMT associations, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process to resolve the current dispute," the joint opinion read.
Over the next few weeks, we will have several full-day meetings early next week so that we can take a fresh review score into problems.
According to the trade unions, their recent work struggle, which they say is the first one for more than 25 years, was an objection to potential, up to 30% wage cuts.
During this year, Wood Group cut the fees of North Sea contractors around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The reduction of the company’s fees will result in a 10% reduction of contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would provide the company with the necessary mobility space to overcome the fall in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people on their paylists and announced their plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries when the company reduces its operations as a result of its giant fusion with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices of crude oil, and this economic situation worsens the UK’s June decision to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Member, Dave Anderson, met the federal leaders this week to discuss one generation of the North Sea's biggest labour disputes.
He said that the North Sea is essential for the economy of the region.
“We need a economy that works for many and not only for few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country,” he said.
In 2016, the North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects, while the average of the last five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Plejad Star Force
The last task of Kepler's astronauts has helped astronomers to collect the most complete list of the speeds of rotation of the stars of the Plejad Star Force.
New information helps astronomers understand why the stars of the Star Force rotate at different speeds, and how the circulars relate to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other Star Forces, we now learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even its solar history,” said researcher Luisa Rebull in the press release.
The Plejad Star Force is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars of the crowd have been born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now on their top level.
At the peak spin speed, these adult stars eject large amounts of stars from the wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
When the star expires, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the appearance of identifiable starlights, such as sunlights.
The latest list of speeds in the stars indicates that the more massive stars rotate slowly than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, of which the larger make the devils slower than smaller.
"In the "balet," we see that slow wheels are usually more massive, while the fastest wheels are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Plejad Star Force is so close, it is ideal for a cosmic laboratory to evaluate the characteristics of the stars at speeds of rotation.
"The Plejad Star Force offers the rotation of anchor stars to the theoretical models that include both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down their spin speed, and so-called hanging their dance shoes on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the speeds of rotation of the Plejads in three articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
