Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kiova’s leadership on Monday that they refused direct political discussions with the Separatists of Eastern Ukraine.
At this moment, Kiev’s leadership does not want to conduct an essential political debate with its country’s eastern part, Putin said the news office according to Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, Kiova and West, said they were assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukraine troops away from their momentary locations in which Putin said that the troops of the Ukrainian army are shooting civilians.
The goal of militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their ammunition so that they can not shoot the inhabitants of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi Repair Center.
It was surprising that the crew had come from the beginning of the evening.
There were visitors waiting for two days, says Promotor Tom Kangas.

In Finland, the law will enter into force on Tuesday, restricting the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the course of the continuation, individuals shall apply for permission from the Police Government to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a ‘explosive’ source.
These substances include vetyperoxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chloride, potassium perchlorate, sodium chloride and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the concentrations specified are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present, for example, in cleaning and washing agents, but the concentrations generally do not exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration drive.
However, prior to the entry into force of the Act, the source materials acquired may be held and used until 2 March 2016.

Valioliiga: Super Raheem shine - Mario remained in the shadow - Valioliiga - Ilta-Sanoma
Only 19 years old Raheem Sterling again showed why he is considered a hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere on Sunday, when Liverpool, a strong Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Marion’s first visit was promising: experienced English journalists saw the 24-year-old Italian working on the field with a different attitude than Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from its top.
The Italians lost three high-quality destinations and feed only half of their sixth feeds to their own team.
The players who have already favoured the game are waiting for better.
Liverpool-manager Brendan Rodgers planted the role of Luis Suarez, who traveled to Barcelona, next to Daniel Sturridge.
The team aims at a kimalsi instead of Balotelli, the top of the midfield diamond, Raheem Sterling, who hit the 3-0 win by the important opening paint of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, it's not just on its power.
Balotelli's 20 cents shorter English is between the opponent's lines than the fish in the water.
Features are not common to a player who praises at the top of the lawn about 34 kilometers per hour.
Rodgers also deserve great thanks for the development of Sterling.
After the match, the North Irish told me how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player of the wembley-growing northwest lobby.

Ovarian cancer is often killed in few areas due to delayed diagnosis and troubled treatment
Angelina Jolie and his brother James have released a video to honor their mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in Australia have a higher risk of ovaries cancer than those living in cities.
Scientists reviewed more than 1100 patients with ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2005 and found that only 35% of women, or more than five years after diagnosis.
The main researcher Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in few residents and distant areas died 20% more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
PIENI TUTKIMUS: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women’s health history over seven years.
According to doctor Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the previous diseases and the socio-economic status affected the possibility of survival.
In older women and cancer, the probability of survival at the time of diagnosis was the smallest.
Women living in rare places and distant areas died 20% more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to find out why women living outside cities have a lower probability to cope with ovaries, but Jordan considers possible reasons for delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment.
"The specialists in genecological oncology treat this disease best, and their reception is mostly located in major cities," Jordan says.
While the treatments carried out as remote services are becoming more common and the importance of distance decreases, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors in order to enable specialists to treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programs to support remotely-care patients.
According to Dr. Jordan’s study, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of their geographical location, which underlines that better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes are needed.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
A 33-year-old family mother in Gold Coasti, Elizabeth Neavella, was found to have malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovanieme wants to strengthen the stationary parking in the Friendship Park, located next to the hotel in Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposal for a status plan for the Friendship Park and its surrounding environment will be placed on the public viewing service point in Osviitta.
The draft plan asks for opinions from the Environment Committee and Lapland Ely Centre.
With a change in position formula, the city wants to allow motorcycle activities related to tourism to continue in the region.
It is intended to form a park area which is within the current Friendship Park and the area between it and the river.
In the event of the presentation, no more than 200 motor rolls are available permanently between 15 November and 30 April.
The area may also be placed in a given part of tanking points.
The new park area is also allowed to operate.
The city of Rovanieme has rented the area of Friendship Park for safari companies for motorcycles during winter.
The lease agreement has been last renewed in spring 2014 and the contract is valid until spring 2018.
The skateparking and the change of the formula have also raised hard-sound resistance.
The people of neighbourhoods have been on their own with both votes and concerns about emissions.
However, the emissions of the area have been studied and there have not been any observations over the guidelines.
Renewed vehicles are also more low than old.
As a parking area, it also supports the fact that, if the place of departure is moved farther, safari customers should transport the hotel to safari departures with buses estimated to be 15 departures a day.
According to the city, the area and the surrounding environment of the friendship park is also sufficiently broad, better than the places to be presented for replacement departures, such as the east side of the Ounas River bridges.
The friendship park is also good for its location so that activities can expand in the future, for example in the Ounaspaviljong region.
Parking is part of the city strategy adopted by the City Council of Rovaniemi, which aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by providing sufficient quality areas to logistically and functionally affordable locations.
The friendship park is also marked as the starting point of the motorcycle in the central public chart, which has not yet gained legal power.
The landscape of property is shown in garden stores
The reduction in the number of residential owners, especially in the group of people under the age of 35, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions when today’s young consumers reach their age for the "primary target group". Financial Times reported the study of the UK Garden Trade Association (HTA).
According to the Financial Times report, apartment rentals use only 55% of the amount used by residential owners for garden management.
The study has also shown that more and more people live in highly urban apartments with no gardens. In addition, the size of the garden decreases when the frontyard is increasingly covered as a parking space. These factors also threaten the garden area with estimated value of approximately £5 billion per year.
In the sub-area of London, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, and garden products are used for the least money per household in the country.
According to HTA and the UK Garden Association (RHS), the increase in the rental of apartments or the reduction of the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the leading garden adviser of RHS, says, "for example, plants grown in transferable educational containers are particularly popular among residential tenants, as such educational containers can be included in the change if necessary."
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the flourishing period of the resale in the garden industry, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the end of the 80s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will increase this year due to better weather conditions, since the last year's March and April's weather was worse.
Turkey interviews US diplomats because of the Spy Report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country’s most experienced diplomat to report on the report on the spying by Americans and British in Turkey.
According to Vice-President Bulent, the U.S. Ambassador and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German Der Spiegel magazine and webpage The Intercept have written that the documents of the former analyst Edward Snowden leaked by the National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main spy target of the U.S. and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan undermined the importance of the report, saying that all major states have spy on each other.
Previous report on the spy targeted by the German main intelligence service in Ankara produced a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.

Mallorcan Magaluf Chief of Police accused of corruption
This case was revealed by the police and Calvià officials in the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's office on Friday.
Calvià's police chief on the Mallorca Holiday Island has been arrested for moisture celebration as a result of the corruption accusations presented by the movement and bar owners of the known Magaluf region.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was imprisoned after several business owners of the Punta Ballena street presented corruption charges against him. The Punta Ballena street is located most of the Maglup bars and nightclubs.
According to Mallorca Diario, according to the publication of the online newspaper, the authorities of the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office provided evidence of extortion by police and Calvià's city government officials on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are interrogated with Navarro.
ABC wrote about the angered authorities of the owners of the nightclubs, which significantly troubled their business.
“There is no longer money, but survival,” one of the owners said to the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries in magazine titles this summer when the YouTube video was online, where the 18-year-old British holidayr had sex with 24 men in the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to reduce the drunken and uncontrolled use of Magaluf lobbyists by reducing the number of participants in malicious, alcohol-driven pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was scheduled to be closed for a year, and the nightclub owner and the pub crawl organiser, Carnage, was jointly imposed on 55,000 euros.
Especially among young British tourists, the popular Magaluf tourist destination has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol use when people have jumped from the balcony to the swimming pool of the hotel.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Season returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bombguards, when rockets and grenades bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli and Hamas war, and schools remained closed when the region recovered from battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket bombs in the southern Israeli communities, but the trails of battles are still visible.
In the southern Ashdod city of Pashosh daycare, workers removed chips from the walls and slipped from the walls and before the children arrived at the rocket in the daycare.
“We’re a little scared, but also excited,” Ronit Bart, who lives in a Saad-named kibbuts, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area need a lot of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks he's going back to school for a long time, feels "a little strange."
“We have sometimes had difficult times when we didn’t leave home anywhere,” he said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbuts near the Gaza border.
Before the beginning of the last week's fire break, thousands of people of the communities of the like-Sales had stayed indoors or left homes to safer areas away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of the Gaza rintama are suspicious about the return of the Palestinian grenades killed by a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, 10 families had not returned yet.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools so far.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited school at Sderot, near the Gaza border, a city under heavy Palestinian fire.
He urged children to study hard and promised that "child training and safety will be cared for".
Israel and Hamas agreed on the current fire break last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the battles, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as the demand of Hamas to remove the Israeli and Egyptian island and to reopen the Gaza air and sea roads.
Israel wants to take away the weapons of Hamas and restore the body of the Israeli soldier who fell in the two wars.
In Egypt, the beginning of the new indirect negotiations will be expected later this month.
Palestinian and UN estimates that more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, of which three quarters were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it had no lasting evidence of this.
On the side of Israel, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai employee.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers shot 4 591 rockets and grenades in most of the cities of Israel in the south.
The Israeli army carried out more than 5000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and estimated 250,000 people escaped to protect more than 100 UNs to maintain schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and during the continuation of battles, school officials moved the beginning of school last week.
“I hope that the school will soon open and we will be able to go back to school, just like other children in the world and just like the Jewish children in the city of Gaza,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old.
According to the generally used meter, housing prices have risen most to seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic apartments in Australia’s capital housing prices increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reflected the RP data on Monday.
As a result, during the summer, July and August, price increases were 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice more than in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen evenly throughout the country.
According to RP Data’s research director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
The results of RP Data show that housing prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent and Melbourne by 11.7 per cent in the previous year.
Adelaiden, Brisbanen and Darwin’s housing markets are the most intense; the average price increase is 5 to 6%.
The weakest housing markets are in Canberra, where prices increased by 1.4% per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring started in Australia increases the number of apartments sold during the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"But taking into account the rise in the sales of auctioned apartments, the overall high sales rate and the continued low interest rates, it is likely that the price of apartments continues to increase over the next three months," Lawless said.
The New Gösta Museum has pulled record audiences from Mänt
The new museum and art have attracted record audiences to Mänt this summer.
By the end of August, the Serlachius Art Museum has visited over 70,000 guests.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June, and there have been classical works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mäntän’s photography week again told me that he performed a visitor record on Monday when the moment event had visited 14 500 interested people this summer.
These figures have not been used to.
The people have shredded from doors and windows,” says the director Pauli Sivonen Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors will come to the Serlachius Museums this year to converge hundreds of thousands.
Over the past few years, there have been around 40,000 visitors.
In the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, there are about 11 000 inhabitants in Mänttä-Vilppula.
The museum director Sivonen reminds us that the new museums are always opening up the phenomena.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art season will continue far beyond the summer.
In the autumn Art Museum, new exhibitions will be opened.

Lenny Henry says, My father never hugged me.
He never said he loves me.
Henry was born to a seven-year-old family of migrants from Jamaica in Dudley in the British Midlands region in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19, and his relationship was distant.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records comedyshow, which is partly based on his father's imaginary discussion and developed on the basis of the series of Radio 4 channels.
The sound tracks are a mix of reggae and rape in upbeat.
Henry has had to go through the painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times after his mother’s death, and he is considering a lot of his relationship with his father.
Dad was very difficult to read.
His face never appeared, only the voice said, Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of the beer or the beauty of the cricket.
I never talked to him about such things.
Most of my life he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal filtration plant in Dudley, and so he realized what his father’s life must have been like, although working conditions are better now than at that time.
Nowadays, melting houses are a little lighter, but they are practically dark, smoked, labyrinthic depths, where flames, smoke, and noodles come to mind.
The father used to go to a bath and only the ground in the bathtub, and slowly he began to sing himself when he washed the dirt of the melt.
When I walked around the Sulattamo, I realized that he had been doing it for years to get us a food table, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry’s childhood lacked the closeness offered by parents.
My father never hugged and never said he loved me.
Only when my mother began to suffer a little before she died, we began to repeat each other that we love each other.
Henry has a daughter of Billie Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love he lacked when he was a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you"?
Stop huging!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn with French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend with France, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to mother’s death.
When I began to suffer from a lot of overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
Then I started with a lot of exercises, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce symptoms.
It's very difficult...
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may describe his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from the critics of his role as Othello, he is embodied in making the theater.
The next was the Comedy of errors and August Wilson's Fences ("Aidat").
Making theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and the comedy Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry only started working in the industry when he was 16 years old.
A dishman noticed him doing imitations on the stage and contacted the New Faces performance competition.
Henry's TV career started in the middle of the 70s. "How long was I the only black imitator and comicist on TV," he says.
Henry learned to work.
I had to grow up in the light bowl of the public, I had to learn to make jokes from the sliding straw in 1975-1985, while the starship of the body and I was on TV. It was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had the right to play at The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared black skins in makeup, so Henry ended up as a comic program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and detrimental, I was able to work in huge events and learn how to deal with the public.
However, the “britti-tv’s awarded, multi-year favorite and light entertainment program” was “short parody of black people.”
Henry worked in a second comedy series in the 80s, where both ruined and admired the black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and Henry was known in the 90s as his cook Gareth Blacklock as a comedy series in Chef!
Henry spent the next decade with advertisements, documents, TV series and film sections, but after his LennyHenry.tv series in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len, now it seems like you're just on your spot or on the sidelines."
Next was the radio 4 channel documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part was Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not actually taught properly in school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class that uses socks and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's theme raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, “Come on.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
I want you to meet words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 rays about Othello's last speech for the document and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt like some of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
“This is what it is, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your word, do a small background study.
The training process was rough, and I read the play for months before it was done.
The exhibition was ultimately a success.
It was probably expected to fail, but that was not exactly what happened.
Soon afterwards, Henry played the main part in the Comedy of errors.
Suddenly, I acted at the British National Theatre, and I couldn’t really believe it.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There were technical problems once in the play, and Henry clearly felt that his job was to entertain the public.
"The small voice in my mind said to me, "You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again."
Instead, the assistant of the director announced that the presentation will continue as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the scene, and some of me shouted the relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role"
Henry "Fences" in the Duchess Theatre
Learning the "Fences" show was challenging.
Panique is a good thing, it makes people more sustainable.
This play was also well accepted, so it was like a sign of gods; “This is what you have to do.”
This is what Henry is saying, of course, in a loud voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I really love this job.
I love the gyms.
However, Henry is still basically a comic: small humorboys are constantly interrupting our discussion when he switches from imitation to another.
Avoiding stand-up comics is a question of will, as receiving immediate gratitude from an unknown public seems dangerous.
If you're constantly thirsty, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but generally it will no longer inspire me in the same way as before.
I'll ask Henry if he's going to a new stand-up tour.
I am truly happy to sit with the instructor, which helps me edit the entire journey from the beginning, the middle stage and the end, and I don’t think that I would ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new birth?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really fun.
The show constantly tells the story, and in that task I enjoy.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenia draws up a register of officials to remove "famous workers"
Kenia has started to draw up a biometric register of officials when attempting to remove "homeworkers" from the board's paylists.
Employees who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer receive salaries, the government's announcement was made.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still be paid salary after they leave their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to break down the corruption of the public sector after entering office in 2013.
According to the previous audit this year, at least a million dollars were spent on wages and other economic abuses.
The government suspects that wages will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his official mission, the BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reports about Nairobi.
All officials shall report themselves to the register during the next weeks at the identification centres in order to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration form, it was reported in the Government’s Communication.
According to the newsletter, any person who fails to do this without proper reason shall be removed from the paylists.
"This measure will make the public sector a significant sense, as it defines how many people really work in their tasks. In addition, it will clean the paylists at both levels of the government. This will solve the problem of "homeworkers"," says Anne Waiguru, the Office official of the minister responsible for decentralisation and planning.
The result of the 2015 financial year may remain EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure developments in a tight economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual ceiling is about 9.4 million deficits.
The possibility of improving the scope and level of services was to be covered, as well as the purchases of services, the sale and grants of property, and the increase in tax and payment revenue.
The investment target of EUR 10 million is 8.5 million.
There is no relief in the situation of the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on the municipalities, the insufficient increase in tax revenues, the increase in unemployment and the 5% cut in state shares further undermine the prospects.
The aim of the economic seminar is to look for new ways to balance the economy.
The city government is unanimous that savings must be achieved.
The ship must be translated into a strategy-based goal, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Government.
The city government restored the presentations made for the preparation of the management group.
The City Government's proposals are the basis for the budget preparation in the Parliament's economic seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
Following the mandate seminar, the draft budget will proceed through the Board of Directors to the city government and to the City Council.
Twenty Turkish police officers are arrested as suspected of "joon" against the government
Overall, 33 police officers have been arrested as suspected of "government against government" in Turkey, local media sources say.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-quality police officers were arrested.
Some of the police were connected to the government officials, including four government ministers, last December’s corruption investigations.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey for the organisation of a broad criminal community and the monitoring of phones.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister during that period) said the police activities were part of the action planned against Fethullah Gullen, the Islamist Director.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of Ukraine’s schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditionally important day for families, and as with thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took her daughter to school.
At the same time, he told prospective journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September was not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace across Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the whole Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is a leading teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yatsenyuk's daughter goes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back and that children can learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first school day include traditionally children’s written shirts, balloons and flowers for teachers.
According to Texas Perry, the tweet was unauthorized.
During this hearing, a picture of the democratic district attorney was sent from the Twitter account established by Texas Governor Rick Perry on Sunday night.
Tweet was later removed and followed by a new tweet where Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent out of my account unauthorized.
“I don’t accept the tweet and I have removed it,” the later publication said.
Perry's background forces did not respond immediately to clarification requests.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's fixed Twitter account, it is unclear who released the picture.
The first twitzer included a remarkable tweet of Travis’s district advocate Rosemary Lehmberg, condemned by the Drinking Drinking in April 2013.
Perry prevented Lehmberg's official funding when it refused to resign, which led to the meeting of the large jury in Austin this month when Perry was accused of. Perry is a possible candidate for the 2016 presidential elections.
Tweet's title was: "I'm not always driving drunk, three times allowed with larger proms... but when so happens, I'm going to blame Governor Perry for showing her finger."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg office did not lead a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio, appointed by the Republican Judge.
Perry said he was innocent and called the accusations politically.
His influential legal assistance team has asked the judge in question to reject the accusations and said that the law under which the most disproportionate governor of Texas was accused is unprecedented against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million state aid to a public infringement unit operating in Travis County and treating public-sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry’s decision was brought to the left by an official complaint from the follow-up group.
Perry’s Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes famously.
After reaching the fifth place at the Iowa Election Conference in its 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the line by publishing a picture on Twitter on its own on the lake "That's where we come, South Carolina!".
Berkeley said the housing market is "normal" again.
One of London’s most important builders has warned that Southeast England’s housing markets have “returned” to the normal level of activity.
The capital of London’s apartments have been undermined by huge demand and sharp price increases while fearing a widely spreading credit coupon, which led the Bank of England to set restrictions on housing loans in June.
The founder of Berkeley and President Tony Pidgley of the high-level builder said on Monday that “the market and the number of shops have returned to normal after the year 2013,” and added that this has enabled a “stable operating environment”.
During the recession of London’s housing market, foreign investors went well to the capital in their livestock.
According to the country register, the prices of apartments in the city increased by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley’s private, affordable and student buildings rose in the last five years, reaching £423,000 by the end of April.
However, a fixed pound has made London's property less attractive in recent months - part of the interest has also been influenced by new real estate tax laws and political retourism from a possible "card tax" before the general elections of May.
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported more stringent lending orders, would lead to a lower market growth level in terms of both the sales volumes of property and prices in the second half of the year.
The recent data from the Bank of England showed that the number of approved loans decreased in July, which refers to the cooling housing market.
The property broker Hamptons International has declined its 2015 forecast for London property prices, according to which, prices will fall by 3%, since the index of housing owners’ opinion prices has already weakened.
The number of shops made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen in a quarter of a year ago, the property broker WA Ellis says.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, who raised income from the sold property to over 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added that “the demand for a well-designed, correct product in the best locations has remained stable, and therefore the sales have remained vigilant.”
In June, the company said he sold 3 742 new homes in the year preceding April. This is almost a third more than the top of the financial crisis in 2007.
The annual profits calculated prior to taxes increased by 40% over the year, thus £380 million and turnover increased by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
Pidgley told on Monday before the company's annual meeting that Berkeley's earnings correspond to the market's current expectations.
The analysts agree that the profit of the year before taxes is 450 million.
In the afternoon, Berkeley’s shares sold on the London Stock Exchange at a price of 23,96 pounds.
Hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures on the network
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Annual Academy Awards Awards Awards.
A hacker who claims to hold a hundred other pictures of Oscar's actress Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures on the web.
The star of hunger confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned the hacker for "failing privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and everyone who publishes the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will get accusations.
The photos originally published on the 4chan image publication page were apparently lost due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. On the list of hundreds of other hacking stars, there are tens of other females, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashi, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed, said.
It is not known how much of the images are real, although Scott Pilgrim against the World star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at pictures taken in the privacy of my husband and me years ago: hopefully you have a good mind," your Winstead twitta.
However, the Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series prohibited the authenticity of the images and your twitate that "that's what's called naked images I think are DEFINITIONS, don't you understand."
Let me finish this right in the beginning.
BuzzFeed announced late Sunday that the pop star Ariana Grande's representative banned the authenticity of the images about the star.
Only the new novel that Howard Jacobson has given thanks to us, which tells us about love and j letter.
They were dissolved, it described the best thing that happened, gradually they were dissolved from each other than the rain left in the paperboard box.
Only occasionally, he heard from a woman that was too serious, intensive, intensive, distracted, and perhaps a little bit slick.
Then he squeezed his hand.
He recognized the lyric.
Yeah, he was slick like a silk.
His last victim had been in the beginning, however, a relationship that had been promising; it had appeared that this relationship could have made his lonely boring easier, and it might have brought even some content in his life.
Ailinn Solomons had unstoppable hair, and he was a delicate, delicate, beautiful heart of joy, from the northern village, which was even harder and farther than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling partner, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. Aunt had inherited the house that was located in a wet but Paradise valley, and the valley’s name was appropriately the Paradise valley.
There was no one in the house for years.
The tubes bled, all the bathrooms had spiders, the ethanes had left their tracks in windows, keeping the whole place in their own, and the garden grew rich grasses, which reminded me of the giant rainbows.
The cottage was like a story of children, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
According to Howard Jacobson, the novel "J" is subject to the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
Conditions will be published next week
Kevern had sat in hand with Ailin with broken terrace chairs in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprising warm spring afternoon, both deliberately listening to the reception, through which the whole country heard calming music and calming news when the crossings of Ailin, the brown feet of the sun brought to Kevern’s mind a song that had long ago been forgotten by the black-blooded performers and his father had often listened to the cabin rays down.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were originally too aggressive and no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned – nothing was actually banned – they were not just called anymore.
They wanted to leave them unforgettable, as did the word themselves.
The general opinion made what was not achieved by the law and the publication: just as in the literary field people chose to read the memorials of heroes, cookbooks and romances, for music they prefer ballades.
When Kevern was devastated in the day, Kevern began to imaginary piano and sing a serenade to Ailin's big legs with a rude comic voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song from jazzpianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and naturally lifted two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the "j" letter was able to escape from his lips.
It was started as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father told me he played the same game with his father.
If you let the word j begins with your mouth, and you didn't remember raising two fingers before your mouth, you had to pay for a penny.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't too funny.
He knew he was expecting it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of that.
Jazz was not actually declared banned, it was not just called.
Improvising was no longer in fashion.
There was room in life for only one word.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it ended.
That was the same way for Intelligence.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was the smartness of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, Jazz music had become familiar with him through his father's spouse's CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Considering the age of Ailin, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for law or force.
A loud society meant that each of its parts was accepted as grateful – thankful – for saving them like a happy trade – the principle that each group did natural things to him.
Based on their Temperament and physical characteristics, people with afro-Caribbean genital roots are best suited to entertain and athlete, so they sang and run.
Originally, those from the continent of India were like naturally talented with electrical equipment, so their task was to ensure that each family had a working phone used to handle things.
Those left of the Polish community worked as pipeliners; the last Greeks broke the plate.
When SE, WHEN THESE, JOS TAPAHTU, came true, they were from the Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled vividly in fear of being accused of fleasing and fearing that the flames would reach them next, opened restaurants in which labneh yogurt was served and burned water pipe, and continued their lives to look at the ground as created and bored.
Everyone should act according to their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballades, and it was hard for him to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just singing had ever been able to wear music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the big legs think.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of the giant cabbage leaves.
I still didn't get it.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to lift two fingers with his lips with Ailin.
She thought she was weird now.
"It was funny," he said.
Ailinn fell his head incredibly, and his hair covered Kevern’s vision.
There's nothing else to see in the whole world than Ailin's huge, shades of hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
“If you say that,” he said, but he didn’t sound convincing.
But it doesn’t explain why you sing it to me.
The bird seemed really confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked at me again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your nipple, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for it.
"You're charming because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
It didn't help.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to entertain, the effect was completely different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite their favorite eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from the terrace chair and shred the receiver and shined the wine they had just been drinking.
The wine was made of just a backbone, so he couldn’t use it as a cause of the crash.
In her nervousness, she seemed to shake like palm tree leaves in the storm.
“And your thick head is what crawledly charms me in you,” he said.
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Alinn, both for his own unnecessarily cruel words and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment that Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he was gonna hit?
He had never told Kevern about his life in a hymn northern island, where he had grown, but Kevern was confident that basically it had been the same as life here.
The same great, hygienic sea that waved against them.
The same confusing men, however, after TAPAHTUNUS, even more slim and devilish than their smuggler and dispersing grandparents, walked from the pub to the pub, ready to hit every woman who dares to resist or rubble them.
A thick head?
He'd see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
First, kissing had become the most common word of the erotic encounter of a man and woman; the antidote of the insignificant love ballads that pump out the receiver, first suck and then attack.
Kevern also thought that it was too much, because the immersion itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of the sorrow of Kevern surprised him.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him, just as his traveling partner watched Kevern go out the upstairs window, a man who was himself responsible for his heavy life.
Adam leaves the garden, he thought.
He felt compassion for Kevern and men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike him.
Turning his mind into a disgraceful, shameful, defeated man who had lost all the battle to him—why did he feel that that the vision was so familiar to him even though he didn’t remember that he had ever seen that before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, a intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private facility measuring the General Mindstyle, conducted a brief study on the continuation of small and medium-sized violence in the areas of the country where the decline of violence, or the end of violence, was most likely to take into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
“A lot has already been accomplished, and a lot has not yet been done,” he wrote, “which can be compensated for thousands of years in the natural aggressiveness of the winning people, especially in those abandoned and out-of-the-art collars, where, despite the shrines over the fences, human legacy has been rarely known in the time of time.
However, some things will not be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the minds it gives.
The people cry with sentimental ballads, ahm the stories of contradictions and swears in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, while the old-fashioned cruelty is held in an unsolicifiable take-up of both rural communities and urban cosmetics, and there is evidence of a new, malicious opportunity to fight at homes, at workplaces, on our streets and even in playgrounds.
"You have a regrettable tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped his eyes on the ground.
I have to ask: Are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer that,” Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "as I oppose atheism, lesbian sexism and feminism.
This job does not hold prejudices.
We are unprecedented servants of society.
Although a certain type of hypersensitivity is self-acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you have just presented to me.
Obviously, you have something against the church – and what you call cruel or evil soul, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
It's like it happened yesterday, if it happened above all, it's destroying the country's fundamental vital vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around when he spoke to Rabinowitz.
Rabinowitz's head behind the flamingo pink LED light proclaimed the instructions that Ofnow had given to the country for a quarter or longer of the previous century.
Smile your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballades, visit musicals, use your phone, discuss, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence and a songful word is better than written, but nothing wins love.
“I understand well what you want to say,” Esme Nussbaum responded with a quiet voice when he was sure that his director had stopped, “and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will notice that we repeat the same mistakes that originally led to SIIHEN, what the hell is going to happen, JOS TAPAHTU.
This time, however, we do not pour out our hatred and our distrust to others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "When you're depicting 'feeds' the actions that our grandparents may have done or not done.
You will also go too far when you say that they bled their hatred and their untrust to others.”
A person like you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about "we" or "they".
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
It was time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
“If we are fairly honest, in that chaos,” Esme dared to continue, “No group of society can say that he was acting well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was good or bad.
Then it was.
We don’t have to talk about it anymore – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is also no need to make corrections, whether they were appropriate or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But for what is the past then, if you don't learn from it...
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and said, "It's time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as usual, he was hit by a motorcycle on a pedestrian, whose drivers described his driving as "devil and angry".
There's an accident.
The Lesothon Army denys its planned attack; the Prime Minister stays in South Africa
The officials of the Lesotho Army have refused to set up an attack on the government's assault and said that they were against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane escaped from the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official apartment and conquered government buildings in the capital city of Masero.
The Head of State traveled with his family to the neighbourhood of South Africa after telling that he had been killed.
Major Ntlele Ntoi, the Army spokesman, said that the army responded to this threat from "political fanatics".
"The Lesothon's defense forces took action after a number of intelligence data that some police forces attempt to arm young party fanatics when they were prepared to cause problems," he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to Clayson Monyela, the president of the South African government, the military acted as a revolutionary attempt.
"Although no one has claimed to revoke the government by means of force, the actions of Lesotho's defense forces seem to be all sides equivalent to the signs of the revolutionary company," he said.
The officials of the Lesothon Army said the soldiers would return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital was a peaceful atmosphere.
In the meantime, Vice-President Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government when Thabane is missing.
Thabane says he believes that he is in action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There has been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended the sessions of the Parliament due to the divergences of the large coalition government.
He denys this denial of the power of the government, even though it is said otherwise.
Commercial page: Microsoft establishes a data center in New Country
Microsoft has established a large data center for New Country, where the company does not agree to specify its location.
In the newsletter sent to Microsoft media, the company notes that it does not tell the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is a investment of hundreds of millions for Microsoft.
In the public, the location of the Centre was previously betten by Oulu or Kajaan.
Microsoft will complete Oulu’s office, which will take about 500 people to work.
Overall, Microsoft has announced to resign up to 1 050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft communication director Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company does not comment on how much the new data center employs.
The establishment of the Data Centre to New Zealand told the Commercial Journal on Monday.
The man is accused of being attacked by a girl in the traffic lighting

Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, you have several different devices to choose.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $ 350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that should be followed.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are waterproofly closed.
In addition, set camera description settings to match images or videos to be taken.
Some cameras or camera and video camera combinations have a setting to optimize the description conditions below the water.
In addition – before jumping into the water, make sure how deep your device can be taken.
Some cameras only hold 5 feet of depth, others up to 50-60 feet of depth.
Explore both ordinary and waterproof models in our purchase guide and reviews of digital cameras.
Take a number of photos – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have a LCD display that allows you to combine the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have LCD, it’s hard to see underwater, and contemplating the image can either succeed or fail.
So take a number of pictures.
If your camera also allows for a scratch, which means taking multiple images at a time with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
Light decreases significantly by deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you describe the pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the observable object.
This is an important advice on the land, but even more important underwater, because light conditions are weak.
It is very important when an action camera is used: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide pickular, i.e. the pictographer must be close to the target so that the object meets the entire frames of the picture.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protesters swear to revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not choose candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing, democratic reform demanding peacelessness.
The decision is likely to allow a spark of Hong Kong’s business world block to plan and implement demonstrations only hours after the publication of the decision.
The Chinese People's Congress's decision in practice gives Communists the power to eliminate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
“This was expected, but it’s still annoying,” says President of the Democratic Party, legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to Hong Kong.
It is clear that we work with an independent administration.
Vice-President Li Fei of the People's Congress of China, defended the Chinese administration, saying that the general candidate for the Hong Kong leader would be too chaotic.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom gave up Hong Kong China, Beijing promised the residents of the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, the Sunday decision was a democratic breakthrough, as it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the appointment committee managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” are accepted.
During the summer preceding the decision, Hong Kong held some of the largest and most remarkable protests in the region for years.
The campaign was largely behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which has been threatened by organizers to prevent the operation of the business world block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the publication of the decision, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in front of the Hong Kong headquarters.
In the opinion, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move to a new era of uncivilization and would lead to protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not reveal the details, apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In the communications published in the network, the organisers said that the movement “to consider Occupy Central as the last way to be introduced only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way.”
We are very sorry when we announce that today's last chance to dialogue has gone away and that the takeover of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong's authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security operations were strict near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, there is a lot of people’s feeling that people are slowly losing power from their city.
The wave from the mainland has caused competition for products and services.
There is also fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the increasing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong’s living conditions – the business world.
"The test they are talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people participate in it and how long it lasts," says Legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We don’t want to be concerned about Hong Kong being swept away from us.
Such an impression would be bad for investing.
The media of the Chinese state also presented stories that Hong Kong’s democracy activists are the hands of the Western powers of the Revolution.”
This summer, activists held a referendum on non-formal voting rights, involving 780,000 people – more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations in the region's democracy.
Your U.S. prom tradition hits UK universities: for new students private prints
We are excited to respond to demand by establishing the UK’s first luxury class travel form for students today.
In addition to a private airplane, the company also offers other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most remarkable arrival of the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a security aspect of the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property through the country through their borders in cars loaded.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer students today as easy and high-quality transportation to the university as possible.
According to the company's representative, reservations have not yet been made because the service has just been established, but added that "the students will start the orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is a demand for the service, even though most students pay 9 000 pounds of academic year fees.
Students today are very different from those of their expectations and wishes than 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago began their studies. Now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organization criticizes the service that is not realistic.
According to the Vice-President Megan Dunn of the Department of Higher Education, this service plan seems to be very far from the life of the student majority.
Many of this month’s studies start shocking the level of living costs when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has remained after a huge increase in basic living costs. Only then can you begin to wonder where thousands of people would be used for such a simple matter as to get to campus.

Basketball: Fans intensification almost too much: Sasu Salin was fainting on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the body of Finland’s victory today.
He was able to forget the sysimus of his US match and blew the bloods of Ukraine with their other half-time solutions.
But Salin moved all the honor to sushifans and made it in style:
I was going to faint there at the end of the field, it was so great.
In my eyes, it was my sum, there was nothing.
That noise and the white public sea were almost too much for me.
The power moments of the salin contained nine surfaces at a fast pace, ballots, discs and temmelships everywhere where it happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow mode that everything worked out.
They only come from someplace, now in an intelligible place, Sasu shined.
It's my role.
Do all that.
It was great to see the others get caught in the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
The hall is a team of joy pillars and lifestyles, so it’s no wonder that his example raised the entire team to a flight that was too big and hard tough for Ukraine’s five.
Finland in the MM races after 32 years of break: The previous ones remembered a rude judge game
Heikki Montonen (oik.) was the main coach of Finland at the MM tournament of Argentina in 1982.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish Flyball Team played the last time at the end of the MM.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach of Finland and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as yesterday: it was a hot match against France.
“In the match’s resolution balls, the judge’s game was rude,” Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams were already set on the back line.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the fats got more confused," Parkkali said.
Finland played the main coach at Heikki Montose's command and eventually settled in the 17th.
Now Finland is among the world’s elections, as the MM tournament in Poland is on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in the international balloon over 32 years.
The players’ power values are about the same class as before, but the quality and skills are now more.
The players’ averages have also increased.
The game is faster," thought Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to continue from the initial block.
Then you can get tight,” Kosonen evaluates.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a winning match against Tunisia.
The current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the MM tournament.
Let's hope we're going to be betrayed by the 17th position.
South Korea and Tunisia should go awkward,” Parkkali said.
Specieslegenda Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the country team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö winded up in the Tunisian match.
The Sauna and Night Harbour at the Buenos Aires Maritime Church were part of the land team’s program at the 1982 MM tournament.
Kari Kalin (oik.) stretched with his teammates.

The Finnishists rescued the Cita dog from the mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks."
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs got into trouble on the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini boldly offered help.
On the weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for "International heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers again.
In the public Facebook update, Mikkelsen told him that Cita dog on the mountains of Thursday hurt her bowl.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in a steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I didn't succeed, so I had to let it go.
I tried to attract and pull it a little further, but its legs didn’t just carry it, Mikkelsen wrote in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, from the nearby hotel, or from the passers.
In the dark of the night, the situation began to appear to be threatening.
Fortunately, there were two walkers who were willing to help: Tamperean Antti Soini and his father Tuomo.
Men had visited the highest mountain in Norway at Galdhøpiggen and were heading to his camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm from the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells me in the message sent to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon there was also a German man who had a hiking mattress with him.
Citalle was received from the mattress in a couple of ways to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came in a moment after us, when we had thought of what to do with the dog and carried the dog in a moment in the arms of the chest, Soini says.
KUVA: Tuomo Soini
The dog could be carried down with a trip.
According to Soin, performance was not physically heavy, but it went slowly in the difficult landscape.
However, in about a half hour, Cita was happy to get down.
After the event, Mikkelsen was still looking for "International heroes" on Facebook so that he could thank them again.
Soins responded to him on Sunday, but the German man is still unacceptable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen will be happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have returned.
I'd like to find these people because I feel I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
On Monday night, Soins were on their way home.
They had gotten Mikkelsen happy to say: "Cita says he's feeling better!"

Genetic abnormality is often diagnosed wrongly.
The British woman was afraid of death for years because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years of life left because he was diagnosed with another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth’s disease (CMT), which means a set of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
According to the Charity CMT UK Goodness Organization, the wrong diagnosis is a general problem in CMT cases because it is known as so little.
According to estimates, about 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motorics, such as muscle weakness, difficult walk and toes.
The disease may also cause unconsciousness or pain, and it is unparalleled and progressive, meaning that symptoms will worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he would suffer from Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) with a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would get into a wheelchair before he filled 18 and die before he reaches 30 years of age.
Today, the mother of two children, 51 years old, says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I fell a day and lasted longer than others.
I was never able to roll or roll with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than the others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was performed several cuts of a person's ring to direct his legs. In the event of surgery, he quickly looked at his research papers that said he was suffering from a FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but after coming home, I checked the disease information in the library and wrote to the FA association," he said.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I fill 25, and in the meantime I would lose my entire capacity.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers said by the age of 17, he said that his walk was not worse than he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "girl gold, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you would already be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something much less dangerous.
According to some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was explained what the CMT disease is, I thought I was postponed," he said.
Charity CMT UK organises a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.

Copenhagen: We have good chances of winning
The wishes of the basketball team for the post are in the game when Finland meets Ukraine today in the second match of the MM competitions.
If the opening loss for the United States was expected, Ukraine belongs to the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance to win, Petteri Koponene predicts.

Hollywood stars are supposed to spread online - part secured as real
A number of naked images are spread on the Internet, allegedly representing well-known publicities.
Among other things, actress Jennifer Lawrence has become the victim of a "snake campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published a angry comment from Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a serious breach of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (Internet) the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged, the representatives will be threatened.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the pictures that spread about him are genuine.
He had taken these pictures years ago with his husband.

There are also real or fake naked pictures of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka-Mail Controller criticizes his own: “You don’t work enough to get out of here.”
Football club FC Honka is currently the last place of the Veikkausliiga.
After the Sunday VPS match, Walter painted the incredible comments, they illustrate the confusional situation of the club.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach for four months.
But everything has to be adapted," Viitala said after the end of the fight.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the first half of the game.
The painter was not a bad defense game.
Player traffic has been in Hong Kong this summer, and therefore the defenders in front of the Viila have also changed to a tiny pace.
With the gamer's story, many young players have gained opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"Osa doesn't work enough to get out of here sometimes," Viitala smuggled without a name of any individual player.
Honga’s chief coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitalan.
“I told certain players after the game that if you come to exercise and games to have fun and think you’re a betting player, and you don’t have to work, you’re probably wrong in the team,” Kuqi said.
I've given many young people play time.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also recalled that players cannot expect immediate success when gambling friends are constantly changing.
This season has not had the same composition twice.
Particularly in the defense, the people have changed.
That's the biggest reason why we're here," Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a serial jumbo, in the second place with the last TPS.
There's still seven rounds left, so the espools still have time to avoid falling into one.
I've never dropped the team, and I'm not gonna drop it now.
We are not going to drop out of this series," the goalkeeper Viitala threatened.

In Athens’s races, the Finnishs were known to have been there a little over 100.
This includes journalists, relatives of players, Finnish basketball coachs and a few fans.
Bilbao also has journalists, relatives and coachs, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
I don't think anyone can say a good number of Finnish tourists.
The estimates have moved between 7 500-10 000.
There was a number between that time, that's an incomprehensible number.
Here is an explanation for sports social beings.
In the global world economy, businesses move across borders.
There is still a chance to see how we are doing internationally.
As we increase mobility, we can visit our girls and our sons to see how they succeed in the world, says Professor Hannu Itkonen.
There are definitely Finnishs in both Spain and the MMs of the aircraft ball in Poland who are looking for a lifetime.
Co-experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
In sports itself, there must be attractiveness.
Itkonen raises sport into a popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to athletes than to Berlin to watch art.
Without success, masses will not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
The main coach, Dettmann, challenged the basketball union and players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the country team was raised on the leg.
The plane crew made the same movement a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sports where holy trinity works: sports media sponsors.
The public will also be interested.
And the media has taught me what such carnival support is, Itkonen reminds me.
Can ball sports move this massive interest to home series as well?
The basket and airball are played on average for hundreds or slightly over a thousand viewers.
The cryon considers the question to be good, and it does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good to the species.
Another school believes that interest will move.
The other one is the one who doesn't want sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for a lifetime trip to the MM, but in their basic thinking, the domestic series are not twice interested.
It has a challenge for the co-workers in the middle of the drug.
Bottaksen tons - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola rewards the formula driver at Valtteri Bottaksen beach house.
The government unanimously approved the donation of 1.4 hectares in its meeting on Monday.
In the future, a leisure home will rise to the property.
The success of Bottakse has been monitored in Nastola since this maping time.
He is known as a good ambassador to market Lahtea, Bay's region and Nastola.
The gifttont is located in Koiskala, Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become owned by the Nastola municipality as part of the bigger real estate trade.
There are seven buildings in the area, of which the municipality will be dismantled at the expense of six by the end of this year.
Bottas reached the formula 1 in the Belgian Participation Competition this year.
He's at the MM points in the fifth.
Bottas is a born Nastolian and lived with the Vilallika of his child.
He now lives in England, but he visits Nastola whenever it's free of formats.
Bottas has visited high schools and youth facilities.
Design Intelligence Clothes come, but hardly for the poor.
It presents and tests them at the U.S. Open competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are the ball character of the field, but also amateur Marcus Giron, who belongs to the top of university gambling.
According to him, the shirt helps him follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nail shirt has been fabricated with silver sensors, of which the information is transmitted to a shirt and from there to a smartphone or a tablet computer.
The sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythms, stress and steps.
The central unit bucket is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The Fashion House has not told me the exact time to start selling the shirt, nor did you even suggest the price, Tech Times news.
Raph Lauren is not the only company to put on smart clothes.
Californian Athos has brought a smart shirt and smarthorses for sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The cost of clothes is $100 per piece and the center unit of the thumb required by them will pay two hundred dollars.
Red Orbit also wrote about tech opatics.
A smart way to save books
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder’s second year of study invented a smart way to save costs.
He developed a system in which students of later year courses borrow their books against nominal compensation instead of selling the books forward immediately.
"My Mathematics book would normally have paid $180; I paid $10 for the entire semester and a shovel sandwich," says Schroeder, a 19-year-old, studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his last semester books would normally cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University Board, the average student spends over $1200 per year on books and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students end up using more and more creative approaches such as online shops and Schroeder's idea.
More and more students hire textbooks, so they can use the book throughout the semester and pay clearly less than the book buying students.
According to Neebo Inc, over 250 campus books stores, the rental of books has doubled since 2011.
Statistical data on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books of universities were rented in the spring, says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are acquired from campus books.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online trades
In online stores, the new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would pay for in the campus bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book's ninth edition is a recommendation price of almost $290, but Chegg.com's book is paid for $239.99.
Buy as Used
The books used are a good option if the reader does not disturb other notes and the past appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book will be used for Chegg.com online stores at $ 93.49.
Brigham Young University's last year student Matt Casaday, 25 years, says he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business" at the Amazon.com web shop for only $0.42.
As a new book, it would have cost 48 dollars.
Ingrid Bracey and other academics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls recommend that students ask their professors if previous prints can be used on the course.
At times, the reforms of the new pressure are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old pressure can only be found with a fraction of the price that should cost the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookshops, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy books used.
Rental
You should consider renting your books if you take good care of them, remember to return them and you won’t need them after the course is completed.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for the whole semester cost about $20.
Explore the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the use of the highlight cylinder and the following charges.
Rentals, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the delay fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-mails
Acquiring e-books instead of ordinary papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented to pay for the right of use of an e-book to its owner, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store will receive an e-book of "Calculus" for six months at about $61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most, because many classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
Comparing different sellers is worth what option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, which will soon begin in Pepperdinen's legal science, recommends using the book ISBN in order to determine the price, as it will help you to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order the network, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this through the heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was in ice for four weeks, and he finally had to get the book at the university's bookstore at a full price.
Tampere Legion Theatre fills 20 years
The theatre established in 1994 opposes unemployment, exclusion and passiveness.
Everyone who wants to do a show art is welcome.

Almost double death in fires compared to last year
This year, almost twice the number of people died in fires compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Rescue Organization (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires.
Last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There were 11 people over the age of 65.
According to the organisation’s statistics on fire deaths, the worst situation was last in 2009, when 64 people were killed in fires by the end of August.
Most of the fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in flat houses, 21 home houses, and seven in rows and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of replacing home fire safety.
At least the functioning of all home burners should be ensured by Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the launching equipment is easy to use.
All home premises must also have an unavoidable exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when they are at home alone.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO Summit protested at Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the city center of Newport to the Nato marshal.
On Sunday there were about 150 people meeting at the Cardiff City Hall, the so-called Summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events this weekend and spoke with protesters who had arrived even since Belgium.
Young people were rescued by flight from the Blue Mountains of Australia
Two teenagers were raised to safety after they were stuck in the night on the Blue Mountains of the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man went to Govetts Leop on Sunday after Wednesday to Blackheath.
The family were concerned about young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8:00.
The search team composed of local police and aiders was sent to search for young people, and the twin was found around 23:00 at Bridal Veil.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with the couple, and they were raised to security on Monday morning.
They were taken to the Blue Mountains hospital at an ambulance, and their state was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk Airport
The troops of Ukraine have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, soldiers were given a retreat order.
According to Ukraine, the parachute forces have been steeply combined with Russian tanks on the field.
According to the Army's representative, the counterpart's fire has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to have Russian professional soldiers.
Over the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Asovanmer, the Ukraine patrol ship was drowning in the morning, representing Southeast Ukraine, says the border guard.
Eight marine soldiers have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard had no assurance of where the ship was shot.
The Separatists told me yesterday in social media they shot the ship.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov demanded that Ukraine’s troops immediately withdraw into positions, from which they cannot fire civilians.
The Foreign Minister said that in the negotiations of Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE, an immediate ceasefire should be made without conditions.
Lavrov also recalled that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions on our partners’ activities, Lavrov threatened.
The rainfalls made Malmo and Copenhagen flood
The streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday, when the harsh roads smuggled South Sweden and Denmark.
The flood waters cut a number of roads, mixed traffic and buried cars.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that the flood may last even if the rains were predicted to stop by Monday.
Hard rains were able to surprise the Swedish authorities, and the rains were not given premature weather warning.
Ari Mustala, a modern meteorologist of the Finnish Air Science Institute, estimates that the rainbow of the area was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and permanent.
No wonder it was difficult to predict.
The French Socialists should “be quiet and help France,” Francois Hollande’s main supporters said.
Valls urged a deeply divided left to "exhibit their emotions" against a socialist presidency with difficulties, which was not approved by the French majority by the composition of the new government.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
“Our mission is to stay with him,” Valls said and deserved applause.
As a satisfying gesture, the Prime Minister demanded the government to leave the French 35-hour working week, despite the new economic minister Emmanuel Macron's earlier this week's debate on the proposal that the rule should be wasted.
On Saturday, Hollande asked socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira gave rise to diverging opinions on the meeting of socialists and criticizing the Socialist Party that it would allow "France to give up hope in relation to the future".
Marine Le Pen, head of the National Front of the Supreme Rights, spooked the constant division of socialists and said that Valls would not believe that the new government would last a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but also Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous was not even lasting for the summer.
“No new government lasts until autumn or winter,” Le Pen said to journalists.
He reiterated his party's proposal for a disruption of the Parliament and firmly held his party's electoral victory in premature elections and would be ready to lead the party.
The French dominant party suffered a crushing disaster in the March municipalities, and the extremist right held a listing in the May EU elections.
According to the opinion survey of the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party may break down to several competing groups before the end of the Dutch period in 2017.
Political researcher Pascal Perrineau of the University of Po warned that the French will soon lose their patience unless the new Socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and recording unemployment.
“There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that the change is happening,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation can get worse.
Pokka betrayed the morning of the Finnish contenders Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola, and the meteorologist Pekka Poudan's son was badly deceived in the recording part of the program.
Morning Finland’s program released a fun video of Thursday’s recordings on Facebook last Thursday.
The video runners Kirsi Al-Siira and Nina Rahkola, as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta, are trying to record the morning of the posting of the Finnish advertising buffet next day, but the recording is not exactly going to the tube.
Alm-Siira insists in his words when he tries to say a word of budget, and his confusion will also make Pouda and Rahkola lose his tail once afterwards.
And these heroes should be allowed to carry a direct shipment tomorrow, Morning in the Facebook update of Finland.
Video has become very popular on Facebook and is both loved and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
In 1972, Jorma K. Pouta, 68, was the third in the pottery series.
The picture is the Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir.
At the Helsinki Fredrikinkadu, a Socialist International Meeting was held in May 1971.
There were many Heads of State at the meeting and security was huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had a lot of five minutes to photograph.
I took this picture in four metres.
The light and the background were correct.
I realized that this time I succeeded.
The look of the sea sees that the leaders in the Middle East have been difficult before.
Then, in the competition, he was able to do well-known people or events with pictures taken.
It is great that today you can also succeed with other images, as long as you have an idea and visual torque.
This is the second best picture I've taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's crash picture of the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Reason: More than EUR 5 million has already been paid by the Aarnio investigation
The study of the legality of the action of the Helsinki Police Department of Drugs has already cost more than five million euros and has demanded 30-50 years of work.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki Jyväskylä is evaluated in the dissertation of information technology to the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki proposes that the enforcement of the lawfulness of police activities and the fight against crime could be significantly enhanced by combining the IT systems for investigation and judicial treatment.
According to the boundaries, modern technology enables multiple use of criminal technical material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system where information collected to investigate the crime is automatically an electronic evidence that meets the evidence chain, while allowing comprehensive legal supervision.
The claim will be reviewed on Saturday.
Yle: The idea of vegetarian food in 1999 was forgotten on the school wall: "Casvisdiet belongs to fish and chicken foods"
A picture of the special information on the wall of the school of women’s trip caused food in social media, says Yle on their website.
Vegetarians!
Cattle and chicken foods are included in school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list, we prepare a vegetarian option!
This is what is said in a 15-year-old newsletter for the school wall.
You can see the picture from here.
The picture spread in social media has made people send a slight feedback to Pirkkala’s municipality.
The head of the food and cleaning service Arja Vaarma says to Yle that the unforgettable note on the wall is not correct and should have been removed a while ago.
Apparently, before my arrival, there has been a thought that has been discussed with health care.
Every student receives a meal according to his wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian option only with parental permission and a certificate from a doctor or nurse from a vegetarian diet.
The danger justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that young children’s vegetarian experiments may leave their diet short and the lack of meat or chicken can trigger a miracle from the parents of students.
Norwegian Cruise near $3 billion Prestige Cruise
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the world’s third largest cruise company, will negotiate to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. $3 billion. The information is from those who are closely involved.
With the trade, the Norwegian Cruise company with a market value of $6.8 billion would be able to use the Prestige Cruises luxury investors and wealthy customers while continuing to compete against the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) companies.
According to sources, information on the possible agreement may be published this week, although it is also possible that negotiations do not produce results.
The owner of the Prestige Cruises, the private capital investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of the Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be public, because negotiations are not held in public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, and Apollo’s representative refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company from Miami has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013 with turnover of $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates so far from Miami, seams Oceania and Regent brand names, including eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, its turnover was 1.2 billion dollars, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
A $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise in emerging economies in the coming years, such as China and India.
Companies compete to become the first option of these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registers its first shares in the U.S. stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the shares of the company after the 2007 trade with a value of $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in its current composition in 2000 after its association with the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL). The latter is the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay entertainment and casino company.
Apollo invested billion dollars in the Norwegian Cruise company in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published information, Genting accounted for 28% of the company, Apollo 20% and TPG Capital LP 8% from the end of June.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise is 82% of the North American cruise capacity, reflects the registration document published by Prestige Cruise in the context of the invoice.
The Tampere City Government is discussing this today.
Animals wish the city government to firmly support the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, the CEO of Animalia, who prepares a dissertation book for the University of Tampere during the delfinaries in Finland and around the world, it is necessary to end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a generalised view that the preservation of advanced mammals such as delfinaries is not animal-protected or ethically sustainable.
This view would also be expected to take place in Tampere.
The termination of Delfinarium is not only a matter of animal law, but also a question of Tampere’s immago as a tourist destination, the judge would point out.
According to the prosecution risk, the death of Näsi-delphine confirms the requirements of the delfinarium activity.
Death is a sad follow-up to the dark history of the Sarkännieme delfinarium.
It is time to put a point on deaths, to close the delfine prison and to find out how the Tampere delfines could be transferred to a limited sea area, to a kind of delfine shelter, the judge requires.
The vision was not able to experience the return to the original living environment of delfines, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Sarkanniem were able to experience even more life than the inviolable concrete, the judge hopes.
The purpose of Animalia is to prohibit the use of all species of wildlife in circus in the overall reform of the animal protection legislation under preparation.
This group also reads the delfinaries.
In support of the requirement, the Executive Director of Animalia, the Court of Justice, today, participates in the 1.9th demonstration of the dolphins.
The demonstration of the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a position against the delfine hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2300 delfines are cruelly arrested or killed annually for the use of delfinaries or food.
Putin demands Kiev to open negotiations on the new state with Eastern Ukraine
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Ukraine Government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiating the "state" of the region, the Russian news sources say.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the eastern Ukraine region controlled by the Separatists would be part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the people of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their own rights and interests.
The demand for negotiations with Russian rebels to the Government of Putin Kiova as equal negotiators corresponds to his obvious strategy since the violence began five years ago: he aims to help separatists take over the region and thus forces the Ukraine Government in practice to grant independence to the newly declared Novorossier, which allows it to go to Russia instead of the West.
In the State Channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to conquer the separatists ruled by the Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which the separatists took over in March and April after Moscow joined the Ukraine Crimean Peninsula themselves on March 18.
Kreml and separatists have recently embraced the area as "Novorossija", "New Russia" – this term reminds us of the glorious days of the pre-Russian Revolutions.
According to Itar-Tass, the Russian news agency, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations are "illusion" as long as Ukraine's politicians carry out campaigns for the parliamentary elections held on 26 October and the government's troops attack civilians in separatists.
“We need to start immediately broad negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the Southeast Ukraine state, taking into account the interests of people living there,” he said.
According to Peskov, Putin’s reference to "stativity" relates to broader independence, which has been discussed with Kiev’s leadership for months in attempting to dismantle the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only Ukraine's government can grant eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "as this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine".
The mid-notice of the Kremlin representative, which was designed to correct Putin's comments as a "fail interpretation", stressed that the Russian government deals with the separatist revolt of the eastern regions in a different way than in Crimea, where it, in practice, ruled the area, which the majority of the population of 2 million are ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to connect the regions of Donetsk or Luhansk even in Eastern Ukraine, because most of the people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because, according to the pre-conflict opinion surveys, the majority of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
Independence on which Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would allow the local governments of Ukraine to agree themselves with their own trade agreements and external relations, which would in practice give Kremlin a view of the territory of power that connects with the Russian Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was attached to Russia five months ago, is located in the Russian main fleet, as well as in the port areas of commercial sea and historical coastal destinations.
There are also mines, factories and metal soils in the area between Russia and Crimea that produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of the regions departing from the nuclear area of Ukraine on their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to be steeply different from the view of the separatists that may be armed and enslaved by Kremlin and Moscow.
Putinin made his latest demand to the Kiova Government for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels progressed more than last week after the Russian tanks and troops invaded East Ukraine from the previously peaceful region of the Azov Sea coast.
Ukraine’s security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovsk of the separatists supported by Russia is the beginning of a greater effort to conquer the entire strategically important coastal area of Crimea.
It has led to a massive civilian and military staff to strengthen the city of Mariupol, and half a million inhabitants of Mariupol are known as a steel-producing port city located between Novoazovsk and the narrow land of the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union asking for further measures to prevent future violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Republic of the Soviet Union, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We'll soon get a point from which there's no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not make decisions on direct action; the leaders presented additional sanctions in order to enable them to be introduced if the Ukraine crisis is re-introduced in uncertain circumstances.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to retreat their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armor departments and 1,000 soldiers moved to Donetsk last week to strengthen the separatists in trouble, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, told journalists in Kiova on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first Ukrainian 63 soldiers in Ilovaisk were replaced by 10 Russian parachute hypnotes that were arrested in Ukraine a week ago.
Milan’s opening paint was made by the Japanese driller Keisuke Honda with the seventh game minute.
In the second half, Sulley Muntar was first hit by Jeremy Menez.
Laziok got a ranch at the end of the game after his mining paint, but the goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this period from Real Madrid.
In the Inzagh training debyy of Milan's former attacker, the San Siron stadium was only halfway away.
There were 39,000 audiences.
Australian publics and Gabi Grecco naked scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is naked by hackers, perhaps by stealing his engagement and Hollywood A-list Gabi Grecko naked images.
In the entertainment world, a bunch of naked images of Jennifer Lawrence were published on the Internet as a result of a wide range of celebrity search scandals.
Hakker has a total of 60 naked pictures of stars of hunger game Lawrence and other superstars, such as Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The pictures of the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Melbourne are apparently stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Grecko, who asked Edelsten last month, said to the Confidential magazine, "this is disgusting."
All personal communications and images should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and distributed.
Greckon in New York is reported by commenting on the case in the web magazine as "ashamed" and said that the victims "could feel ashamed."
Hacker has 30 photos of Palmer with this last boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two samples from Palmer on the topless pool.
Palmer’s movies include the film "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck's star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actress Browning did not comment on hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence’s representative said to the TMZ magazine that “the problem is a ruthless breach of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen hated the hacker in his twitter: “The publication of stolen images does not differ in any way from the sale of a stolen product.”
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, only from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost as a homefield and went to a sensational victory from Cuba at the MMs of the aircraft ball.
Look at the pictures of the fan humidity.
The Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not the Polish red white but the Finnish blue white.
According to the STT, Finland’s victory was followed by nearly 2000 Finnish stockholders.
It felt like he was playing at home.
The fans had such a big impact on our game, and the Finnish captain Antti Siltala told the STT.
Finland had already lost 0-2 in the match, but went to win in column 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle behind six points.
Cuba has already run 16-10, but afterwards the Finns got the charm.
However, Parisata Finn fans had to be disappointed when a charter machine could not land on the field because of the hard fog of Katowice.
So the fans who ended in Warsaw were late for the match.
The Finnish football fans have conquered Europe in the last few days.
In the Spanish Bilbao basketball MM competitions, Finland fans are more than 8000.
As if every Finnish basket had been a winning basket, Stephen Curry, the American star player, praised Finnish basketball fans after the Saturday game.
The Council meeting shall not be sent directly because of technical problems
The meeting of the Kouvola City Council cannot be seen today via the internet as a direct broadcast.
According to the city’s newsletter, the shipment is not possible due to technical problems.
The town of Kouvola regrets the situation.
