“I’m fortunately fine, but it was creepy to see how people tried to break out the windows so they could get out.
People hit the glass with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
“One window glass is finally broken, so they began to escape through the window,” said the survivor Franciszek Kowal.
The stars release light and heat while hydrogen atoms combine (or fusion) together and thus create more difficult chemical elements.
Scientists work on a reactor that could produce energy the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve, and it can take years before using fusion reactors are built.
Due to the surface tension, the steel needle floats on the top of the water.
Surface tension is created because water molecules on the surface of the water are more attractive than air molecules above them attract them.
Water molecules form an invisible skin on the surface of the water, allowing objects such as needles to float on the top of the water.
Among the two edges of the modern snake, there is a homogeneous hole. The two edges allow better ice storage, even in a decision-making position.
Since the blade is slightly curved, as the blade is tilted on one side or the other side, the edge that touches the ice also bows.
This causes the rotation of the squirrel. If the squirrels fall right, the squirrel turns right, and the squirrels fall left, then the squirrel turns left.
"Extreme Energy" not more than energy."
This is achieved by the release of the light particle called the photon.
"Scientists call this process "stimulated radiation emissions" because the atoms are stimulated by strong light, which causes light photon emissions, and light is a kind of radiation."
The photo below presents atoms that release photos. In reality, photographers are much smaller than they can see in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than nuclear materials.
After hundreds of hours of operation, the electric electric fiber will eventually burn out and the electric circuit will not work.
Then the bulb should be replaced. We should be careful when changing the bulb.
First, the electric switch should be turned off or the cable should be pulled off.
This is because the current flow in the container at the bulking metal part can cause you a serious flux if you touch the inside of the booking or the lower part of the bulking metal while it is still partly in the container.
The main organ of the circulating system is the heart that pumps blood.
The blood is flown from the heart in the blood arteries, and returned in the tubes called veins. The smallest eres are called hair fibers.
The teeth of Triceratops were not only able to bite the leaves, but also the very hard branches and roots.
According to some scientists, Triceratops was eating cyclic palm, which was a widely spread plant in the creat.
These plants are similar to small palm trees, sharp and punctured limb corona.
The triceratops could have used their strong boobs to take the leaves before you consume the tribe.
Other scientists argued that these plants are extremely poisonous, so it is unlikely that dinosaurs consumed them, despite the fact that toxic leaves or fruits are consumed today.
How would Io's gravity affect me? If you were on the surface of Io, you'd be pushing less than on Earth.
The man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would be 36 pounds (16 kg) weight. So, gravity, of course, less affects you.
The sun does not have a curtain for which, like on Earth, can be placed on it. The sun is formed by gases, fire and plasma.
Gas becomes more thin as we get away from the center of the sun.
In view of the sun, the external part of it is called photosphere, meaning “light globe”.
Approximately three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei observed that Venus had a phase similar to the Moon.
Phases are developed because only the side of Venus (or the Moon) lights toward the Sun. The phases of Venus supported the theory of Copernicus that planets circulate around the sun.
Then a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks watched one of the retreats of Venus.
After Danelaw's retirement, England had a long period of peace.
In 991, Ethelred faced such a viking fleet, which was bigger than Guthrum met a hundred years earlier.

The voiceeul originally called the Hunmin Jeongeum, which means “the right voices for the order of men.”
There are a number of theories about the creation of the Sanskrit language. One of the theories about migration from the West to India, according to which their members brought this language with them.
Sanskrit is one of the ancient languages, many are compared to the Latin language in Europe.
The world’s first known book was written in Sanskrit, but after the upanissaries were compiled, the Sanskri became meaningless because of hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that is based on many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the basis of European languages, such as French or Spanish.
After the battle against France, Germany began to prepare for the attack on the British island.
Germany has given the code name of the attack of the "Oroslanfoka Operation", and most of the hardarms and equipment of the British Army were lost when they evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.
However, the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any obsessive sea soldiers crossing the La Manche Canal.
At the same time, only very few ships of the Royal Navy stayed near the likely route of attack, as the Navy feared that they would fall due to German air attacks.
“Let’s explain Italy’s plans. Italy was primarily German and Japanese’s little brother.”
He had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although four new ships were built before the war began.
Italy’s main goal was African countries. In order to take these countries, its teams would need a starting base to get through the Mediterranean Sea and flood Africa.
Therefore, they had to get rid of British bases and ships staying in Egypt. In addition to these actions, Italian warships had no other task.
As regards Japan, Japan is an island country, as is Britain.
Submarine ships are designed for underwater transport and long-term underwater stay.
They used submarines in World War I and World War II. At that time they were very slow, and their range of shooting was very limited.
At the beginning of the war, the submarines typically travelled on the surface of the sea, but as the radar discovery became increasingly advanced and more accurate, they were forced to fall underwater, not to notice them.
German submarines were simply called U-Boats. The Germans acquired extraordinary expertise in the navigation and operation of submarines.
Due to their success with submarines after the war, the Germans were not allowed to hold much of them.
Yes, Tutanhamon, who is sometimes referred to as “the King of Tut” or “the King of God,” is currently one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings.
In a surprising way, he was not considered to be such a significant personality in the ancient era and was not included in the list of most ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his grave made him famous in 1922. While many of the graves were robbed in the past, this grave was virtually left intact.
Most of the objects that were buried together with Tutanhamon remained in good condition, including thousands of artifacts made of noble metal and rare stones.
With the invention of a large wheel, Assyrian fighters became easier, faster and better, and easier to sweep soldiers and other fighters.
The arrows of their deadly numbers were able to influence the armor of the rival soldiers. After Christ, about 1,000 were introduced by the Assyrians first.
The horsemanship is a army that fights on horseback. The rain has not yet been invented, so he sat on the hair of the Assyrian rider during the fight.
We know a number of ancient politicians, scientists and artists. One of the most well-known figures of culture, Homéros, the legendary blind poets who created two masterpieces of the ancient Greek literature, Ilias and Odysseia.
Sophoklész and Arisztotelész are still popular drama writers, and their plays are considered to be the most important pieces of the world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematical Pitagoras, most known for the relationship between the sides of the curved triangle.
There are different estimates of how many people in the world speak Hindi language. It is estimated that this is the second-quarters of the most common language spoken in the world.
The number of speakers depends on whether they count very similar dialektuss.
The number of speakers is estimated to be between 340 and 500 million, and about 800 million of those who understand.
The vocabulary of Hindi and Urdu are similar, but their style of writing is different. During the daily conversation, the speakers of the two languages generally understand each other.
In the 15th century, Germany had a great impact on the culture of Northern Estonia.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the natives, so they invented the literal Estonian language.
It was based on German alphabet, and it was added by a letter “O/O”.
By the end of the time, many words from Germany were united. This was the beginning of the enlightenment.
The throne ruler calls to traditions directly after the school has finished.
Charles went to Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology and later learned history, gaining 2:2 qualifications (this is a lower secondary degree).
Cardinal was the first member of the British royal family who received a degree.
In Turkey, 3% of the territory of the country is located in the European part of Turkey (Estonia or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula).
Turkey is more than 1600 km (1,000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, and its shape is largely similar to a brickboard.
Turkey's area, including lakes, is 783 562 square kilometres (300 948 square meters), of which 755 688 square kilometres (291 773 square meters) are in southwest Asia and 23 764 square kilometres (9174 square meters) in Europe.
Turkey is the 37st largest country in the world, which is approximately equivalent to the metropolitan area of France and the United Kingdom.
Turkey is bordered by three sides of the sea: west of the Aegean Sea, north of the Black Sea, south of the Mediterranean Sea.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence begins in 1839.
Some of the current parts of Belgium were part of Luxembourg in the past, but since the Belgian Revolution of 1830 became a Belgian region.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but Germany was obsessed with both the I. and II. World War.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization we are currently known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruinous fortress and buddhist monastery in the top part of the town of Paro (Phondey village).
It is believed that the fortress was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel in 1649 in the memory of the victory against the Tibet-mongol force.
As a result of a 1951 firefall, only few Drukgyal Dzong relics were left, such as Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was preserved and protected, so one of Bhutan’s most sensible attractions remained.
During the 18th century, Cambodia found herself among two strong neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century, the Thais obsessed Cambodia several times and destroyed Phnom Phen in 1772.
In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnameses also obsessed Cambodia.
Eighty percent of Venezuelas are unemployed, and most of the employed are looking for bread in the black economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans work in the service industry, almost one-quarters in the industrial sector, and one-fifth in the agriculture sector.
One of the important industries of Venezuelas is oil, where the country is a net exporter, even if only one percent of them work in the oil industry.

Learning to create interactive media requires generally accepted and traditional skills, as well as the use of devices described in interactive hours (competitive scenario, sound and image editing, history, etc.).
Interactive design presupposes the re-evaluation of media production assumptions and the acquisition of non-linear thinking.
To interactive design, it is necessary to connect the components of a project to each other, while also to stand as an independent entity.
The disadvantage of zoom objects is that the complexity of the focus and the number of lenses needed to achieve the focus distance is much higher than the fixed-speed objects.
This is becoming an increasingly meaningless problem, as lens manufacturers are getting more and more results in lens production.
This made it possible to access lenses to create high-quality images that can be achieved with fixed focus lenses.
One of the other disadvantages of zoom objects is that the maximum opening of objects is generally low.
Therefore, cheap zoom objects are difficult to use in addition to weak light conditions without blindness.
One of the most common problems in converting movies to DVD format is overpaging.
Most televisions are designed to meet the needs of the general population.
So everything you see on the TV has been cut down the edges below, above and on the side.
This means that the picture covers the entire screen.
Unfortunately, when we make a DVD, the winds are likely to be cut down and if the video is too close to the bottom edge, it will not appear completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long encouraged imagination, parallels, holidays, and Arthur’s early ridicule.
Although we are among the thousands of years of ruins, we can easily recall the voices and smells of the ancient battles, almost hear the pots knocking on the cat stones and smelling the fear of the castle.
But is our imagination based on reality? First of all, why have they built castles? How have they been designed and built?
The characteristic of the era is that Kirby Muxloe Castle is a fortified house rather than a real castle.
His large glass windows and thin walls would not have been able to resist a determined attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings started building, the country was relatively peaceful, and only a courier was needed to protect against the robbers.
The system of balanced forces was a system in which the European nations sought to preserve national sovereignty in all European countries.
The concept was that all European nations had to prevent a certain nation from becoming strong power, and that is why national governments often changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The Spanish Heritage War was the first war, the center of which was the balance of power.
This was an important milestone, since European powers have no longer fought on a religious basis, so the War of the Thirty Year is the last religious-based war.
The church of Artemis was destroyed in Ephesus on July 21, 356, due to the fire of Herostratus.
According to the story, the purpose was to make a reputation at any price. The disgusted Ephesians banned the mention of the name of Herostry.
The Greek historian, Strabo, later recorded the name, and so we learned about it. The church was destroyed on the same night when the Great Sándor was born.
As King Sándor, he offered to pay for the reconstruction of the temple, but it was rejected. Later, after his death, in 323 B.C.E., the church was rebuilt.

Mysticism is the desire to unite with the ultimate reality, deity, spiritual truth, or with God, or his conscious perception.
The believer wants direct experience, intuition or insight into divine reality, deity, or gods.
Followers pursue unique lifestyles or follow practices designed to harness these experiences.

Scikism is the religion of the Indian subcontinent. It comes from the 15th century Pandab region, from the deduction of one of the sects within the Hindu tradition.
The rocks believe as a religion separated from Hinduism, although their roots and traditions are recognized.
"The Rocks religion is called Gurmat, which means "the way of guru" in the Pandab language. All Indian religions of guru are fundamentally important, but within the sparkism."
The religion was founded by Guru Nanak (1469-1539) in the 15th century, followed by nine more gurus.

The Indus Valley civilization was a bronze civilization in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, which included most of today’s Pakistan and some of India’s northwestern regions and the northwestern part of Afghanistan.
The civilization flourished in the Indus River pools, where its name comes from.
While some scientists think that civilization existed in the area of the already dehydrated Sarasvati river, it should be called Indus-Sarasvati civilization, while others would be called the first mining area of Harappa, which was discovered in the 1920s.
The militarist of the Roman Empire has helped the development of medical science.
The doctors began to apply Emperor Augustus, and even he was the one who created the first Roman medical body to treat the aftermath of the battles.
The surgeons have known a variety of tranquilizers, including morphine from the Magic Extract and scocolamine from the seeds of the intestines.
In amputation, they gained experience in protecting patients from suppression, towers and arterial obstructions in order to promote blood flow.
The Roman Empire has achieved significant results in the field of medical science over the centuries and has developed a large part of our current knowledge.
The pureland origami is an origami where the restriction is valid, according to which only one drive can be carried out at the same time, the more complex stretchs such as the recovery are not allowed and all drives have a clear place.
John Smith developed in the 1970s to help people with unexperienced drivers or limited motor skills.
In children, awareness of different species and species stereotypes develops at a relatively young age, and these racial stereotypes influence their behavior.
For example, children who are identical to a race minority associated with stereotypes that do not perform well at school when they know the stereotype of their minority, are inclined to perform well at school.
MySpace is the third most popular website of the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have been given great attention, especially in the field of education.
These websites also have positive aspects, such as the easy to create class sites with their help, including blogs, videos, photos and other functions.
The site is easy to access, only a web address should be given, which makes it easier for students who have trouble spelling or using the keyboard.
It is customized to be easily readable with as many colors as we want.
"The lack of attention is "a neurological syndrome with a classicly defining symptom of impulsion, restlessness and hyperactivity or excessive energy levels."
This is not a learning disorder, it is a learning disorder; “it affects 3-5 percent of children, almost 2 million children in America.”
Children in ADD are difficult to focus on things such as school work, but they are able to listen to fun things, such as playing, watching favorite cartoons, or writing words without centering.
These children often get into trouble because to stimulate their brains, they “behave risky, fight and rebel against authority” because their brains cannot be stimulated with normal methods.
ADHD affects relationships with its partners because other children do not understand why they are acting in a given way or why their maturity levels are different.
Since the ability to gain knowledge and learning has changed as described above, the speed of knowledge has also changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. The focus was no longer on recalling individual memories, but on the ability to respond to the text.
Overall, renaissance has made significant changes in the approach to learning and dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other mammals, man-mammals no longer use their hands in the process of changing the place, carrying the load or between the trees.
The hand and leg of the chimpanzee is similar to size and length, reflecting the load function of the hand during the walk on the wrist.
The human hand is shorter than the leg, with even more fingers.
Fossil bones between two and three million years reveal changes in the specialization of the hand from the movement to manipulation.
Some people believe that conscious dreaming often artificially induced may be extremely burdensome.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of the extension of pure dreams between REM conditions.
Because of the rhythm of the REM cycle every night (which is the condition when we actually sleep and our body is regenerating) may become increasingly a problem.
It's just as exhausting as you wake up TV every twenty or thirty minutes.
The effect depends on how many times the brain attempts to consciously dream each night.
From the beginning, things were almost wrong for the Italians in North Africa. Within a week of the Italian war message of 10 June 1940, the United Kingdom took over fort Capuzzo in Libya.
During the attack east of Bardia, the British arrested the main engineer of the tenth Italian army, General Lastucci.
On June 28, during his landing in Tobruk, a friendly fire killed Marshal Italbo Balbo, Libyan governor and Mussolini's legal heir.
Modern sports are carried out at many levels, from students studying at the university to professional and Olympic competitions.
Sport is played mainly in the form of two fighters.
Golf is a game in which players try to hit the ball with bats in different holes.
In a standard round, they play 18 holes, where players usually start at the first hole and finish at the eighteenth.
The player wins the least by hitting or pushing the track.
The sport is in the grass. The grass around the hole is cut shorter and it is called green.
The most common type of tourism is most people associated with travel: leisure tourism.
For example, when people go to a place different from their usual everyday lifestyles to relax and have fun there.
Beaches, entertainment parks and tents are the places that leisure tourists visit mostly.
If the purpose of visiting a particular place is to learn about its history and culture, this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit the different attractions of a particular country or decide to focus on a single area.
In view of this activity, colonists also requested reinforcement.
Among the foreseeable positions of the teams, Colonel John Stark and Colonel James Reed were led by 200 people 1 and 2 of the New Hampshire (they were later both generals).
Stark's men took their positions along the fence north of the colonists.
When the low waterfall opened a gap along the Mystic River in the northeast part of the peninsula, a short stone wall quickly extended the fence to the north to end the wind of the water, on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a curtain from the fence to about 100 feet (30 meters) and commanded no one to fire until the soldier was gone.
The American plan was based on a coordinated attack in three different directions.
General John Cadwalder is launching a distraction attack against the British Police in Bordentown to block the path of any reinforcements.
General James Ewing would cross the river with 700 civilians at Trenton Ferry, occupied the bridge over Assunpink Creek, preventing the escaping of enemy troops.
The main attack force of 2400 people would pass through the river, from Trenton to nine miles from it will be divided into two groups: one of Greene, the other Sullivan, under the control of the attack before dawn.
When you run, if someone has become half-measured from a quarter to a half-measured distance, then the speed will become less important, but the endurance will be absolutely necessary.
Of course, a first-class, half-scale, man running in two minutes must have a corresponding speed, but the durability must be improved anyway.
The best preparation for the running season is a small terrain running in winter and the torn of the upper body.
The right nutrition itself does not assume outstanding performance, but can significantly affect the overall well-being of young athletes.
The understanding of the various aspects of healthy energy economy, effective hydrating practices and supplementary diet can contribute to improving the performance of athletes and improving the enjoyment of sports.
The mid-distance is a relatively cheap sport, but there is a couple of mistakes about some of the parts of the equipment needed for gymnastics.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most of them have no small or no real impact on performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even if it does not provide real benefits.
The nuclear is considered to be one of the essential elements that make all the materials.
This is a very complex unit that consists of a central cell seed and its surrounding electrons in accordance with the simplified Bohr model, similar to the way planets circulate around the Sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nuclear seed consists of two types of elementary particles: protons and neutrons.
Protons have a positive electric charge, while neutrons have no charge. Electrons are negative electric charger.
Before examining the victim, you should first measure the location in order to ensure your safety.
When approaching, you must observe the situation of the victim and any warning signal.
If you're hurt when you're trying to help, you're just getting worse.
The study found that depression, fear and bruises have been involved in the relationship between pain and disability in patients with dermal pain.
Weekly regular, systematic exercises have only affected the effects of increased pain, not depression and fear.
Participants in regular activities needed more support for the negative understanding of pain to discriminate chronic pain from the discomfort of normal physical movement.
Sensitivity or visibility depends on visual system sensors or eyes.
There are several types of structured eyes, depending on the complexity of the body’s needs.
The different structures are equipped with different capabilities, sensitive to different wavelengths and sharpness, increasing their input sensation requires a different processing mode and their number is different for optimal operation.
A collection of organisms of a particular species in a specific geographical area.
If a certain phenotype characteristic of all members of a population is identical, we call them monomorphs.
It is called polymorphs when individuals show more versions of a specific feature.
The colonies of the migratory sound are stretched and nested at different stages.
At the nomadic stage, the soldiers are going to take a ride at night and beat a camp day.
The colony enters a nomadic phase when the amount of food available drops. In this section, the colony makes temporary nests that are replaced every day.
Each of these nomadic storms and trips lasts for about 17 days.
"What's the cell? The cell word comes from the Latin ""cella" word, which means "small room", and the first one was introduced by a laboratory investigating the structure of the paraffin."
The cell is the basic unit of living things, and every body consists of one or more cells.
The cells are extremely fundamental and important in the study of life, many refer to them as “builders of life.”
The nervous system maintains homeostasis to disperse neurological impulses in the body, ensuring an uninterrupted, continuous circulation of blood.

The MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
At this resonance level, the magnetic field and radio waves make the atoms emit small radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian’s doctor and researcher discovered the basis for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later a patent was issued, which is the world’s first patent in the area of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first “good body” MRI device called “Retardless”.

Lavina is not an abnormality; steep downs can only hold a certain amount of snow, and the excess amount shrinks from them as lavina.
The problem is that the snow is taping, so you need a certain intervention to start, while the start of snow can also start the rest.
