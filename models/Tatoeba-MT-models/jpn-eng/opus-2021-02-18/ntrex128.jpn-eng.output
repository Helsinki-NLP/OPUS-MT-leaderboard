Congressmen who fear shame (AM)
The proposal to change the name of the Welsh Parliament from Assemble Meber to MWP (Member of the World) has caused confusion among some of them.
It started with a plan to change the name of the Wales Parliament.
MPs of all parties are concerned that this could lead to a ridiculous situation.
One worker party member said that he fears that the party will sing "Twp" and "Pwp".
For readers other than the Welsh, Twp means "duck" in Wales, and Pwp means "duck."
A member of the Pride Kamari Party said he proposed alternative proposals for the whole party to be "not happy".
A member of the Welsh conservative Party said that the party is “open” to change its name, but that it is not much different from the pronunciation of MWP and "muppet”:
I'm going to give you a couple of examples.
"The final decision on the name of the senator's name, of course, is committed to the senator himself."
In 2017, the Wales Government gave the Wales Parliament the authority to change its name.
In June, the committee released the results of a citizen conference on the proposal, which revealed its strong support for changing the name of the Parliament from Assembully to Welsh Parillament.
In regard to the name of the senator, the committee supported the idea of the Wales Parliament, or WMP, but the MWP's idea has won the most support in the civil council.
The senator is actually suggesting an alternative plan, but the journey to obtain an agreement could be a headache for President Erin Jones, who is required to submit a bill for a name change within a few weeks.
The bill on the reform also includes other reforms regarding the rules of disbelief in Congress and how Congress will operate, including the structure of the committee system.
In the process of the bill, the MPs will have a final decision as to what to do with their name.
Macedonia has a national vote to change its name
A vote will be held on Sunday to ask if the country's name will be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The poll was organized to resolve decades of controversy with neighboring Greece, which has a region called Macedonia in the country.
Greece has long argued that the names of neighboring countries in the north deserve to claim ownership of Greek territory and has strongly opposed Macedonia’s participation in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Jorge Ivanov, who is against a national election change of name, said he is going to ignore the results of the vote:
However, supporters of the popular vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The Church of St. Martin is silent, while the church in the Salem is struggling.
"When I talk to an old man, I hear that there was always a bar and a church in the past," Adam says.
None of them exist right now.
I can't understand why the bar disappeared.
"We're communicating in another way."
"The bar is no longer a neighbor's living room."
As for the church, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the authorities expect, and will soon be back on track.
In addition, churches are replaced by apartments and apartments, where he says those who live will not cooperate in maintaining them.
"I think the majority of the people who live in this building will be white," he says, "and this hastens the closing of the church, because most of them will not be in the church."
The church was built by a white congregation, and the city of Herm became a black city in 1870.
The original white mesisist congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation that was praying nearby owned the building.
St. Martin was inherited by the Black Congregation under John Howard Johnson, who led boycotting of 125 retailers on the main street of Harem, where he hired and supported the black.
The church was badly damaged by the fire in 1939, but Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it and asked Kalion.
Reverend John Howard Johnson and the successor of John Johnson named Carrie in St. Martin "Bel the Poor Man."
In July, the musicians who came to Carion's performance called the "Charion's Treasure" and "The Unique Historical Musical Music."
According to the University of Michigan, this is the first carion performed by black musician Dionysio D. Lindo in the world.
Mr. Merywether said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
In the past few months, St. Martin’s is a complicated story of builders, some of which were brought about by church leaders, and others by the dioceses.
In July, the governing body of the parish pastor sent a letter to the parish expressing concern that the parish was willing to pay for it, but it was not involved in hiring architects and contractors.
Some parishioners complained that the bishop's actions were not clear.
Sharks strike a 13-year-old who's diving in lobster, California.
On Saturday, authorities reported that a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy swimming in lobster, California, on the day the lobster season began.
Just before 7:00 a.m. on Encinitas Beacon Beach.
According to KSWB-TV, Chad Hamel had spent an hour and a half bathing with friends in San Diego on Saturday morning when he heard a boy ask for help and then pulled up.
Hamel thought he was just too excited to take a lobster, but as soon as he saw it, he said, "I've been bit!"
You bit me!
Hale noticed when he rescued the boy.
"They all cried out to get out of the sea, and there were sharks!" Hale says.
The boy was flown to the Lady Childress Hospital in San Diego and is in danger.
We still don't know the type of shark that attacked them.
Lifeguard captain Larry Jaracz said in an interview that several weeks ago it was confirmed that the shark was not a dangerous species.
In addition, there are very serious traumas at the top of the boy's body.
To investigate and ensure safety, authorities have sealed off from Pont Beach in Casa Blood to the Esinitas Swami Beach for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury's plan has made a big move towards the beauty market in England.
Seinsbury has adopted Bouots, Superdrugs, and Devenhams into the beauty corridors of the staff's department store.
In an effort to make big progress in the growing market for 2.2 billion pounds of beauty while fashion and household goods are on the decline, a larger beauty corridor will be tested in 11 beauty stores throughout the country, and next year's production will be expanded.
The investment in beauty was born with no idea of how to use all the shelves when the supermarkets are sued by TV, microwaves, and household products.
According to Seinsbury, the number of beauty products is twice as high as 3,000, including the first brand of Levlon, Essie, Tweezerman, Dr. PawPaw.
So, we're going to have a lot more space for existing products such as L'Orial, Maybelline, Burns' Bess.
The store has re-aligned the bacti zone to support the youth's wishes and focus most of its products on Vigan.
In addition, the perfumer’s Flagress Shop gives up their share to two Seymoursbury shops, one last week, the Klon of Southern London, and the other later this year, to the Seyming Oaks of Armingham.
The trend of online shopping and small amounts of food in rural convenience stores has led to the need for the supermarkets to be skillful in inviting customers.
According to Seinsbury's CEO, Mike Koupe, as supermarket chains provide more services and reduce food and fight against Aldi and Lidl on the discount, the stores become more and more department stores.
Seinsbury has expanded its power by introducing Argos' shops to hundreds of stores since two years ago to buy two chains that strengthened the sale of food and boosted the profitability of purchases.
The last supermarket attempt to renew a beauty shop and a pharmacy failed.
The relationship between Seinsbury and Boots in the early 2000s and the distribution of the profits from the pharmacy was broken.
Three years ago, Seinsbury sold a pharmacy at 281 stores, the owner of the Loyds Pharmacy chain, Celesio, a new project came up after selling 15 million pounds.
This also involved Loyds, who introduced skin care brands like La Roche-Passay and Vichy in four stores.
"I'm changing the appearance and feel of the beauty passage to change the environment of my clients," says Seinsbury's commercial director, Paul Mill Hicks.
I'm investing in a special training colleague who's going to give me advice.
Our brand responds to all our needs and shows us a new beauty business in an attractive environment and a convenient location.
And Peter's anger was the result of Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the deal of £11 million.
The star of the Dragons Den, Peter Jones, was furious that she withdrew from a $11 million deal to Peter's lifestyle brands, focusing on his new contract with Marks, Spencer and ITV by Holly Willoughby.
Willoughby is impossible to spend time with household items and jewelry brands "Truly".
Their business was likened to Gwines Partlow's Grebrand.
This morning, Willowy told me he'd withdraw from his business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has abandoned Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, to focus on the new big deal with Marks, Spencer and ITV by retreating from their advantage of lifestyle branding at the time.
On Thursday, on the Golden Girls' show, when a new contract worth 1.5 million pounds made it clear that it was impossible to spend time with home products and jewelry brands "Truly", Jones said in a tense meeting at the headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The project was compared to the Gobbrand of Gwinnes Pardlow, which doubled Willowy's estimated 11 million assets.
When Willowy reported that he was retreating from Tully on Instagram, Jones ran out of England to one of the cabins.
The source said, "Truly has the highest priority for Holly so far.
It's going to be a long-term thing that's been looking at for decades.
Everyone was amazed at the decision to retreat.
No one can believe what happened on Thursday until it was released.
Marlowe's office is full of goods ready for sale.
According to experts, the departure of Willoughby, the most relied star in Britain, costs millions of dollars to invest in the products of cushions, candles, clothing, and household items and possibly even delay the production.
This means the end of our long friends.
The mother of three, Willowy and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been working closely with Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willowby started Cap and Truly in 2016, and Jones joined as president in March.
They're both on holiday, and Jones has been funding 40 percent of Baldwin's TV producers.
Willowby's going to be an M.S. sign, and instead of Ant McPartlin, he's going to be an I'm A Celebrity.
Jones' sources said last night, "I don't comment about his business."
"I fell in love."
He joked against media criticism of North Korean leaders that he was supposed to be “open”:
Why did President Trump give up?
The president said in a false voice, "The news anchor."
I'm not giving up on anything.
President Kim Jong-un said after his first meeting in Singapore in June, after which he was praised by the president for the great progress toward nuclearization of North Korea, Kim Jong-un was active in his second meeting.
But the non-nuclear negotiations are dead.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's highest diplomat, Kunihito, said to world leaders on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly:
Instead, the United States continued to use sanctions to pressure them.
The card gave a much more optimistic view of Larry's speech.
He's doing well with the North Koreans.
"Previously intended to wage war with North Korea.
Millions of people will die.
Now we're in a great relationship."
The effort to improve relations with North Korea has resulted in a desirable result, says Trump, in the end of the missile experiment, in the release of innocent hostages, and in the conversion of American soldiers' bodies.
And when we talked about our relationship to Kim Jong-un, we used an unusual metaphor.
“It’s easy to be president, but I've called 200 people out there right now rather than calling 10,000 people to fill the room,” Trump said, pointing directly to the people in front of them.
Tsunami and earthquakes hit Indonesia, and hundreds of people died.
The aftermath of the Ronbok earthquake, for example, said that foreign non-governmental organizations are not needed.
Despite being divided by more than 10 percent of the population of Ronbok, there is no national disaster that is needed to call for international aid.
"In many cases, it has been made clear that, unfortunately, we do not demand international aid.
"Save the Children" is preparing for the par, but it is still not clear if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Seat, a spokesman for the National Disasters Organization, said that Indonesian authorities are deciding whether to allow international organizations to help with the situation of the part:
In light of Indonesia's constant earthquake, the country is hopelessly not prepared to face the wrath of nature.
There are tsunami shelters in Ache, but there are not many other coastlines.
The pulsar clearly has fewer tsunami sirens, and with sirens, it can save more lives.
Even if it's the best time, it's a lot of skis to go to Indonesia.
Natural disasters have made the flow more complex.
The rescue ship that stopped at Lomme to pick up the earthquake is leaving for Par, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widdet has funded the roads and railways as the center of the campaign to improve Indonesia's miserable infrastructure.
However, the lack of funds has plagued Joko's regime.
President Joko is under pressure from prolonged religious tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims are more conservative.
More than 1,000 people have died and tens of thousands have been separated from their homes.
Thank you, Daniel Stallridge of Liverpool.
On Saturday, Daniel Stallridge defeated Liverpool in the Premium League in Chelsea, and ran a score of 89 minutes on the Stanford Bridge in London.
Starridge received a pass from Sheldon Shaquiri, which was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal and his team was at least one-zero.
He taps the ball to the left, shoots it into the post.
The ball went up and down the net on the top right.
The ball became the finish line for the leaping Quepa Arizabaraga.
"The players like Shak were as fast as they could, so I was only in my position to take the ball, and I was trying to play myself while there was time."
"When I saw Cante coming, I touched him a little bit, and he didn't think too much, but just shot.
In 25 minutes, Chelsea has taken the point from the Belgian star Eden Hazad, which leads at 1-0.
Bruce Streaker stopped the path of Matteo Kovach in the match, ran around Midfield and headed for Liverpool.
Kovach was a quick gig and goer in Midfield.
There he let loose his beautiful slacks, and he was on his way to the goal.
He broke through the diffield and reached the Farpostnet and hit the shooter across Allison Becker in Liverpool on his left foot.
On Wednesdays, at Stadio San, Naples, Liverpool fought with Naples at 3 p.m.
In London on Thursday, Chelsea fights the UEFA League video tons at 3:00 p.m..
There are 832 deaths in Indonesia's tsunami.
A national disaster agency reported earlier on Sunday that 832 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Public relations correspondent Stpo Pulwa Ngugroho reported that many people were trapped in debris in buildings that fell from Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake and that waves of 20 feet high were raised.
In the Paral, where there are 380,000 people, there's debris in the destroyed building.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for killing a woman.
A criminal investigation took place this morning at Bilkenhead on the Mermaidside.
A 44-year-old man who was stabbed to death at Grayson Mus on John Street was found at 7:55 a.m. and arrested by a 32-year-old man.
Police are calling for information on the local people.
Detective Brian O'Hagan says, "The investigation was started early, but it is calling for information on the people in the Bikenhead on the merge side.
Especially since we've been listening to the cab driver's footage of an important investigation being recorded in Dashcam."
A police spokesman confirmed that a woman's body was found in the Bilkenhead region and died in the house.
In the afternoon, a friend who knew women arrived at the scene to be questioned about the place where the woman was found this morning.
The police are in the process of informing the neighboring houses of the victims, and the investigation is ongoing.
When a taxi driver in Grayson Mus wants to get back to his building, he is told that police can't get inside the building.
When he understood what happened, he didn't say anything.
It is now said that the residents will be allowed inside in a few hours.
I heard police say the whole city is treated as a murder scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
He kept saying, "That's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars in the line, and the other was right outside.
Some cops were on the rope, watching the building block.

The statue of Cromwell of the House of Parliament is the latest monument to the revocation of history.
The expulsion was poetic justice, for the destruction of many British cultural and religious artifacts, such as the Taliban, by fanatic Puritans.
He said that the Cromwell Society is trying to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said, "It was inevitable that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster should be targeted in the current debate about the removal of images.
The symbol of the British civil war was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a different Cromwell was sacrificed by the actions of his ancestors in the previous century.
The grand representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Sonycroft is evidence of the ideas of the 19th century and is part of a historical record of people who still believe that many are worthy of a celebration.
Goldsmith, in his Sunday teleograph, says: "Clomwell was a champion of Congress against anti-oppression by the latter part of the 19th century, and, of course, he was a monarchy.
It is the subject of ongoing historical debate as to whether it is completely correct or not.
It is true that during the mid-17th century, conflict shaped the development of the country, and Cromwell is a recognized figure of the division.
"He is worthy to be celebrated and commemorated as Lord Proctor."
The Moors of the killer pig will kill the Chinese farmer.
According to local media, farmers were attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwest China.
A man who only knew the name "Yuan" reported on Sunday that his artery was cut in the market for six-bed water in the state of São Paulo and that he was found bleeding around the stable.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was vaccinating pigs at a pig farm in the western state of China.
He and his cousin were moved to sell 15 pigs on the market in neighboring Tokyo on Wednesday.
The next morning, my cousin found him dead, and found that the door was open to the village next to him.
Inside the hut, there was a big, bloody osprey.
According to the report, legal tests confirmed that a pig of 550 killed a farmer.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and ruined," he said, according to the Guiyang Egening News:
The camera shows Yuan entering the market to feed pigs at 4:40 p.m. Thursday afternoon.
The body had been dead for an hour.
The pig that killed the man wasn't his cousin.
Market administrators told Emening News that pigs were quarantined so no one could hurt them, and police were gathering evidence.
Yuan's family and market managers are said to be negotiating compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack humans before.
In 2016, on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig attacked a woman and her husband and seriously injured their husband.
Ten years ago, 650 pounds of pigs trapped Wales farmers in trucks, and his wife got rid of the animals.
After farmers in Oregon were eaten by pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can be a trigger.
"I'm just going to play with you.
I don't mean to be curious or hunting.
"I don't know what I'm talking about, but I have to be honest with you."
Hurricane Rosa's remnants bring heavy rains to the Southwest of the United States.
As predicted, the hurricane Rosa is losing its strength as it passes through the cold water north of the Gulf of Mexico.
But in the next few days, the flooding will continue to sweep North Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
The wind of Rosa was 85 miles an hour when it was a category-level hurricane at five o'clock in the morning.
Rosa's expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, new trafs are born in the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States.
On Monday Rosa brought some 10 inches of rain to Mexico.
And when the humidity of the tropics comes along with the approaching traf, there will be heavy rains in the southwest in the next few days.
In the region, one-four inches of rain will be a threat, such as flooding, mud currents and landslides.
The high tropical humidity increases rainfall, especially in parts of Arizona and southern Nevada, from 2 to 3 inches per hour.
Some parts of the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona, rain falls 2 to 4 inches.
The result of the rain of the tropical rain which causes the flooding, and the situation may become very severe.
So it is very dangerous to walk into the desert while there are tropical rains.
The heavy rain would cause the valley to become a river, and lightning and strong winds would strike in the area, and dust would blow.
The closer Traff brings heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
It could rain more than half an inch, and it could cause small mud currents or road slips.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
In late Sundays and early Mondays, sudden tropical rains are approaching Arizona, and the rain will spread on Mondays and Tuesdays.
The heavy rains are expected to spread widely during Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
In October, the temperature in the Arctic Circle drops rapidly in the United States, but the tropics remains quite warm.
It can lead to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sundays, there are examples of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
In Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Iowa, St. Louis and Demoin, there are about 20 degrees of temperature.
In the next few days, the rising heat of summer will increase again.
When it reaches 80 degrees north and north, many in the central and eastern parts of the United States expect to get warmer in October.
On Tuesday, New York can reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term weather forecast predicts that in the first half of October, temperatures often exceed average in the east of the United States.
More than 20 million people will listen to Bret Kavano.
More than 20 million saw Bret Kavano, a candidate for the Supreme Court, on Thursday, and a woman who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, on Friday’s ground floor, Senator Jeff Freck, designed to conduct a week's investigation against the FBI, the broadcaster stopped the normal program and continued its political support.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100% sure Kavano was going to get drunk and take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavano testified that it would never happen.
According to Neilsen, more than 200,000 people saw it on Friday.
So, this is the first time that we've seen this, we've seen this.
The number of other companies such as PBS, C-SPAN, Fox Business Network, could not be obtained immediately.
Nealsen has a problem with people watching in their offices all the time.
In general, it's the same number of players in football games and Academy awards.
Fox News Channell says that some hosts strongly support Kavano's appointment, so Neilsen won an average of 569 million viewers at a one-day hearing.
ABC was the second of 326 million viewers.
According to Neilsen, CBS is 33.1 million, NBC is 2.4 million, MSNBC is 2.8 million, CNN is 2.2 million.
It's been a topic after the interview.
Freck was the lead man on Friday.
A moderate Republican announced that he would vote for Kavano, and on Friday morning, he was surrounded by CNN and CBS journalists and shouts from protesters when he tried to get into the elevators in the hearings of the Judicial Committee.
He was standing with his eyes closed while he was being picked up on a live broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He also said, "The woman is weak and you have power."
According to Freck, his office made a statement saying that more should be said in the hearing of the committee before the elevator closed.
A few hours later, when the Judicial Committee has appointed Kavano to vote for all the senators, all broadcast stations will start live broadcasts at that time.
But he said he did so only with the understanding that the FBI will investigate the claims of candidates next week, as a few Democrats claim.
He was somewhat certain of his conversation with his friend, Republican Senator Chris Cohns.
After talking to the Cawnes and other senators, he decided.
The choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans could not vote for Kavano without investigation.
President Cards has the FBI investigating the charges against Kavano.
The British Prime Minister May criticized the criticism of "the politics game" over Bregit:
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May criticized the criticism that the future of the United Kingdom is being "funded by politics" in a plan to leave the EU:
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May will attend a conservative parliament in Armingham, England.
In other reports, her former minister, Boris Johnson, on the front page of the newspaper, highlighted his attack on the so-called checkers program as "very nice" for Britain and the EU to collect customs for each other.
Police have arrested the suspect, Diete-Simpson, regarding the death of an LSU player who's been beaten by Wade Sims.
Police arrested a 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims, who was shot and killed.
The Baton Rouge Police said he was arrested for the second murder and imprisoned at the age of 20.
The authorities released the video, showing Sims and Simsson fighting, and police pointed out that Sims lost his glasses on the way.
A CBS series WAFB reported that the police found glasses at the scene, and that there was a thinker's DNA there.
After interviewing Simpson, the police admitted that he shot Wade and injured him.
It was reported that the fee was $350,000.
The M.E.'s office in East Baton Rouge issued a temporary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The agency said it was able to get arrested with the help of the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police's Institute of Crime, the Southern University police and local citizens.
LSU Assets Director Joe Ariva thanked the regional law enforcement agency for "the hard work and the pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne played basketball at the LSU.
In the last season, he won an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 lireundds.
Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wead says his team has been "crushed" by Wade's death.
"I've been afraid of you," Weid says.
There's a volcano in Mexico City that's spewing ash.
The ash from Popocatepetl has reached the south side of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Center warned them to leave the volcano on Saturday and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours from the crater.
The center was watching the shaking and the shaking.
A social media image shows the ash covering the windshield of a car near Mexico City, such as Sochimirco.
Geologists confirmed that since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017, there has been an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The Catalonia Separatists and police clash with the police for the anniversary of the independent vote
Six people were arrested on Saturday after a pro-responsive clash with the police in Barcelona, and thousands attended the annual rally of the Catalonia Party.
When a group of pro-discipliners pushed their faces, they threw eggs, powdered paint, and created dark dust clouds in the usual streets of tourists.
Scaffles also used their security to end the fighting on that day with the police.
For several hours, a group of pro-parents have been fighting against the coalition calling out, "Remember, forgive, and die," and "O Spain, for ever."
According to the local newspaper, 14 people are being treated with light skin from protesters.
A year later, tensions are rising in an independent region that has been considered illegal by Madrid but has been blessed by the Separatist Catalonias.
There was an overwhelming vote of independence, but the opposition was a low vote because of boycotting.
According to the authorities of Catalonia, police tried to stop the election in the polling area last year, where about 1,000 people were injured.
A group of pro-Americans camped all Friday night to stop the protest with the support of the state police.
The work progressed, but we were forced to go another way.
An electrical engineer, Narciss Termes, and 68-year-olds, who are participating in the activities of his wife and the Separatists, says that Catalonia is no longer a hope for independence.
Last year was a great opportunity.
I watched my parents cry and weep because they could vote, but now they're stuck."
Despite a small victory during last December's regional elections, the independent Party of Catalonia is also struggling to take the initiative this year for the decision on the organizing of the vote and their role in the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
John Puig, 42-year-old Mecanic, who was recording the protests on the phone for the police, said that the conflict was growing by both politicians:
"I'm more tense," he says.
Orioll Funkelas is one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial prison last year, but he announced on Sunday that he will be running for the European Parliament next year.
"The European election is the best way to condemn the neglect and oppression of democracy we received from the Spanish government," he says.
The men who were arrested for bumping into the house in Londonbury.
Three men, 33, 34, 39, were arrested while bumping into their homes in Londonbury.
The incident took place at Barrynard Crest, around 1:30 p.m. on Thursday's BST hour.
Det Inst Bob Bremings said the gates and buildings themselves suffered damage.
Looks like a crossbow was fired from the car.
So, let's go back to this example. So, let's go back to the Menga strike.
I made sure that Rivingston was won in the first goal of Dory Menga.
The rangers were surprised that Livingstone gave a second defeat to Steve Gerard, the manager of the Ibbys Club in 18 games.
As Gary Holt's side is on the other side, the level with the second hybrid has proved to be different.
The side of Gerrard remains undefeated by the season's Premium.
Before that, the Rangers of Thursday will be holding the Lapidween in the European League.
In the meantime, Livingstone expands their undefeated series of games into six games.
Livingston missed a chance for a dull visitor
Holt's team would've been leading the race long before they score.
Scott Robinson broke through, dragged his efforts towards the goal, and after Alan Lithgolow had done that, he could only tell the wide range of efforts after his slides to fill the finish of Craig Harket's finish beyond the goal.
The host was happy to be able to play in front of them.
And that's how the important goal was achieved.
The Rangers admitted to free kicks, Rivingston went into openings and set up Menga in combination with Declan Gallagher and Robinson.
By that point, the Rangers had controlled their property, but they couldn't get through the home-diff fence, and the goalkeeper, Lim Krelly, had hardly been in the way.
Alfredo Morelos forced the rescue from Kery, but the pattern continued until later.
Scott Pittman was denied by what he saw in the Rangers' goalkeeper Alanmarcreger and Lisgo's foot wide open from another Livingstone set.
In contrast to the fact that the cross came into the Livingston box and had been cleared for a long time, Harket was replaced by Green Middleton, and the two penalty games were rejected.
The phenomenon of Rivingston.
I've been to Tony Macaronia, BBC Scotland, Alas Alamont.
The incredible performance and results of Livingston.
They were good for men, and they were beyond expectations of their higher tracks.
He's got a lot of credit for the way he's fed the team since he got back on top flight.
He had a lot of heroes.
Mengah has taken advantage of Conor Goldson and John Wallall, while Captain Harket has gathered a wonderful organized defense.
The rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
They were not as good as they were sometimes under Gerrard.
They had no final ball, and only once they opened the home side--and it was like an awakening call for the Rangers.
I'm getting mixed receptions in Eldoan, Cologne.
On Saturday (September 29), Turkish and German leaders gathered for breakfast in Berlin, and there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day Eldoan visited Germany, and is intended to restore the relationship between NATO's allies.
They discussed human rights, freedom of the press, Turkey's EU membership.
El Doorlin then went to open a huge new mosque in Cologne.
This city is home to the largest population of Turkey outside Turkey.
The police have given security reasons to prevent more than 25,000 strong crowds from gathering in front of the mosques, but many supporters have been found nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Eldoan protesters (most of whom Kurdish) also heard their voices and condemned the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflect the disrepute between visitors and visitors who are welcomed as heroes by some German-American Turks, and who are criticized by others.
[Deptford Road Conflict:] A car crash killed a bike driver
A bike driver died in a car crash in London.
The crash took place at 10:15 British time, near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, in the south of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
About a mile from the crash on Saturday, another bicycle driver died in a hit-and-run on Chailder Street.
The Metropolitan police said the police are encouraging male identification and reports of relatives.
Roads have been closed and buses have been bypassed, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Longlatin Prison: Six guards were injured in a riot.
Six guards were injured in a heavily guarded male prison, the warden said.
At HMP Longlatin in Worcestershire, around 09:30 British time, there is still a disturbance.
Special "Turnad" guards were called to address the disturbance in the wings of eight inmates.
Officers were given minor injuries to their faces and were treated at the scene.
The prison representative said: "Specially trained guards were put in place to deal with the events of HMP Longlatin.
Six members of the staff were treated for injuries.
"We will not allow violence in prison, and those who are held accountable will be referred to by the police and will spend more time in prison."
HMP Longlatin is holding over 500 of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the warden was reported to have been attacked by a prisoner and treated in a hospital.
In October, the police were called to prison to deal with the serious disturbances that took place in the Biliyard balls.
Hurricane Rosa's flash flood has threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (the drought zone may have benefits)
Although tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, there is a very high chance that a flash flood will occur at the beginning of next week, as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy runs across the Southwest Desert.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash alerts from west Arizona, including Phoenix, Flags, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City to southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah on Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to come in late Monday with rain and direct fire at Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said on Twitter: "There are only 10 tropical storms and low-pressure air pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!"
Katrina (67) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest National Harken Center model predicts that it will be between 2 and 4 inches of rain and that it will be the maximum rain level in the Arizona Mogoronim.
Other parts of the Southwest Desert, including Central Rocky and Great Bayssen, could be from one to two inches and up to four inches of the rarest.
The area is affected by drought, and those who are not at risk of flash flood can be provided with Rosa rain.
The floods are very serious, but since the Southwest is now in a drought state, some rain can be beneficial.
According to the United States, more than 40 percent of Arizona is at least in the ultimate drought, which is in the second highest category.
In the beginning, the path of the hurricane Loza is across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa's strength is 85 miles per hour in Sunday morning, rising north at 12 miles per hour, located south of Punta Eugeneia, Mexico.
The storm hit cold water in the Pacific, and it's losing its grip.
It is estimated that the tropical pressure will land in Mexico on Monday afternoon, or at night.
There's a huge risk of flooding in Mexico.
"The total rainfall of three to six inches, the maximum of 10 inches, is expected in Sonorah, northwest of Baja California."
Rosa will cross Mexico as a tropical storm before approaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday.
"Roza, and its effects will be the main danger to Baja California, western Sonora, and the very high rainfall in the United States," said the National Hall of Hurricanes in the Southwest Desert."
It is expected that this rain will cause flash floods, mud currents in the desert, and landslides in the mountains.

Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after they found a stab wound in Samaset.
A teenage boy was found injured in Ecceerioteras in Mid-Sama Note, around 4:00 BST.
He's taken to the hospital. He's in stable condition.
Summersset police said a 17-year-old man, 18-year-old and 20-year-old, was arrested overnight in Rad stock in Avon.
The police are waiting for someone to come forward with a picture of what happened.
The card says Kabano is suffering from the degenerative and angry state of the Democrats.
"The judge's vote on Kabano is a vote that shows denial of the democratic regime's harsh and vicious approach."
The card said that Kabano was suffering from the "lowliness and anger of the Democrats" and that he was in his appointment.
Kabano testified before the parliament on Thursday and strongly denied her claim of sexual assault on Christine Breseyford when they were teenagers decades ago.
Feed also testified to her claims in court.
The president said on Saturday, "The people of the United States saw the beauty, character and courage of the Kabano that day."
"A vote approved by Judge Kabano is one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a vote approved by a legal expert with a great record of public affairs." "He told a crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
When the president was talking about the importance of Republicans in the middle elections, he went a long way to refer to Kabano's recommendation:
"One of the most important elections in our lives is five weeks.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running around.
"That's why I'm everywhere to fight for the great candidates."
The cards argued that Democrats were meant to resist and interfere.
When the first key process vote in the Senate office of Kabano will take place by Friday, the chief executive of the GOP said to CNN:
Hundreds of people have been killed in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia, and casualties are on the rise.
Authorities said on Saturday that a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, killing at least 384 people and causing many to be washed away.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at the festival of Parmor's beach, and at sunset, waves of up to six meters (18 meters) swept to the shore, killing many and destroying all the roads.
The tsunami followed an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were killed because they were active on the beach and did not escape immediately."
"The tsunami did not come alone, pulled cars, timbers, houses, and hit all the land," Nogroho said, adding that it came to the outside world at 800 kph (497 mph) speed before it hit the shore.
Some people, he said, climbed trees and survived to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people evacuated to the 24 center of Par.
An aerial photo published by the Occupy Agency shows buildings and shops destroyed, bridges destroyed and mosques surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued in coastal cities.
I could feel a series of earthquakes in areas with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Assessment Technology Applications Agency (BPPT) declared that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was about 200 times as powerful as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geographic location on the edge of the long narrow bay said the tsunami could have expanded.
Nogrojo explained that the damage was a wide range and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Some of the victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed building, he added that 5,540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nogrojo said that the casualties and the damage were worse on the coast of 300 km (190 mires) north of the Par, than in a region called Dongara, near the quake's origin.
"The information from Dongara has been completely disabled," Ngroho said.
The Red Cross stated in a statement that more than 300,000 people live there, and added that they were headed for areas where staff and volunteers were affected.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
The government officials said the wave came during the warning, but on Saturday, authorities were widely criticized for not letting the tsunami know that it hit the pulsar.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man upstairs in the building screaming for warning of a tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashed into the shore and the building and car were washed away.
Reuter couldn't authenticate the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power failure, and the lack of communication around the branch made it difficult for authorities to coordinate their rescue operations.
The military is now transporting relief supplies from jackalta and other cities, but the refugees are still in great need of food and other basic necessities.
City airports will remain closed until October, only for relief efforts.
President Joko Widde will visit Par's evacuation center on Sunday.
Indonesia has more than 800 tsunami victims.
Very bad.
The staff of the World vision in Dongara survived the city of Par, where the workers had fled to the tarp shelters in their offices, but they said they saw the devastation in the streets.
"I've seen the house," he said. "I've seen the house," said the Voice.
Very bad.
Relief groups have begun to demonstrate how disaster relief efforts have been launched, but some claim that the journey of foreign relief workers with deep expertise has been blocked.
According to Indonesia's regulations, supplies and people from abroad will only be distributed if disaster sites are declared to be a national disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a state-level disaster," said Aria Ariani, representative of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
" once the government says, "This is a national disaster," we say we are not yet in that state to receive international support."
On the second night in the Friday earthquake and after the tsunami, friends and family still missing were hoping that their loved ones were the miracle of the tragic story of the natural disaster.
The boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuer rescued the woman who was trapped under the rubble for two days beside her mother's body.
Gendon Sbandno, coach of Indonesia's National Paraplasticing Team, trained two missing riders at the Asian convention that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to those locked up in the Loloa Hotel, including Mandagi, his students were also.
"I have my own emotional burden as a senior in the realm of paraguding."
In a few hours after the collapse of the Loyola Hotel, Gendon went between the Paragulling community and told whatsApp was desperate to send a message to the pal's competition that was taking part in the beach festival:
His message was that instead of making a blue check, only a gray check mark was made.
"I think it means that the message didn't come."
In Levy's Newport, a thief robbed $226,750 while remanded the ATM.
According to news release from the police station in Newport, thieves stole $226,750 while a Bink employee was replenishing at the Newport, Levy.
The car driver emptied the ATMs of the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money.
While he was working, another man came running from behind a blue employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
According to the release, the witness saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not identify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
If you have any information about their identity, please contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Canier West:
The trumpet canine West will change his name to Ye.
When he announced his change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It is officially known as Canier West."
West, 41 years old, is sometimes nicknamed Ye, and his nickname was also used as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change will take place before his new album, Yandhi, is expected to be released at Saturday Night Live.
He said he was going to show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, which he canceled for emotional reasons.
Like the shorthand of his current professional name, West once said that the word had religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'Ye' is the most common word in the Bible, which means 'you' in the Bible,' and West said earlier this year, and spoke about the big boy and his album title on radio host.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us."
We're going to start in the only sense of the word, we're going to be in the image of our good and evil and confused.
The album reflects more who we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Kommuz announced his choice this year, named Love and Brother Love, which is known to many as Paf Dadi, P.Ty or Dedi.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborationer, also made the hyphenation and capitalization of Hyphenan.
Mexico's AMLO swears the use of the army against its citizens.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, vowed never to use military force against ordinary citizens by the country's 50th anniversary of blood retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Traterco Plaza that he would never use his military powers to control the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, when the left-wing student movement was rooted in Latin America, an army fired fire at peaceful demonstrations in Plaza, 300 people died at the time.
Lopez Obrador promises to provide monthly supplements to the students, to provide free release to the national university, and to support young Mexicans.
He said that the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities made young people run to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double A.I. financial support.
As China moves more actively in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it takes to study the field, says Kii-Fu Lee, an investor in Google, Microsoft or Apple.
The U.S. has a general lack of AI strategy, but the comment was made after the AI announcement was made in various departments of the U.S. government.
Meanwhile, China has introduced its plans last year: by 2030, it will be the number one in AI innovation.
Doubleing the AI research budget would be a good start to consider that all other countries are much slower than the United States, and we want to take another step in AI, Lee said.
This week, Lee wrote in a CNBC interview:
The book AI Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order is issued this month by Horton Mifflin Harkot, who invests in Face++, China's most famous AI company.
In the 1980s, he created an AI system that beat the U.S.'s top solo player, after which he became an Executive for Microsoft Research and was president of Google China.
Lee agreed to a previous US government technical competition, such as the Lobotics Challenge of the National Institute of Advanced Research, and asked when he would be next to help find future observers.
American researchers say they work hard to get government subsidy:
"No, China is not taking a academic leader; it's cooperation," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently hired leaders from universities to study AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy will also help strengthen US AI efforts.
"I think PHD in AI should automatically have a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Ministry of State issued the next generation of artificial intelligence development plans.
While China's National Science Foundation provides funds to the scientific community in a similar way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies pay their researchers in the United States, Leye says the quality of research in China is low:
Earlier this year in the United States, the Ministry of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to join companies and academic partners, and the White House announced a special committee for artificial intelligence.
Now, the month DARPA announced that it will invest $2 billion in the initiative called AI Next.
We're now investing more than 100 million dollars a year in the NSF.
On the other hand, the U.S. rule to establish an artificial security committee has not been seen acting for months.
Macedonians vote for the country's name after its name.
Macedonians will change the name of the country to "the Republic of North Macedonia" on Sunday, or vote to resolve a decade-old dispute between Greece and the European Union and the NATO, which has stopped the election.
Greece, which has a state called Macedonia, voted to join NATO and the EU, saying that the Northerners claimed their territory.
The two governments signed a treaty based on a new name proposed in June, arguing that the change would destroy the ethnic identity of the major Slav population in Macedonia.
President George Iwanov is not voting for a national vote, but the boycott campaign is questioning whether the voter will meet the minimum 50 percent of the votes that will enable them to vote.
Read the questions on the vote: "Do you agree to accept an agreement with Greece and become a member of NATO and EU?"
Supporters of renamed names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worthwhile for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslav, to join institutions like the EU and NATO.
"I will be free to live under the umbrella of the European Union today for the future of the country, because it means a safer life for all of us."
We don't have the legal restraints, but enough members of the parliament say they will follow the results of their vote for decision.
The name change would require two-thirds of the parliament.
The week's election committee said there were no reports of fraud by 1:00 p.m.
However, the voting rate was only 16 per cent compared with the 34 per cent of the last parliamentary vote in 2016.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Giose Tanevski, a voter for the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zoca, and his son Dallas participated in Macedonia's national election on September 30, 2018, on the country's name change for the country's name, which will open the way for them to join the NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kabermarkov, 54 years old, pulled a chair in front of a tent set up by the boycotters of the national vote.
"We agree with NATO and the EU, but we want to participate, not through a service door, but with care," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but we are noble.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, they can rely on other countries like China and Russia to become part of the European Asian integration."
The Prime Minister says that the NATO membership will bring more than 20 percent of the unemployment investment in Macedonia.
"I believe that the majority support the EU and NATO because more than 80 percent of the people support the EU and NATO."
He said the result of "yes" would be "the proof of our future."
According to the Macedonian Policy Research Institute last Monday, public opinion last week said 30 to 43 percent of voters will participate in a national election – lowering the required vote rate.
In another poll conducted by Thelma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the respondents said they are going to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote for consent.
It takes 50 percent and one vote to succeed.
Failure to vote will be the first serious blow to the European government since its beginning in May.
(Applause)
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Starling won a 2-0 victory in Manchester City on Sunday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the score in 65 minutes so ridiculously easy.
Argentina's strikers were passed in midfield at the beginning of the series.
He raced with three Brighton Differs before entering the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed away one Differ and cut out more at the edge of the Brighton box.
And he found Starling and put a pass on his left.
English champion FW used a first touch inside the box to return the ball to Agero, and used his right boots to beat Brighton'skeeper, Matthew Ryan, and then hit the shooter on the right side of the net.
"Aguero was struggling with foot issues."
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he decided to score at that moment."
But it was Starling who gave him the first swing in the Premium League fight.
That goal happened in 29 minutes.
Aguero took the ball deep in Brighton.
He sent a beautiful slupass along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sone kicked Starling a few times before he turned him to the post.
Just before SkyBlue's forwards slipped into the border, he pushed the ball into the net.
The city will compete with Hofenheim in the champions ’ League match on Tuesday, 12:55 at the Rhine Necker Arena in Jinsheim, Germany.
He's the killer, the Rockys who want to play with the Spoilers.
The Nationals have been removed from the playoff, so there's not much reason to start a new one.
But the combatant killer wants to take a notice of the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if it still has a playoff effect on the Rockys, who lead the Los Angeles Dugges in the NL West.
Rockys won at least a wildcard spot for the Nationals on Friday night, but he wants to ensure his first district win.
“Even if we’re playing without meaning or meaning, we can throw at least, and with the crowd, it’s probably the highest level of play we’ll ever encounter here in Denver and any other team.
"I'm not sure you want to fight in that way."
Although the Nationals haven't published the Sunday Star yet, they're reporting they're going to welcome Shazer to the pitch in such a situation.
He's going to start his 34th day and throw at the Brüpen season on Thursday and he's going to throw at the usual Sunday break.
This season in Washington, D.C. has a right-hander at 220.3% in Inning, 2.53 ERA and 300 trigonometry.
The cards were a big rally in West Virginia.
When the president was talking about the importance of Republicans in the middle elections, he went a long way to refer to the situation in which the Supreme Court has chosen Bret Kabano:
"All we've done is in November.
"One of the most important elections in our lives is five weeks.
This is one of the big--I don't run, but I'm actually running around, so I'm everywhere to fight for the great candidates.
The cards kept going, "Look at this terrible party of Democrats and you can see what's happening now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt or who they hurt to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we will not hand it over to them.
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and interfere."
"And you will see it for the last four days."
He took the Senate Judicial Committee to compete with Democrat Senator Diane Finestein in the name of his name, and received a huge field of publicity from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did the paperwork leak?
Oh, shit.
"No, no, no, I'm really terrible body language, waiting for the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labor Party is no longer a large church.
I can't stand people talking about their hearts.
When my local political party’s Momenham activists voted to evacuate me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I’m in the front row of MPs who are said to be not welcome - all speak the spirit.
My member of parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because he stood up to anti-Semitism:
In my case, the blame was caused by not agreeing with Jeremy Colvin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, and ironicly, Jeremy did not agree with his former leader in Europe.
“We want to make the meeting comprehensive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local labor force MP, Friday night's GC meeting was just like that.
Sad to say, for a long time, the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has been forgotten today, rather than the tone of many meetings and if it actually began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that various opinions are not accepted by the working party, and that all opinions are only judged as acceptable by the party's leaders.
This started right after Jeremy became leader, and my colleagues who thought I had similar political views started to turn around and ask me to take the position that I had never seen before, otherwise I would agree on national security or the single market of the EU.
Whenever I went public, I said that there was a trend toward harassment against social media, such as demanding that I speak out of the country’s way, and blaming the center's policy, and that I shouldn't join the labor party.
And that's not my experience alone.
In fact, my comments tend to be political, and I think they are better off than some of my colleagues.
I face a daily cycle of sexist or racist abuse, but I fear the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who will never be shy.
One of the most discouraging aspects of this political era is the level of abuse that has become normal.
Last week Jeremy Colvin argued that the Labor Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
It is true that we are no longer a large church, and that there is a decline in all "untrustful" movements or changes in the party's rules of choice.
Over the past two years, I have been humble so as not to be too loud, and I have given much advice to ‘all is well’.
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
The neglect of the Sascher government, which literally destroyed my general school classroom since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago, led me to try to support better public services for local parliaments or government ministers who most needed them.
I have never hidden my policy, including the last election.
No one was confused in Nottingham East about my political position and the areas in which I disagree with the current leader.
For those who promoted the movement on Friday, I can tell you that the country is struggling against the Braggjet that causes family, business, and our public service, and does not understand the energy of time and my loyalty to working party leaders.
But the message from me is not to the Momentum of Nottingham, but to my supporters, whether a laborer or not: I am proud to work for you, and I promise you that I will not suppress my actions from my belief that the threat or political advantage is the best that you can get.
Chris Resley is an MP for the Nottingham East.
Air 38-17.
The two late trials may have changed the final results somewhat, but air is absolutely worthy of victory in today’s excellent entertainment tennis match.
Now they're on the top of the table.
Finally, by getting better opportunities on the excellent difaft, Peter Murchi, coaching homeside, has every right to be happy.
"We have been tested through the games, and we should still be undefeated and happy."
Melrose's Robin Christy said: "Trust in air; they've got better opportunities than we do."
The 14th-minute trial of Grant Anderson, instead of Flager Cremo, pushed the air, started with Wally's match, gave the numbers to Merlotte with the Rolly Hughes Yellow Card, and Jason Baggot took the untransferable test.
Chilimo extended the air lead at the end of half-time at the end of the day at the end of the day, choosing a solo test and taking a break in the air at 17-5.
But Merlotte went into the latter half, and Patrick Anderson's trial from Baggot was reduced to five points.
After that, he waited a long time for Rudid Nott to leave the house in a badly injured stretcher, and the air continued to move forward with his test of Stamford McDowall.
The air-acting captain Blair McPherson received a yellow card, and Melrose again dismissed the extra players at Bruce Corvin's try.
However, the homeside came back, and Shruan Hutchinson took the yellow card without the ball, and landed in the back of the airport, where McPherson moved forward from the penalty-lined out.
After Kyle Law collected David Armstrong's box kicks, Krimo sent Franco's Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt on the home side, almost from the start.
The Stick Game Star will create a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game Star Ford Kieran seems ready to move to the Holocaust industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a restaurant where he obtained a license.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis writes with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill, and plays a popular BBC show.
Duo announced that the 9th series will be one of the last shows and Kyenan seems to have a plan for his life after Claygrand.

Through inland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lines lost in the bloody 19th century conflict in Chile is still vivid – the hope of sailing again through the Pacific Ocean.
On October 1, Bolivia is probably the best hope for decades to wait for the International Court's decision after a five-year debate.
"Bolivia has a momentum, solidarity and a calm spirit, and, of course, expect positive results," said Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Carzadilla.
Many Bolivians see the ICJ's ruling on national screens and expect to agree with Bolivia's claim that after decades of optimistic discussion, the Haug court has been obliged to negotiate with Bolivia’s sovereignty.
Evo Morales, the president of Bolivia's indigenous peoples, who are facing the next year's re-election debate, will also participate in Monday's ruling.
At the end of August, he swore, "We're very close to returning to the Pacific.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia in good terms, and that it will not change much.
The Dutch-based United Nations agency states that it does not have the authority to grant Chilean territory and that it does not decide the outcome of possible consultations.
The ICJ's decision was made only six months after the final discussion, indicating that the case was “not complicated,” said the International Law expert Patz Zarate.
And it may have been a long way to advance the cause of Bolivia, or it may have been a setback in the past four years.
"The problem with access to the sea was taken over by the current government of Bolivia," she said.
"I'm going to go to Chile," she said. "I'm going to go back to Chile," she said.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to discuss at some point, but it is extremely difficult to continue the discussion later.
Since 1962, the two countries have not traded ambassadors.
Former President Eduard Rodríguez Verzez, the president of Bolivia at Haug, denied the notion that the court's decision is unusually swift:
On Monday, he said, Bolivia would be a “special opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and provide an opportunity to “put an end to the 139 years of mutual debates” about mutual interests.
Carzadira also denied that Morales (one of the most popular presidents in Latin America) is using the ocean as a political support.
"Bolivia never gives up her right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to learn that we need to go through the past."
North Koreans say nuclear disarmament will not happen if they can't trust the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister Li Yonho says if Washington can't be trusted, then the country will never disarm nuclear weapons first.
Li was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to follow the promise made during the Singapore summit between its rival leaders:
The Secretary of State, Mike Pupeo, seems to be trying to resume nuclear diplomacy more than three months after North Korea's Kim Jong-un took part.
Li says that the US's objection to the declaration of continuing sanctions and ending the Korean war is a “ideal dream” to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to this declaration without entering into the first important disarmament movement.
Both Kim and the US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a growing suspicion that Makoto is seriously trying to abandon a weapon he thinks is the only way to ensure security.
Pompeo is going to visit Chim-Trump in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit next month.
The fashion show in Paris has released a massive headware update and is being carried to high streets near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun, it's settled.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown announced an unusual oversize head-carp for the SS-19 collection of runways that attracted style in Paris's fashion Week:
A very unrealistic hat rolled Instagram this summer, and these designers sent Catwalk their eye - watching works.
This was a picture of a boudoir top hat with a large feathered feather on the head of a model.
Other oversize jewelry had jewelry watermelons, wizard hats, and pineapples, but they were not designed to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also released a strange mask reception--and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks sewed up their lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than Autoktur.
One piece was similar to a complete Scuba diving gear in the Snokel and Goggles, but another was like a melted ice cream cone.
You're lucky if you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that giant hoods may be going to high streets near you.
The largest hat is hot for the heel of the straw hat La Bonva, which is two feet wide, from Riana to Emily Ratazikovski.
The cult brand behind the very unrealistic hat on social media is a beach bag about as large as a floating model.
The orange lafierre bag with its lafiergen border and white leather handle was outstanding for the collection of La Liviera SS 19 of the Paris fashion Week.
"We expect big hats and beach bags to appear on high streets next summer" - designers will have such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for over-size accessory.
John Edwards: Language skills that are essential for global citizens.
Scotland’s private schools have been doing excellent academic performances, and have continued to be another set of tests that are strengthened only by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music, and other community performances until 2018.
These schools, represented by the Scotland Independent School Council (SCIS), which has more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are endeavoring to provide the highest level of services for students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for higher education, their chosen careers, and life in society as global citizens.
The educational sector, which can design and implement custom-made school curriculums, shows that modern languages continue to be a popular school subject.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak words you get into people's heads.
"I don't know what you're talking about.
This reminds us not to rely only on English when building relationships and trusts with other countries.
The recent results of this year show that language is the top member of the league table and that students in private schools are most likely to pass.
The total number of students learning a foreign language has been 68 percent of the students who have received the HayergradeA.
Data collected from 74 schools in SCIS shows that 72 percent of the students in Beijing get their Hayergrade A, 72 percent of the students in German, 69 percent of the students in French, and 63 percent of the students in Spanish also get A.
This shows that a private school in Scotland encourages learning a foreign language as an important skill that will definitely be needed for children and young people in the future.
Language is now treated as a choice subject, as is science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and other subjects in private schools.
A 2014 survey of the British Office of Labor and Technology found that 17 percent of the hard work that employers had to do to fill the vacancies were due to lack of language skills.
So language skills are increasingly essential for young people to prepare for future careers.
In the case that globalization increases opportunities for work that requires language, these skills are essential.
Whatever career you choose, if you get a foreign language, you will acquire this lifelong skill and will have a real advantage in the future.
It's very important to be able to communicate directly with foreign peoples.
According to a Japan Gov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent did not have sufficient language skills to communicate, and the ratio of people who spoke to them was only 15 percent French.
It is important for children today to invest in language education for that reason.
Children in the developing world, especially those with multiple language abilities, will have greater opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught from different schools.
Many schools focus on the more traditional modern languages, but in other schools, they will be teaching them what they consider to be the most important language for the United Kingdom, such as Beijing and Japanese.
Regardless of what interests children, private schools with expert teachers in the field have a lot of language options.
In Scotland, private schools focus on providing a learning environment where children can prepare for the future and develop the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
In a global business environment, language continues to be so important to the future of the country that it needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should be regarded as an international communication skill.
Private schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice and diversity and better education.
I should do it.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Private School of Scotland.
LeBron, Sunday in San Diego.
Leblon James will soon display his fan-gauge Los Angeles Lakes deview.
Luke Walton, director of the Leakers, announced on Sunday that James will be in the first season in San Diego with Denver Nagetz.
But I don't know how long he'll play.
"It's going to be less than 48 minutes in less than a minute."
Leakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James plays only for a limited amount of time:
After his early training this week, James was asked about the schedule of the 6th game in Lekers' pre-time.
"This stage of my career doesn't need a pre-time game to prepare for the season."
Larry, West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start a series of elections tonight from Vienna, West Virginia.
It's the first meeting in five places scheduled next week, including such friendly places as Tennesy and Mississippi.
Now that the vote has been suspended for the approval of the Supreme Court, Trump is trying to strengthen its support for the coming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing over half of their parliament in November elections.
Can you watch the meeting in West Virginia tonight and online?
The assembly in West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
In West Virginia, Larry can watch online at the live stream on YouTube:
While the FBI investigates the charge of sexual assault on the candidate of the Supreme Court, Trump is more likely to comment on the hearings of Canono this week, despite the fact that it has been delayed for up to a week and a half.
But the main purpose of this ongoing rally is to bring about the momentum of the Republicans to face a difficult war zone for the November elections.
According to Reuters, that is why the next week's five meetings are intended to "strengthen volunteers and supporters in order to strengthen the majority seats held by the Republicans in the Senate and the House.
"Crime seats are so important to his policy that the president will visit as many states as possible for the busy election season," says a campaign spokesman for the Trump who wants to be anonymous to Reuters.
According to Metro News in West Virginia, tonight's rally scheduled for Wesbancorelina in Vienna could be reported in Pittsburgh's media as a "responsor from Ohio and Pennsylvania."
The game won more than 40 percent of the difference in West Virginia in 2016, but Saturday’s West Virginia visit will be a second visit in a month by Tullet.
The cards are behind the polls, trying to support West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Morris.
According to Reuters, political scholar Simon Haider of the University of West Virginia said that the President's coming to support him is not a good sign for Moriarty.
A rider cup 2018, U.S. winner shows a willingness to fight with hope for a single Sunday.
On Saturday afternoon, after a one-sided three-session match, Forum just needed the rider cup.
The concept of momentum as a pendulum is not based on the concept of sport, but especially in these games, the players really believe in momentum.
(Laughter)
"The opponent had a six point lead, but now it's four points, so I think we're getting a little more excited," says Jordan Sciss when he leaves after a day.
Of course, the European winner has four points left behind, and he's got the upper hand.
As Scissor says, we feel the wind is blowing, and we play together all day, each with three points in four games, plus a number of positive factors.
Scissors, from tea to green, have left their mark.
He and Thomas were led two points after two holes, but as the round went on, the cry of blessing grew, and the decisive Pat sank to the fourth match.
The same male shout he made when he put Pat in 15 holes and won was a statement of his belief that the US selection team has not lost yet.
"I have to focus on my game and do my best," Speece says.
So, this is what we're going to do in the next video.
The 18th Hall will be won.
In the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Freewood have raised more points than Susspuku and Thomas.
These strange but beloved European champions won four victories during four wars without making any mistakes.
They were not only the only pair that didn't hit the boogie during the Saturday afternoon session, but they avoided it in Friday morning, Friday afternoon, and later in Friday morning at nine halls.
As you look at these and the energy flowing between the wild crowds, it is clear that they are athletes who should be defeated on Sunday, and there will be no more popular players than Freewood and Molinari than those who refuse to win the European win in the final battle of Le Golf National.
I want you both to do it in another hall at the same time.
However, the victory has not yet been won.
Baba Watson and Web Sponge won easily the morning Forball heros Sergeo Garcia and Alex Nolen:
Garcia and Lennon, after digging a grave with Boggy and two double-boggys at the front half-nine, couldn't make a round.
Sunday, I don't have anyone to help me.
Forbor and Forsam are very interesting to see close together for each pair of interactions, for advice they don't give you, and for a quick change in strategy.
While European selection has played better as a team here and led a great lead to the final day, this Forum session showed that US selection is particularly willing to fight to eliminate the fears of the US side.
The last day of the rider's cup, European selection at 10-6
European champions are leading at the end of the Forball and Forum match on Saturday, at the U.S. championships at 10-6, and are working well towards the final day of the rider cup.
Tommy Freewood and Francesco Molinari have won two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, and so far they have expanded their scores in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Vion's European selection of the trophy lost in Hazeln two years ago ruled out the United States in the morning's Forball, with a score of 3-1.
The US won two games after winning at Forum, but they couldn't lose the score.
U.S. selection led by Jim Fürik needs to get eight points in a Sunday's singles 12 match to keep the trophy.
Not only did the Freewoods become Europe’s first four-pointer router, but after a sensational weekend, the Freewoods and the Molinari team became the second pair of four-pointed rider cups in the history of the first four games.
After they gave Woods and Patrick Reed in Forbor, they won with a great solidarity and a further score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who was not in a good mood in two games on Saturdays, at times played well, not only at 19 out of 29 games, but also at seven.
Justin Rose, who took a break at Forbor in the morning, joined Henrik Stenson in Fortam, defeated Martin Johnson and Brooks Kepka in 2 and 1st place in the world.
On that day, the Paris-Western course came to be a pleasant day, but the European election did not rule as it pleased.
Three major champions, Jordan Speece and Justin Thomas, raised two points on Saturdays and presented the criteria for US selection.
After they showed up at the Forbor against John Lamu and Ian Pauler in Spain, they lost the first two halls in Fortam, but lost the first two, but they won Paul and Lori MacLeroy at 4&3.
In the history of the rider cup, there have been two single-point flips in the past, but the U.S. selection led by the U.S. is enough to hold the trophy.
But for America's two-day elites, Sunday's fight seems to be beyond their ability.
North Korea says it's impossible to disarm without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the subsequent sanctions against the United Nations have increased the distrust of the United States and that nuclear weapons will not be abandoned under such circumstances.
The foreign minister, Li Yong-ho, told the United Nations annual parliament that in the past year North Korea has taken “an important step of good will”, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and not spreading nuclear and nuclear technology.
"But there is no significant response from the US," he said.
"If we can't trust the United States, our trust in national security will be lost, and we won't be disarmed one way or the other."
His statement is significant in that the North Korean government did not immediately reject one-sided nuclearization, as it had previously been.
At the first summit of the U.S. President and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, Kim Jong-un promised to work for the "unnuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and referred to a joint statement that Trump promised North Korea security:
North Korea wants to end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States says North Korea needs to abandon nuclear weapons first.
The US government also resisted the call to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States claims to be ‘unnuclear first’ and adds pressure by sanctions to achieve its aims, and opposes the ‘end of the war’," he said.
"The perception that sanctions can bend us is an illusion of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions have increased our distrust."
He did not mention the second summit meeting of gold and Trump that President Trump highlighted earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings with the President of Korea during the last five months and added: "If the participants of the non-nuclear issue were not in the United States, the nuclearization of Korea would not have been so close."
But the tone of the speech is dramaticly different from when the gold called the Trump "the president of evil" and said that it was inevitable at last year’s UN General Assembly that North Korean rockets would not reach the US mainland.
Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, praised the UN for its courage to disarm the war, but said it had many challenges and that it needed to maintain its sanctions until North Korea decommissioned.
On Wednesday, Trump said, "I don't care if it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia have argued that the United Nations Security Council should pay North Korea's action.
But on Thursday, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pupeo, said at the United Nations Security Council:
Since 2006, the Security Council has consistently reinforced sanctions against North Korea to block funding for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile development.
Pompeo had a meeting with the UN General Assembly, after which he said he would return next month to visit Miyagi to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit failed.
After leaving Shinji in July, he told me that he had made progress, but within hours, he accused North Korea of making "a gang-like request".
North Korea promised to dismantle missile and nuclear facilities if the United States took "responsive action" at a meeting with the President of the United States this month.
He says money is what he wants: the security that Trump promised in Singapore and the way it works to normalize relations with the US government.
I'm going to give you a few examples.
This year’s new course at Harvard University aims to provide more sleep for all students in order to take in caffeine and fight the spread of the matching culture in "All Night".
The world's greatest Harvard students are often ignorant of very basic things, such as how to use their bodies.
Charles Tsasler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical College, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed this course, he believes it's the first U.S. course of this kind.
He said that he came up with the idea of starting this course after speaking about the effect of sleeplessness on learning.
"I don't know what I'm talking about," she said, "but I don't know what I'm talking about."
"I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm surprised that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep.
This year’s first course explains to students how good sleep habits promote learning and physical ability and improve general Welbeing.
Paul Valera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical College and director of medical services at the university, says that the university has decided to introduce courses after realizing a serious lack of sleep among students that week.
The hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students can learn about the importance of sleep lessons, by clicking on books, the coffee cups, curtains and sneakers in the dorm room, the effects of caffeine and light, sleep deprivation and sleeplessness.
Another section explains how long-term sleep deprivation can contribute to heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer risk:
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily activities.
"I know student behavior will not change immediately.
But they should have the same right to know how the choice of smoking affects health, says Professor Zaisler.
There is a culture that still boasts of studying all night, and says that increasing pressure on modern technology and students increases sleep problems.
Getting a good enough sleep is a “secret weapon” of students fighting stress, fatigue and anxiety, and lack of sleep is a constant hunger for the brain, and he also says to prevent weight gain.
Raymond Thor, 19 years old from California, who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped design his course after his first year at Harvard University.
So, he's going to go to the University of California, and he's going to go to the University of California.
The next step he wants is for all graduate students to get a similar learning program before they start learning in a competitive place called Harvard.
Professor Zaisler recommends setting alarms for students at bedtime just as they get up, and that they be released from electronic screens and LED lighting, and that they be aware of the effects of the "harmful blue light" that causes generality and sleeplessness.
(Music) Rivingston 1-0 Rangers:
The Rangers were also defeated on the Way, by the goal of Dory Menga of Rivingston, that the Rangers in the group of Stephen Gerard were defeated at 1-0.
The Irish Rangers, based in Ibbets, were seeking their first win since the victory of 4-1 in St. Johnston in February.
Menga reached her goal seven minutes before half-time, but after that, she didn't look like the uninspirated Rangers to raise the score.
The Rangers are now in sixth place, but Rivingston has come up third, next to the Hybernian by the score.
Also, the trial's column Spence had to be treated with a head injury and head injury by throwing things from the passengers' seats on the way to the Rangers, which could lead to further difficulties in the Rangers.
Gerard came to the match by changing eight members of the team when he broke through the Air and entered the semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, maintained the same ireban as he did last week when he took the point from Hertz.
The Rangers won at the rate of ownership, but the Rivingston was more effective in less posse.
Just two days after the beginning of Menga, Scott Pittman of MidFidder turned the goal of Alan McGregor's defense and missed a decisive opportunity on the side.
After that, chief Craig Hulkket received a free kick in the Penaltia of Kegan Jacobs, and Deifander's Alan Risgo shot him, but only hit the backpost.
The Rangers ruled the ball, but the finals ended up playing based on wishful thinking rather than with conviction.
The Colombian, Alfred Moreros, claimed penalty after 15 minutes in a collision with Stephen Lores, but the Chief Justice Stephen Thompson rejected the appeal of Morelos.
The Rangers released two front- and-a-half firings, but former Rangers, GK's GK's, did not hesitate to save Rassana Krivari's and Ovie Ejaria's simple shootouts.
The first half-34 minutes of Rivingston was contrary to the game, but no one can deny that it was a gift from hard work.
Again, the Rangers couldn't deal with Jacob's setpiece in the penalty area.
Declan Gallagher passed to Scott Robinson, Robinson calmly sent his pass to Menga, and Menga easily reached the goal, but Scott Arfield couldn't respond.
Gerard replaces Ryan Kent with Krivari at half-time, which soon gives the best results when Winger Krivary passes to Morroth, but Kelly comes forward and blocks the ball with a good shot.
But Rivingston carried the game in its own best game development and exacted the long ball that was sent by the squirrels and the Hulks.
The Holt-led Rivingston had a chance to reach the lead at the end, but Jacobs' shoot was blocked by the Macleger's good rescue, and the squirrel Hedding shoot from the corner of the corner was cut off on the side.
Glen Middleton of the Rangers on the way, offered a penalty when he was involved with Jacobs, and in this case, Thompson rejected it.
Amarak: The inventor of the Geiger counter.
A page of the Sunday Morningk: 1336 years ago, on September 30, 1882, a future physicist, John Vilheim, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radiation that is eventually known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger Counter, the chief force of science, has been the main force of pop culture so as to be seen in the 1950 film The Collonado Bell, which was featured in the film Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, dressed as an unlikely cowboy scientist.
(Laughter)
It's a Geiger counter that's used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you tie up an earphone, you can actually hear the effect of the atoms released by the radiation in the minerals."
(Laughter)
Hans Geiger died just a few days before his 63th birthday in 1945.
But the invention that gave his name continues to live.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to separate cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "discern" and kill.
And that's what we're going to do.
We're going to use this method to extract immune cells from patients and to change them in the lab.
This allows cells to separate proteins common to many cancers and re-inject them.
The test vaccine shows promising results among cancer patients across a wide range.
In the case of a woman who was given a vaccine to tell her to recognize a defective cell in the immune system, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this way, when you extract immune cells from the patient and you change them in the laboratory, you can "discern" the proteins common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject this cell.
Professor Jay Verzoski, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said:
HER2 promotes the growth of several species of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer, explains Professor Verzosky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "telling them how to target cancer cells" has also been effective in treating leukemia.
Canier West used SNL to carry magacaps to support the torch.
That's the bad news.
Canier West went on boom in 2020 after spreading support for President Donald Trump in the studio during the Saturday Night Live.
West sang "The Ghost Town" on the third song of the night, "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) with the "Maga" cap, and then spoke out against the Democrats and continued to support the Trump.
"I talked to a white man and he said, "How can I like Trump, he's racist?"
"But if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago."
SNL began that day with a sketch of the Hollywood star, Matt Damon, who testified to the Senate Justice Committee's testimony against the charge of sexual assault by Christine Breasey Ford:
West rumors were not aired, but they were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Locke.
Whether Lock tried to laugh at West with his post is unknown.
West also complained to the audience that he was struggling behind the scenes for his hat.
They attacked me on the backstage.
They say, "Don't go outside with your hat on."
I'm really being bullied!
And he says, "I'm at the bottom."
West says, "Do you want to see the bottom of the bottom?" and continues, "I'm wearing Superman's cape, and no one can tell me what to do.
Then let's try love."
"I'm not sure," said the manager, "but I'll tell you what," he said, "that at least two booms in his comment, and that the SNL actors seemed to be confused, and one of them reported that the whole studio was quieted.
West was invited to replace his former rapper, Mack Miller, who died a few days ago by singer Ariana Grande.
West dressed up in a paint bottle and sang "I Love It" to confuse many.
The leader of the conservative group, Candace Turner, tweeted in support of West: "Thank you for the bravest spirit: the mob."
But Karen Hunter, host of the talk show, tweeted that West is simply " them and very wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward the people who spread harmful ideologies in my community (by buying his music and clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
And we added.
Before this show, the rapper announced that he had changed his name on Twitter, and now he says, "He's officially known as Canier West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, but follows the footsteps of Dedi, also known as Pafda, Puffy and Pdi.
My fellow rapper, Snoop Dog is also named Snoop Lion, and, of course, the late prince of music, after he changed his name to a symbol, then he renamed him "An artist who was once known as a prince."
I was charged with attempted murder at the Belfast restaurant.
A man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday, and a 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder.
Police report this happened in Barry Hadcamore.
On Monday, the defendant will appear before the Belfast Court.
The charges will be examined by the D.A.
The Star of the Roars, Kit Harrington, attacked a toxic man.
Kit Harrington is known as the sword's best John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series.
However, Kit, 31 years old, attacked such a match hero’s stereo type and said that this role on the screen makes the boys feel strong enough to be picked up from around them.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times culture, Kit said he felt that something was wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic manliness in #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, 31 years old, from the game of Roones, admitted to feeling "very strong" about dealing with the problem.
"We feel very personally very strongly now, no matter how wrong we are in regard to manliness," he said.
"What have you taught the growing boys about the issues we're looking at?"
Thanks to a very manly character, Kit believes that television may share part of the blame for the increase in toxic manliness.
He continues: "What is born, what is taught?"
Do they not feel that they must be men with certain qualities because of what they saw on TV and on the streets?
I think this is one of the big problems of our times, but how do we change this?
"It's obvious that something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also said, “The battle and the horse are done,” and admitted that the game of Rosones was over next summer and that he wouldn’t write about its introductions or its series.
Since November, Sam Shepard's "Tru West" re-runs the story of his brother, a film producer and a thief.
He claims the best thing he's ever done is meet his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, and in that way he gave me a future family and a future life."
Rose played John Snow's girlfriend Igrit, who played the kit in this fantasy series that won Amy's award.
They were held in June 2018 at a home in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AlDS: Report of a sharp 14% increase in new diseases in China
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
Health authorities say that more than 82 million people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported just in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, and we see changes from the past.
In the Middle East, HIV spread rapidly as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero in this way, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in Taninan.
In China, however, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 a year.
In the LGBT community in China, sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem.
While homosexuality has been legalized in China in 1997, it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is increasing.
The study estimates that 70 to 90 percent of male homosexuals will eventually marry women due to conservative national values.
Many of the infections occur because of lack of precautions in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide broad access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its approach to the issue.
Maxine Waters, denial of Republican data leaks by staff, accused of "dangerous lies" and "conspiratory conspiracy theories".
Senator Maxine Waters denied the charge that on Saturday one of her staff had posted three Republicans' identities on their Wikipedia page:
The Los Angeles Democratic Party claims that the claim is carried out by critics and websites of the “superright wing.”
"A lie, a lie, a mean lie," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
Information was reported to include the home address and phone number of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham and the United States elected Mike Lee and Orin Hutch.
This information was posted online by an anonymous person in Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on the alleged sexual assault of the Supreme Court candidate, Bret Caverneau.
This leak occurred after three senators interrogated Kabano.
The newspaper The Hill reports that conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstate, whose IP address is supposed to belong to Waters' office, have published information about the water's employees.
"This unconfirmed claim is a complete lie, absolutely a lie," Waters continued.
"My staff is not involved in the leaking of this information, even though this is a violation of their identity, identity and safety due to false claims.
This baseless claim is a complete lie, absolutely a lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online by people, including former White House reporter Ali Fleisher.
"This denial is only anger," Frysher wrote.
"This shows that she is not worthy of the senator.
If you are accused of not doing what you did, don't be angry.
Don't be arrogant.
Don't ask questions about the defendant's motives.
You have to be calm and calm."
Frysher seems to compare the criticism of Democrats and the reaction of Waters, who said Judge Kabano was too angry about his behavior at the hearing on Thursday.
Oma Navarro, a candidate for the Waters seats in the middle elections, expressed his thoughts on Twitter:
"If it's true, it's great."
In her statement, Waters says her office has contacted the jurisdictional authorities and the police about these claims.
She says, "We will do everything we can to find the killer," and says:
"Johnny English, Anallog's Backfire" film review, a weak-powered spy parody.
Recently, it is decided to find a way to find the meaning of Bregit in a new film depicting the decline of Britain, which seems to apply to Johnny English's continuous action comedy.
Can this ironic self-stage of satire on how helpless we are become a new export opportunity in Britain?
In any case, Johnny English, with his eyes wide open and his face like a rubbery face, repeats his failure in this work, suggesting that his name is more than anything else that he is a comedy created for other movie lovers outside the English language.
He, of course, is a foolish secret agent who misjudges himself for his sophisticated charms, but he has all the elements of the character who played only the sound of a burning runner song at the opening of the London Olympics in 2012.
Johnny English was originally based on a world traveler whose role was played by Atkinson on a now forgotten Berkeley-card TV advertisement.
This latest piece has one or two good scenes.
As Johnny English comes up to the helicopter with medieval armor, the Lotter Blade will make a sound at the helmet.
Although atkinson’s body is also gifted with comedy, the humor is quite weak and unnecessary, especially when it comes to the fact that "intense" films such as 007 and Mission Inposible include the elements of comedy.
His humor seems to be like a child's not an adult, and to me Johnny English's bizarre adventure is not as original and not as focused as the gambling of the silent movie at Atkinson.
The film is based on the current permanent topic of serious problems in Britain.
Our agent, unfortunately little role in Kevin Elton, is being disturbed by a cyber hacker entering the British secret web network and revealing the identity of all British agents in action.
The news has gone beyond the limit for a prominent Prime Minister who has already had many problems and has lost support.
Her wise adviser said that since the identity of all current operatives has been published, the only way is to summon retired spies.
So Johnny English, who works as the principal of an elegant school and is taught how to be a secret agent, is also heard.
English will head for the White Hall for a quick briefing and meet with his former partner, Ben Miller, who has been struggling for many years.
Boff is now married and married to a submarine commander (not too good for Vicki Pepperdain).
And the queen's secret service's squabble will be restored to meet the beautiful Fem Fat, Ofiria Britova, acting as Orga Cullenco.
On the other hand, Prime Minister Jayson Volta, a charismatic billionaire who claims to solve the plight of British computers, is free to say:
English and Bouff have caused a lot of trouble as they used to, when they used to wear waiters and set on fire in luxury French restaurants, made a fuss to break into a luxury yacht in Volta, and tried to use virtual reality headset to find out what was inside Volta's house.
It is true that all the devices are gathered at the last mountain range, but this beloved comedy is generally like a child show.
It's quite common.
And as other Johnny English movies felt, the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a suitable role for his talents.
The Labor Party denied that they were considering a plan to earn a five-day salary for their citizens four days a week.
Jeremy Cobin's Labor Party seems to consider a Latheical plan that the people will be paid five days a week for four days of work.
The party believes that corporate management wants to share the funds received through the artificial intelligence revolution with workers by increasing their salary.
It is estimated that employees will work three days a week in the same salary.
Information sources said the idea is in line with the party's economic policy and plans to bring the country to the advantage of the workers.
The transition to the 4th day of the week is received by the Labor Union Council as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
In The Sunday Times, the union leaders said: "The policy review will be announced by the end of the year.
"Not overnight, but four days a week, the labor system is the goal of the party's approach to re-calibrating the economy to the advantage of the workers and of the party's overall industrial strategy."
Since the Green Party has pledged four days a week to work during the 2017 election campaign, the Labor Party does not support the idea for the first time.
At present, however, the entire working party is not supporting its goals.
A spokesman for the Labor Party said: "The 4-day workweek is not the party's policy, and the party has not considered it."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell transformed his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy last week at the labor conference.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the "faceless officer" of a public service firm and from the "unjustable".
The plan of the shadow minister also means that the government of the Labor Party will be able to "extend" corruption and that the current stockholders of the water company may not be able to recover all their resources.
He also sent workers to the corporate board and established a comprehensive ownership fund and placed 10% of the private sector's equity there.
Lindsey Gram and John Kennedy tell "60 Mintz" about whether the FBI might change their minds in their investigation of the Kavano.
An investigation by the FBI regarding Judge Brett Kabano's charges postponed the final vote on the appointment of the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question that the investigation would endanger the support of the Republican senators.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, “60 Mintz” correspondent Scott Perry asked Republican Senators Lyndsey Gram and John Kennedy if they could discover something that the FBI would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than Gram, a colleague of South Carolina.
"Of course." Kennedy said.
I told him I'd be in the hearing.
I mean, after the charges, I called him, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined and clear."
But the Gram's vote seems impossible to change.
"I'm determined about Brett Kabano, and it's going to get a lot of criticism."
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I do know that Brett was very negative.
"And no one named her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new changes.
What's the Global Citizen Festival?
On Saturday, New York will host the annual musical event, Global City Festival, where many of the most impressive stars perform, and what is equally impressive is their mission to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citysun Festival, the seventh year of this year, will attract tens of thousands not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, CardiB, Sean Mendez and others, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event’s end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Rights Association, a global community dedicated to ending poverty by increasing the number of active fighters.
In order to get free tickets for the event (if you want to buy a VIP ticket), the participants had to complete a series of meaningful tasks, or "actions", that raise awareness of volunteers, e-mails, phone calls, and other purposes of ending poverty.
But after 12 years, how long has the Global Citizens Festival achieved its goal?
Is the idea of trying to convince people to call for action, a free concert, or another case of "clickism," an online petition or a tweet, only makes them feel like they're doing something meaningful?
Since 2011, Global Citizens has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of supporters and says they are promoting various goals.
This action has caused world leaders to announce more than 3.7 billion commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 22.5 billion people by the year 2030.
In the early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, of which at least 10 billion were already paid or funded.
The group estimates that the collected funds have thus far directly affected about 649 million people around the world.
The primary commitment is to "help children grow to their full potential" and includes power-outism, a partnership between British-based investors and organizers, which promise to receive more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens and to provide 35 million dollars for Rwanda and help to eliminate malnutrition from the country.
"With the support of the British government, donors, governments, and the like of you, the social injustice of malnutrition can be replaced by the social injustice of lack of nutrition. "The Power Obstetrics Ambassador, Tracy Ulman, spoke to the audience during live concerts in London in April 2018.
The group also said that more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mother and child have taken place, and the government has announced funding for a project that provides nutrition for 5 million women and children, Power Obstetrics.
"Do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"The long and difficult path will sometimes fail."
But since we have power when we gather together, we will succeed like the great civil rights and the anti-patritism movement.

The U.S. can use the Navy to prevent Russian energy exports.
The U.S. government has revealed that the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Jink, can turn to the Navy in areas including the Middle East if necessary to prevent Russian energy from hitting the market.
Jink claimed that his involvement in Russia’s Syria is an excuse for the development of a new energy market, especially if he works in a legal government invitation.
“The reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to communicate with energy like they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,” it was reported.
According to the officials, there's a way and a way to work on it.
"The US, along with the Navy, is able to ensure that Sea Lane is open, and to seal off energy from the market if necessary," he said.
Jink was speaking to the attenders of the event hosted by Consuer Energy Alliance, a non-profit building up as an energy consumer in the United States:
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran to the fact that both companies are virtually the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use fuel instead,” he said, and called Russia an economic-based "one-to-one-to-peer" (a horse with only one sport).
The statement was made while the government of playing cards was commissioned to promote the export of liquid gas to Europe as a much cheaper option for European consumers instead of Russia.
That's why the Trump administration is trying to convince Germany to get out of the "uncorrected Nord Stream 2 pipeline plan, including President Trump himself.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the 1.1 billion-dollar Northstream pipeline, which will double its existing pipeline capacity to 11 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project was simply due to economic reasons and is an example of an unfair competition.
"We believe that energy cannot be a tool to pressure, and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The U.S. Stans has provoked a German backlash, and Germany has re-confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Union of Industry (BDI) has called on the United States not to speak to EU energy policy and the two-party agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem for the Third World to interfere with our energy supply," Dieter Kemp, president of the German Industrial Union, followed a recent meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "softly researching the 2020 presidential elections," as the Massachusetts Senator says.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday, "I'm going to look into the post-middle presidential elections."
At the city hall in York, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidates.
Mr. Hill said, "It's time for a woman to enter Washington and rebuild a broken government, including a woman to take the lead."
"I'm going to look into the presidential elections in detail after the 6th of June."
Warren joined the debate about President Donald Trump during the Town Hall, who said, "He led the country in the wrong direction."
“I’m really worried about Donald Trump’s work on democracy,” she said.
Warren has made bitter criticism of Mr. Trump and the candidate for the Supreme Court Judge, Bret Kavano:
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that more than half of Warren’s own districts did not think she would run for office in 2020.
According to the Safof University’s Political Research Center / Boston Grove Survey, 58 percent of Massachusetts's "responsible" voters said that the senator should not be elected.
Thirty-three percent supported the election.
In a poll, more than 38% supported the potential of the former governor, Deval Patrick.
The names of other prominent Democrats who discussed the potential of running in 2020 are former vice president Joe Byden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to an Associated Press report, Byden has officially decided by January.
Sarah Palin referred to Paris' PTSD at Donald Trump's rally.
Twenty-six-year-old truck Parisan spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested on Monday night for the domestic violence.
"What his son is going through when he comes home, I share with other families that feel the negative effects of PTSD and the injuries that soldiers are suffering at the time of his return," she told the audience at the rally of Donald Trump in Tarza, Okrahoma.
"I'll be glad to see you, sir," he said, "that Paris calls his arrest "an elephant in the room," and says to his son and other war veterans, "they'll change a little bit.
According to the spokesman for the Isla police station Dan Bennett, he was arrested on Monday in Yulra, Alaska, for disrupting reports of domestic violence and drunkenness and was charged with domestic violence against women.
18 states and Washington D.C. support the challenge against the new refugee policy.
18 states and the Colombian Districts are supporting the legal objection to the US's new policy of denying asylum of victims from gangs and domestic violence.
According to the NBC News, representatives from 18 states and special districts filed a court advice report in Washington Friday and supported the protest against the policy of refugees.
Grace, the session suit was proposed in August by the United States Civil Freedoms Union, but the plaintiff's full name has not been revealed.
She said her partner and "his violent gang members" abused her, but the US authorities refused to apply for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorney who supports Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are facing a widespread problem of gangs and domestic violence, with a large number of asylum requests in the United States.
The new U.S. refugee policy reversed the 2014 immigration appeal council's decision to allow immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum without a document.
In a Friday statement, Columbia District Attorney General Carl Racine said that the new policy "disregards the state law which lasted decades, federal law and international law".
"The federal law requires that every refugee bill be ruled based on certain facts and circumstances of the bill, and such a hurdle violates its principles," says a court adviser's report.
In his report, he further suggests that the policy of refusing to enter the country will harm the U.S. economy, while migrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “to supply the necessary labor force.”
In June, the Attorney General General, Jeff Sessions, ordered the immigration agent no longer to provide protection to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
"Estitution is available to those who leave their country for racial, religious, national, or political persecution or fear of certain social groups," said the session in a June 11 policy release.
The asylum was not intended to reduce all the problems facing the world every day, not even all the serious ones.
In the battle of discovery of survivors, the death toll was doubled by the desperate rescue of the pulp.
For the survivors, the situation was even worse.
“It’s like you’re very nervous,” her 35-year-old mother, Lisa Cumma, kissed a hot baby boy in a burnt-out Par shelter.
"Ambulance comes every minute or so.
There's very little clean water."
Back in the house that was destroyed, we found what we had, and we saw the people trying to save anything we found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were packed with people.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris in the hip and shoulders, were resting outside Paul's Army Hospital, where the patient was treated outside because of the strong aftershocks.
When I remembered when the fifth floor room of the hotel where my wife and daughter were shaken by a violent earthquake, I saw tears in his eyes.
I didn't have time to run.
I think I've been stuck in a broken wall, and Harris told an Associated Press report that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then I couldn't hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope you're all right.
America's ambassador, blamed "bullying" using "adverts" in China.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement on the mutual interest of American trade in the middle of the country, the Chinese ambassador accused Beijing of using American newspapers for propaganda:
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, denied it last Wednesday, condemned China for trying to interfere with the US parliament elections on November 6, and then referred to the cash ads of the China Daily newspaper, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, Demony Register.
Trump's criticism of Beijing's attempt to interfere with the US elections indicates that Washington's campaign to pressure China has become a new phase, as the US authorities told Reuters:
Trade promotions are normal for foreign governments, but Beijing and Washington are currently in the midst of a growing trade war that imposes a equal tariff on each other’s imports.
China's early trade-war justice tax was designed to strike exporters in states like Iowa, who supported Republicans at the Trump rate, and China and the U.S. experts said:
Terry Branstad, China's American ambassador and former governor of the state of Iowa, a major exporter of produce to China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
"The invasion of propaganda propaganda against our freedom of press is increasing," wrote Brandstad in the comments of demonstrators on Sunday.
According to Brand, "the Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of speech and publishing for its own benefit by publishing a pay-off statement to Demoin Register to spread propaganda."
“In contrast, we can’t see only limited opposition here on the Beijing road, and we can’t really reflect the different opinions Chinese people have about China’s crowded economic orbit.
"One of the most prominent newspapers in China has avoided publishing my articles," he added.
Anatomist warns that the scandal against Babaner will lead to the separation of women voters before the middle elections.
In response to the testimony of multiple sexual violence, many Republican top members are defending the candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Bret Kabour, who warns that the Republicans will face opposition from women in the next half of the election.
Most Republicans are already hoping to move on to vote.
In an article published on Saturday in The Hill, Professor Grant Lehler of the political sciences at the University of Laquest said:
Professor Lehler said that Senator Jeff Frecke (the Republican candidate for Arizona) had promoted the FBI investigations at Gili to suspect that it was enough to calm the voters' anger.
According to a Washington, D.C. newspaper, Kaylene Jean Pierre, a senior adviser for the progressive group Mubon, and National Spokane, said: "The women will not forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget it until November.
In spite of the testimony of the Republican leader of the Judicial Committee on Friday morning, Dr. Christine Bralely Ford, the protesters in front of the Senate were shouting, "November is coming!"
Political analysts outside the party, Stu Rosenberg, told the news website, "The zeal and motivation of the Democrats will be incalculable."
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
But it can also be even higher, especially women voting in urban non-partners and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who have no good opinion of the president but the vote rate is generally low."
In front of the public testimony that Ford had been sexually assaulted by the Supreme Court's appointee, analysts suggest that if the Republicans go forward with their approval, there will be a reaction.
According to the NBC News, former president of the Republican National Assembly, Michael Suite, said last week that “the disturbance has caused a lot of confusion in the GOP.”
"The issue is not just the voting of the committee or the final vote of Kasabah to be appointed, but the way Republicans deal with the turmoil and how they treat her."
However, the American people are divided by whether they should believe in Ford or Kabour's testimony, which seems to be the majority of the rest.
According to Ugava's poll, while 41% said that they believe Ford's testimony is absolutely true/ maybe 35%, he said:
In addition, 38 percent of the people said that he was a witness and that he was probably a liar, and that Ford was 30 percent.
With the backing of Freck, the FBI has begun investigating Ford's testimony and the testimony of the other accuser, Devola Ramiretz, reports the Guardian.
Last week, when he was 17 years old, Ford testified under oath that he was attacked by a drunk Mr. Banner.
Ramiretz also testified that the designated judge of the Supreme Court had exposed his genitals during the 1980s when he attended Yale University.
Plan to launch a new Internet instead of the inventors of the World Wide Web, Google or Facebook.
Tim Berners Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has set up a startup to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project by Regendo Lee, a tech world's leverager, and is based on Bernard Lee's open-source platform, Solid.
Sord gives users a choice: where the data is stored and who has access to it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast, Berners Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was to "govern the world":
So, we're going to talk about startups.
This is a historic moment.
This app allows us to use Solid technology to create our own personal online data store (POD).
This includes contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
We'll be able to use this as an example of Google Draw, Microsoft Outlook, Black, Spatify.
The unique point of the personal online data store is that it's entirely up to the user who can access the information.
It's called "the individual empowerment through the data."
According to Inrupt's CEO, John Bruce, his idea is to provide resources, processes and proper skills so that everyone can access Solid.
Inrupt is currently made up of developers of on-site employees who have been bought by Berners Lee, Bruce, IBM, and a volunteer community.
From this week on, technology developers around the world will be able to use the tools available on the Inrupt website to create their own dispersal app.
Berners Lee says that he and his team are talking about introducing a complete change in the business model of Facebook and Google in one night.
"I'm not asking their permission."
In a media release on Saturday, Bernards Lee said about Inrupt, "The mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem systems to ensure the integration and quality of the new web built on Solid."
Bernards Lee, who founded the World Wide Web Conscientation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994, brought about a change in the Internet.
Berners Lee has been making powerful comments in the online debates over the past few months.
Berners Lee maintains the position of founder and director of the World Wide Web Conscientious, Web Foundation, Open Data Institute, even while Inrupt is being launched.
"I am very optimistic about the next generation's web," Bernards Lee added.
(Applause)
A celebration was held in my hometown of 100 years ago in connection with the only Church of England priest who won the Victoria Cross during World War I.
Minister Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1818, by the Battle of Bernly's and LuoCool.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper and never saw him glorify the highest honor of the British army.
On Saturday, a parade took place in Lachden, Northumbershire, and the monument was published by his two grandchildren.
Michael Van, one of his grandsons, said that "about the Stone, it's the greatest Simbolic."
According to the London Gates, on September 29, 1818, Commander Van led his troops through the thick fog of Canal de San Cantan and the fire of front and machine guns.
Then, with great courage to the front of the fire, they rushed in one hand with their small guns, pushed back the front, and drove away three troops.
Commander Van was killed on October 4, 1818 by a German sniper just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says, "I can't imitate my grandfather's behavior, but it's also humiliating."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, held a big celebration after a parade led by the Blintwood Royal Youth Band.
Michael Van said, "I felt a great honor to be in the parade," and added, "The courage of a true hero has been demonstrated by the support of many."
(Laughter)
And I want you to imagine how I felt when I couldn't see this main event, even though I spent the whole night looking at Bellar 206.
The building of San Jose was a 13-year-old war.
At 6:00 a.m., the broadcast turned into a Peppa pig while Gegar Mussi and Lori McDonald were preparing for the match.
For this fight, viewers who stayed awake till early in the morning were especially disappointed.
One fan posted on Twitter, “It’s some kind of bad joke” about what happened on children’s shows.
When asked about the broadcast, Veratour's senior vice president marketing and communications director Dave Schwartz replied: "It's 6 a.m. the government's regulation that martial arts aren't good for hearing, and it seems that we have to switch to children's programs."
"Pupupta pig is a good fit."
The president of Veratour, Scott Cocker, says that in the future, he will consider a schedule for British viewers:
"I think it'll be okay by the time we rerun."
"But it was 6 a.m. Sunday morning, so I couldn't adjust by Sunday and Monday in England.
We're in the process of adjusting.
So, when the broadcasts went off, there was a lot of text going on.
I tried to put it back together and put it back together.
But that wasn't the case.
I'm going to show you a few examples.
I'm going to try to reduce it from six to five, from six to five, and I'm going to give you a lot of games to be a fan.
This was an unfortunate situation."
Dessert Island disc: Tom Dale, I felt "equality" about sexuality
The Olympic divers, Tom Daley, grew up feeling inferior to him in terms of sexuality, and that was the motivation that led to success.
The 24-year-old Dalley didn't realize he wasn't like the kids around him until he went to middle school.
Lauren Lavin spoke on the radio 4 Dessert Island disc, where he is presenter, about gays to give hope to others.
He also said that being a parent has made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter for this long holiday show, hasn't been in attendance for months because of his illness.
In his first show, Raburn showed up as castaway and said that he felt that he was "been inferior to them both because it was not socially acceptable to be in love with boys and girls."
He says: "To this day, our sense of equality and dissonance has always remained real, giving us the strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove to himself that he was worth something.
Two Olympic bronze medalists, Dare, became one of the most influential LGBT campaigns in Australia during this year's Commonwealth competition and appealed to more countries to legalize homosexuality.
Darer says he is lucky to be able to live a life with his sexuality open and free, and he decided to speak up to give hope to others.
Three world champions, Dare told him that they fell in love with American filmmaker and male man, Dustin Lance Black, "it seemed like a surprise."
Dalley married Mr. Black, who won the Oscar Prize in his 20-year-old year.
"I've been through a lot since I was very young," he says, "the Dareer entered the Olympics for the first time at 14 years of age, and three years later, he lost his father to cancer.
This couple became parents in June, and his son is Robert Ray Black-Daily, and he says, "All values have changed since the birth of his son."
"If you had been asked about this last year, you would have said it was all about getting a gold medal."
"But there's something more important than the Olympic gold medal."
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
My son was diagnosed as a brain tumor and inherited Robert's name from his father, Robert, who died in 2011.
One of the last words Father left was that he had already arranged tickets to the 2012 London convention.
"By the time you're in the front row, there's no one in the world anymore.
"I held my hand until my father stopped breathing, and when he died, I realized he wasn't invincible."
The following year, Dalai Lama joined the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"Then I thought this was all I wanted in my life.
The experience also inspired me to think of Heather Small's "Proud" as a combination of the growth process on his way to the Olympics.
Desert Island Disk, BBC Radio 4, Sunday English Time 11:15
(Laughter)
America's Phil Michaelson is trying to set up a new record in the 47th race against the rider cup on Sunday, but we need to review the form so that this does not turn out to be an unhappy outcome.
In this two-year event, Michaelson, who is trying to record the 12 most popular events, was ordered by Captain Jim Fürik to enter the bench for Forbor and Forum on Saturday.
Miquelson, who has won five major championships, has been featured in many American events, this time in a contest to step aside from the role and participate in support.
The 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal condition to challenge the Le Golf National Course.
The course itself is harsh, but on Sunday's ninth match, Francesco Molinari is going to compete with British-open champions, who teamed up with Luki, Tommy Freetwood, to win in all four games this week.
If the United States starts 12 single matches with 4 points down, it will be a hot match from the beginning, and the Michaelson game will be truly decisive.
Mr. Furik has placed his trust in Michaelson, but did not say much.
"He fully understands the role I have to play today, and he says I'm ready for tomorrow with a light fist on my back and a shoulder on my shoulder," Furik says.
"I think you have full confidence.
He's a player in the hall, and he's been making a lot of contributions to the team in the past.
I never imagined he'd play two games.
I thought I'd play a lot more, but now I'm going to make this adjustment.
He wants more, as everyone else thinks."
The Michaelson player will have to record the maximum number of rider cups match on Sundays, without the record of Nick Fald.
This could end the career of Michaelson's rider cup.
However, Furik says that his presence is based on his team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, and he loves to mess with people, and he's grateful to be in the teamroom."
"I think young players enjoy working with him this week.
He brings more than play."
(Applause)
From his experience, European captain Thomas Viyon realizes that the situation can be reversed, even if he is leading a major lead at the start of a single rider cup on the last day.
Billon, from Denmark, made his debut in Valderama in 1997, when a team led by Sebe Valesteros was leading a five-point lead against the United States, and the result was that he managed to win in the slightest difference of 141 .012-131.122 .
Remember that the team in Le Golf National won 5-3 on Friday, 2018, and after watching them lead at 10-6 yesterday, they were leading a huge lead in Valderama.
So, this is what I'm going to show you.
So I'll do everything I can tomorrow.
We're going to do what we have to do.
We're not done with the game until we see the score.
We have a goal, which is to win the trophy.
I've been telling you this for a long time, I've been passionate about 12 players on my team, but I know what they're dealing with.
He adds: "I'm never going to be proud of my team's performance in a high-level golf course.
We have enemies tomorrow.
We're going to do a lot of work in this class.
It's great to be able to be with fellows in good times, but in personal combat, all of our qualities as golfers are tested.
We have to send this message to all the players and tomorrow we have to do our best.
This time you need to get away from your people.
In contrast to Billon, Jim Fürik aims to see his coach as an individual over the team, except for Jordan Sciss and Justin Thomas, who have three points out of four points:
Furik himself took both sides in the outcome of the fateful day.
The 1999 captain, Ben Krenshaw, was asked about the time when he gathered the players together for the final day.
"Tomorrow there will be 12 important matches, but it will be expected that the rapid expansion will begin as we saw in Brookline and Medina.
So let's see if we can do that.
We've chosen people according to intuition, to fit the situation.
Thomas is in charge, and the top match is against Lori McLeroy, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Lamu, Tommy Freewood, Ian Poulter.
"I'm putting players in this order because I think I can get through the whole thing."
Germany's new military, also postponed.
Local media reported that the German Navy was planning to replace the currently degenerating Cold War warship with the latest frigate ship in 2014, but that it was not realized until next year at least, due to its growing cost to the system.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, a spokesman for the military, the launch of the latest frigate ship in the Verden Vürtenberg has been extended to half the year 2019.
The battleship was supposed to be introduced in 2014, but the trouble of the post-invasion was still there, and the ambitious plan went a long way.
The Baden Vürtenberg class frigate, ordered by the Navy in 2007, is now being used by the military to replace the Bremen class frigate.
Barden Vürtenberg class frigate is characterized by the introduction of some of the stealth technology, such as the powerful cannons, antiaircrafts, and antiship missiles, as well as low-duty radar, infrared signatures, sound signatures, and so on.
Other important features are the long maintenance cycle, which allows them to send the frigate to a place away from their mother's port for up to two years.
However, the newspaper Die Zeit points out that the latest warships that were supposed to play an important role in Japan's military forces towards the country will actually be obsolete by the time they begin to be used.
The F125 frigate, which continued its troubles, became a big news last year when the German Navy officially refused to launch and returned it to Brom Unt Fors in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the warship to the ship maker.
Although we do not know the exact cause behind the return, German media have quoted information that has shown that the warship has seen multiple serious “genuine and structural flaws” that would make it inappropriate for a warship to perform a battle mission.
The Barden Vürtenberg class frigate was piloted by about 120 marines, half of the men needed for a generation ago in the Bremen class.
Also, the Verden Vürtenberg class frigate is so heavy that the performance is reduced, and the future upgrades are limited by the Navy.
The weight of this 7,000-ton "Linland Faltz" is double the weight of a fellow ship that Germany used in World War II.
The total cost of the project, including the training of crew members, is also a problem as well as structural flaws.
The total cost of the project is estimated to have increased from the first 22/twenty-two euros to the present 31 .
The recent threat to the power of the German Navy has made the issue of the latest frigate is very important.
In the beginning of this year, Hans Peter Bertels, head of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy is actually missing a warship with enough Capa City to put it in place.
He said that the use of old warships has been stopped and there are no other warships, so the problem has increased in time.
He also expressed regret over the fact that the Barden Vürtenberg class Frygate was never introduced into the Navy.
Nationaltrast, we're about to find out what the bat is.
A new study in the high ground of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the terrain when they prey on them.
The study is expected to bring new information about the behavior of this unique flying mammal and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by National Trust for Scotland researchers, will track the species of bats, sopranopicre, Brown Dongder, Dobnton and other species at the Inverwe Gardens in Webster's Island.
Set up a special recorder at the main points of the property and track bat activity through the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile-causing investigations using mobile detectors.
All recorded sounds are analyzed by experts, and in addition to the frequency of calls made by bats, they reveal what species they are doing.
Based on analysis, maps and reports of habitats will be produced, and the behavior of bats will be painted in detail according to the terrain.
Robb Duwar Conservation Advisor for NTS hopes research will reveal where the most important habitat for bats is and how these habitats are used by different species.
This information can be used to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as how to establish habitats for bats and related species and how to preserve them.
The number of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has dropped significantly over the past 100 years.
Bats are in danger of extinction because of construction and habitat loss that affect the situation of dead trees.
In addition to chemical processing of insect paper and building materials, pet attacks by cats and windmills and lighting also pose a risk for bats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But bats have a habit of being more sensitive to hearing when feeding at night than when seeing.
Bats use their developed echolocation ability to catch insects at pinpoints and recognize obstacles in flight routes.
NTS, which manages 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and more than 77,000 hectares of assets in the country, is very serious with bats.
NTS has 10 experts who regularly conduct research, test bats trees, and sometimes protect bats.
NTS also has the first bat-only reserve in Scotland at the Sleep of Dam Flies and Garroway, where 8 out of 10 species of bats live in Scotland.
David Thompson, who manages the Estates, considers the environment ideal for bats:
"This is the best place for bats," he says.
"There's an old building here, there's a lot of old trees, all of which are part of a habitat suitable for bats.
But there's so much that bats still don't know, that activity here and elsewhere can help us understand what it takes to breed bats."
He believes that if a bat accidentally destroys a single tree in which a bat breeds, it will kill up to 400 female and young bats, which could lead to the extinction of the bats in the land, it is important to check the bats before they do conservation work in the land.
Bats are a protected animal, and it is illegal to kill, abuse, interfere, or cut down trees.
Elizabeth Ferrell, director of the Scotland Branch Committee for the Bat Protection Trust, calls for support from local people:
He said, "There's still much to learn about the Scottish bat, and I really don't know how it works."
A lawyer is prepared to deny the charges of Lonado rape and sue for the magazine itself.
Christiano Lonado denies the charge of rape directed to him as "a lie" and tries to use his name to "just to promote themselves".
Lonado's lawyer is preparing to file a lawsuit against the German weekly magazine Deia Schpygel, which published this suspicion.
The Portuguese advance player in Euventos is accused of raping an American woman named Cassin Mayorga in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
Lonado also suspected that he would hand her 375,000 dollars and ask for an order to do something that had never happened to her, reported Deah Schpygel on Friday.
A few hours after this report was reported, 33-year-old Lonado, via an Instagram live video, called the report "Fik News" to 142 million followers.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
"What the magazine reported today is feic news," said Lonado, who won Barador five times in the past, to the camera.
"It wants to promote itself using my name.
It's a common thing.
You want to give my name to your magazine, and that's what they do.
"I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine."
According to Reuters, Lonado's lawyers are preparing to sue Deah Schpygel for this suspicion and criticize the magazine as being “exposed to report the possibility of a private space”.
According to Christian Schultz, Lonado is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years to be charged with “a minimum of compensation” for serious violations.
The spiraling incident was reported to have occurred in 2009 at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas and in a suite at the casino.
According to a document submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Lonado and Marjoga went to his room after meeting at the nightclub where Lonado raped his anus.
Marjoruga kneels after the incident and says he is a "99% good person" and says he has been distracted by the bad part of "1%".
According to the document, Lonado admitted that he had sexual relations with the two but agreed to it.
Marjoruga also went to the police and claimed to have the picture taken at the hospital, but later he felt "fear of retribution" and agreed to a settlement outside the court because he was afraid of being "openly humiliated".
Today, 34-year-old Marjoruga is calling for abdication of reconciliation because of the ongoing trauma of a suspected case.
Lonado was on his way from Manchester United to Red Madrid at the time of the incident, and this summer he was transferred to Yuventos, Italy's strongest.
"The British will regret losing their auto industry forever."
Greg Clark, the minister of business, said that Britain will regret losing its position as a car manufacturer to win the world's war.
The minister also added that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, "I'm worried that the production of Barnaston's factory will be suspended."
Clark, the minister of business said we need an agreement.
Japan's car manufacturer, the company, says that if Breggjit is established without consent, delays on the border will cost the business.
In the Bernaston factory in Toyota, Olis and Abensis were produced, and 90 percent of the 150,000 cars produced last year were exported to foreign European countries.
Marvin Cook, director of the Barnaston factory in Toyota, said, "If the United Kingdom is forced to leave the EU at the end of March, we will stop manufacturing in factories."
Honda, BMW, Jaggerland Rover, and other British auto manufacturers are concerned about leaving the EU without an agreement on trade across the border.
For example, the BMW will shut down its ‘mini’ factory in Oxford for a month.
The main concern of each car manufacturer is the risk of the supply chain in the absence of agreements.
Toyota's manufacturing line is based on "Just-in-time" with the custom-made vehicles that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers within the United Kingdom and in the EU.
According to the automobile industry, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without consent on March 29, it could lead to delays in the border, resulting in slow or short arrival of parts.
Toyota cannot maintain more than a day's supply in its Darbyshire factory, which is why manufacturing is to stop.
Clark said that the "checkers Plan" that Prime Minister May presented for future relations with the EU "is elaborately designed to avoid tests at the border where industry is concerned.
"We need an agreement, which means we want the best possible agreement not only to enjoy the present success but also to take the occasion as a chance," he said on a BBC radio show on 4 Tsday.
"We need to be able to complete the supply chain which has worked so well until now."
Although Toyota does not know how long it will be to stop manufacturing, she claims that in the long run, additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and will eventually affect employment.
Peter Zovaris, who has been working at the Barnaston factory for 24 years and represents the unions, said that there is growing concern among the union members:
"The government is offering a solid and reliable plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU."
"Trump and Rosenstein's conference could be postponed."
The High Level Conference, which is scheduled for President Donald Trump and Vice-President Rob Rosenstein, announced on Sunday that it is possible to postpone the "one more week" due to the ongoing conflict over the candidate for Bret Kabaneau's Supreme Court.
Rosenstein is overseeing special agents Robert Morah, who are investigating the Russian election intervention, the connection between the President of Trump and Russia, and the violation of his justice.
Over the past few months, attention has been coming from around Washington as to whether the President of State has removed the vice-president of justice and has affected Mora.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein attended a meeting with a device to record his conversation with President Trump, and that it was possible to avoid him through Article 25 of the U.S. Constitution.
Mr. Rosenstein denied the press.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House and reported his resignation.
After this, it was announced that a meeting will be held with the President of the United Nations at New York’s headquarters on Thursday.
The President of Cards, Rozenstein said "I don't want to," but then the meeting with him was postponed because the Senate Judicial Committee had a heavy budget of hearings and plans.
Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation of the FBI against Mr. Ka'Dave.
Sara Sanders, a reporter for the card, interviewed Fox News on Saturday.
I was asked about a meeting with Mr. Rosenstein, and she said, "We haven't finished that day yet.
It's going to be clear to us in the future.
Some reporters will disagree about their statements: Sanders has not been to Press Breig at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefing did not mean that the TV reporter didn't like the stand-up: she said that they can't deny that they are playing.
It suggests that there will be more direct contact between Mr. playing cards and the press.
He also said that Trump spent more time with questions than with previous presidents, but did not give evidence: "The number of times it is confirmed."
"If the press has a chance to question the President of the United States, it should be better than asking me questions.
We're trying so hard to make this happen that you know we've been doing a lot over the past few weeks.
He is often asked questions when going out of the White House to attend public sessions and press conferences for guests:
But there are few single press conferences.
The reason for this is the nature of the president's wildness in New York this week and his unnatural appearance in front of reporters.
I am writing to the Scottish NHS workers from the EU, who are disturbed by the anxiety caused by the insurance minister, Bregggit.
The insurance minister informed EU staff workers at ScotlandNHS that they would appreciate their country as a country and that they would want to remain in the same profession after Bregggit.
Six months after Britain left the EU, MSP's Jean Freema published his letter:
The government of Scotland has promised to provide EU citizens who are already working on developed public services to meet the cost of formal living requirements.
In his letter, Freeman writes: "In this summer, the British and EU negotiations for suspension continued, and it is expected that they will reach their conclusion in the fall.
But the British government has also taken into account the possibility of a normal scenario and is preparing for it.
I'm sure this is a very uncomfortable time for all of you.
So I'm going to repeat it again, but I want to tell you that I think the contribution of all the staff members, regardless of nationality, is very valuable.
My colleagues from EU and other countries bring valuable experience and technology, improve health services, and contribute to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and I strongly hope you stay here.
Christion Abalonby, wound to the head and emergency surgery.
Kristion Aberlonby, a tiger back in Tennessee, reports that on Saturday, when he was defeated at 31-27 by Vanderbilt Composts, he was injured on the head and had an emergency operation, with Tenesian Mike Organ reporting:
According to head coach Rod Reed of Tennessee, the injuries occurred shortly before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and fell there," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff took oxygen in the sideline before they put the Abalonbys on the stretcher and brought them to the stretcher for further examination.
Tennessee's spokesman, Chris Harris, told WSMV that Abalonby was operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee:
Harris added, "I don't know much about the type of injuries and severity yet."
For the second year of the Red Shirt, Aberlonby player, this was the first season in the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he succeeded in making five total tackles until he left the game, and 18 times in the season.
Foreigners in British real estate pay a paper tax, a higher amount.
Foreigners will pay a higher paper tax to buy British real estates.
Kobin succeeded in collecting youth votes, but the movement is expected to counter it.
The paper tax increase is directed at those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
It is expected that the seniority agency will earn more than 120 million pounds per year, and this will be part of the homeless support.
Today, Prime Minister Teresa May announced that foreign buyers will be subject to a higher tax on paper when buying British real estates and that profits will be spent on homeless aid.
Jeremy Corvin has succeeded in collecting youth votes, but this movement is seen as an attempt to combat the power by promising to tax higher incomes while providing more cheap housing.
Paper tax increases are imposed on individuals and lawyers who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The tax increases are added to the current paper tax, which is up to 3%.
The seniority agency predicts that this will produce a profit of 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s new property is purchased by non-EU residents, which increases housing prices, making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to buy homes.
The rich communities in Britain, especially the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the increase in foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new policy was announced a week after Boris Johnson proposed cutting the paper tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first housing.
He accused major construction companies of taking over the land to keep their housing prices high and urged Prime Minister May to end the low-cost housing limit so that he could correct the British "home problem":
Cobin has also released a series of proposals that have been highlighted as housing reform, including the curbing of rents and the elimination of the push-up of “no credit”.
He also wants to empower the parliament to build a new home.
Last year, Prime Minister May said, "I told the Prime Minister that I would try to rebuild the British dream through his office.
This is also about restoring our broken housing market.
And that's what we're talking about.
However, while British citizens work hard, the situation is never desirable for individuals and foreign companies who do not live in Britain and who do not live in the United Kingdom to afford housing.
For many people with dreams of having a home, this has become a far-off dream.
(Laughter)
Sanderland's boss, Jack Ross, said that one day he will be manager of the Scotland team.
The team's 42th, Scotland, is trying to revive the North East Club.
Last season, he led St. Milan to Scotland Premium and moved this summer to the Stadium of Light.
"I wanted to play as a player in my mother's country.
"I've got a B cap, but that's all."
"When I was a kid, my dad and I grew up watching the Scotland team in Hamden.
"You can't get this kind of opportunity unless you succeed in the club management."
Before Los Angeles, Sanderland managers were Dick Adhocquet, David Moyles, Sam Aradis, Martin O’Neil, Roy Keane, Gustavo Poje, and Paulo di Carnio.
Aroa Asretique's former boss says he is not afraid to share his name with famous people in such famous clubs.
"My success now depends on getting this club back to the Premium League.
The club's organization and facilities are without doubt the Premium League itself."
"It's never easy to get there, but I don't think it's likely successful unless you get the club back there."
Mr. Ross's manager's career is only three years old, but he's an assistant boss in Dunton and has 15 months of experience with coaching staff members in Hertz.
After that, he restored Aroa from his position in third place and led St. Milan, who was downgraded for the next season, to the winner of the championship title.
Ross says he's more calm now than he was when he played in Clyde, Harthurpool, Volker, St. Milan, Hamilton Acadamic.
"It was really a branch of my life."
"I really felt that the management was better than the players.
I've done a lot of work, and I've been doing a lot better as a player, so this might sound strange.
But playing is tough.
We're going to do a lot of work every week.
It's like you're good at it. You're good at it. You're good at it.
I've always wanted to work in management, and that's what's happening now.
The introduction of the interview will be broadcast on September 30th at the sound of RadioScottland's sports at 12:00 and 13:00 in British summertime.
Research indicates that the best time for drinking is 5:30 p.m. Saturday afternoon.
British pubs are in trouble, but they are increasing sales due to the intense heat of summer, while the chain of restaurants is a further burden.
According to the survey, sales in July increased 2.7% in the pub bar, down by 4.8% in restaurants.
Peter Martin, a business consultant for CGA, who compiled the results of the survey, said: "A day of intense sunlight and a longer fight in the World Cup than the United Kingdom was expected to have led to July, which was almost in June of the previous month.
In June, the restaurant business fell by 13.8%.
In the last year's synchronization ratio, the pubs and bars, which are the main products of the drink, are the best ones.
It's not as strong as the restaurant business, but it's suffering from the strength of the sun.
It looks like people are drinking.
The sales of drinks in the pubs and bars in charge increased by 6.6% a month, but in the case of meals, 3% less."
“These results have continued to be seen since the end of April.”
The weather and massive social and sports events are a major factor in the sales of the food industry.
It's no longer surprising that the business of the restaurant group has continued, but it's particularly painful to see that the sales have dropped by 4.8 percent in the previous year, with the cost pressure going on.
"A long and bitter summer heat came at an even worse time for those who make food their main product.
In July, sales in the entire pub and restaurant, including the new open business, increased 2.7%.
Café People Trackers monitor the industrial sales of British pubs, bars, and restaurant sectors, collecting and analyzing performance data from 47 management groups.
One in five children has a social media account hidden from their parents.
A study revealed that 1 in 5 children has a social media account hidden from their parents and teachers, including children of 11 years of age.
The study was conducted on 20,000 middle school students, and found that "false Instagram" pages have increased.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
It is said that 20% of students have a main account to show their parents.
One in five children has created a social media account hidden from adults, including children of 11 years of age.
The study was conducted for 20,000 middle school students, and found that the fake Instagram page was rapidly increasing.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
20% of the students are said to have a " main" account and a secret account at the same time to show their parents that they don't like the content.
One mother happened to find her 13-year-old daughter's secret website and found her posting "raping" to others.
The study was conducted by the presidents of the Digital Applesuk and the Independent School (HMC), and 40 percent of students between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, one of which was a secret account.
“I'm shocked to learn that many teenagers want to create an online space that their parents and teachers can’t find,” says Mike Butchhaman, chief of the HMC.
All right, I'm going to be with the Scottish Asretic Committee.
At a general meeting of the Scottish Asretiques Committee, Erry Dril was elected as the non-exclusive director.
Dries is the most brilliant lander in Scotland, and President Ian Bety said this decision is a good opportunity to use her experience at an international level during the past decade.
"We are convinced that the Asretic world in Scotland will benefit us greatly by being elected as a member of the community of Scotland, England and the rest of the world," he says.
"I want to work hard to reach the voices of athletes and I hope I can help you to contribute and fight."
He won four Olympic gold medals, including 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympic Games.
He posted on Twitter: “Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor told me that it's not going to be long before I'm able to recover.
It's a very difficult journey, but it's completely recovered and able to walk again.
Thank you for the encouraging message!
An advertisement for a milk machine looking at a milk cow, and two online opinions.
The manufacturer of the milk machine has released an ad that looks like a milk cow that is milking its mother while she is nursing, and online, there are two voices.
Elby, a consumer technology company, published an advertisement inspired by a comical music video during the announcement of the World's First Silentware Ruble.
'I'm milking myself, and I don't think it's any use.'
Corrus continues: "Water the milk, milk it, feed it to the baby, milk it, milk it, milk it, milk it, milk it, and I milk the human woman."
The advertisement, published on its Facebook page, provoked an online controversy.
The video was played 77,000 times, hundreds of comments were received, and the reaction from the audience was rejected, and many of them were saying that the ad exposed the “fear” of the dairy industry in broad daylight.
"The use of milk to advertise this product is a very wrong decision.
like us, the cows get pregnant and have to give birth.
Elby's milkman fits the inside of her breast-feeding bra.
Another comment says: "Of course, this is traumatic for the mother and baby.
How about a human mother using a cow when she doesn't take a baby?
One person adds: "It's an impossible ad."
Some defend this ad, one woman says she's been laughing at this song.
"I think it's a genius idea.
I think I'm using it myself if I'm still feeding.
Milk makes me feel really like a cow.
I'm convinced that advertising is just a little crazy.
Some said, "This is a great product."
"This is an interesting ad for a mom who thinks she's feeding her baby (at work or in the toilet) and she's like a cow."
It's not an ad that celebrates and criticizes the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women who were dancing were hiding the pump in the brager.
The concept of the campaign is that many of the women who nurse are saying that they are like cows.
However, Elvié Plump is silent, has no wires, no tubes, and can move freely, hold a baby, or even go out while nursing.
"Elvie Plump is an innovative product, I think it was a bold and exciting product.
By comparing the feminine expression with the milk, the aim was to focus on breast feeding and all its problems and to make fun of the incredible sense of freedom that new feedings bring.
This is not the first time Elvie Pump has been taken seriously.
During the week of London fashion Week, the mother of the two children who used the product appeared on the runway with designer Marta Jakwowski.
We secretly transferred hundreds of immigrant children to tents on Texas border to camps.
The number of immigrants who traveled for a month did not change, but the number of children who were detained increased rapidly, which is why some of the harsh retries and policies of the Trump regime made it difficult for the children to be entrusted to the sponsors.
Until now, most of the sponsors are themselves secret immigrants and have been afraid to risk their stay by applying for children.
The risk increased as federal authorities in June and other adults in the family had to submit fingerprints and the data was announced to be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Alvens, senior officer of the immigration tax enforcement department, testified to the arrest of several dozen employees who applied for underage security.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests had no criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are guaranteed or guaranteed to stay in the country illegally, and most of them are foreigners with criminal record.
"I'm not going to be able to track people like that," Arvens said.
According to the camp workers, they introduced a new rule requiring some of them to appear in court within a month, not 60 days after the previous standard of detention.
Many will appear on video calls instead of on their own court, and will file legal claims to the immigration authorities' judges.
Those who are deemed unfit for relief will be deported immediately.
According to reports from camp workers and internals over the past few months, the prolonged detention of children makes it easier for them to feel insecure and depressed and thus become violent or fleeing.
Proponents said there is growing concern that large institutions such as Tolniyo are showing signs of children facing difficulties on their own scale.
In an emotionally prepared manner, he added that moving children to tents without giving them enough time to say good-bye to their friends could make the trauma worse for them already.
Syria has ordered the occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid Al-Murem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly, called for Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the fact that the war in the country was in the eighth year.
The deputy prime minister, M'Alem, stated that the foreign forces were, as it were, illegally stationed their war on Syrian soil, "acting accordingly."
"I need to retreat immediately and without reservation."
He claimed that since 2011, 360,000 people have died and millions have been displaced from their homes "the war on terrorism is almost over."
Syria said she would continue this holy war until she wiped out the terrorist groups and the "unlawful foreigners" from all over Syria.
The United States is stationed 2,000 soldiers in Syria to train and direct the Kurds and Syrians against President Walsherd al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground forces in a war-crazed country.
In the refugee issue, Muerem blames some "Western countries" for spreading "unseen fears" so that they remain outside the country.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to encourage them to return home."
"What should be purely a humanitarian issue they are politicalizing."
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not support the rebuilding of Syria until Asad and the opposing forces made political agreements to end the war.
A UN diplomat says that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the end of the Idlib rebels created an opportunity to move ahead in political dialogue:
Russian and Turkish agreements have prevented massive attacks by Syrian forces supporting the Russian army against the three million people living in this province.
However, Muerem stressed that the agreement has a "confirmed deadline" and stated that military action targets the jihadists, including al-Qaeda fighters who are linked to al-Qaeda.
The UN envoy, Stefan de Mistura, wants to gather early for the first meeting of a new committee of both government and opposition members, to draft the post-war Syrian constitution and achieve elections.
Mualem stated that the Syrian government was to join the committee and that the work of the committee should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interference:
That's why you're re-selecting the cards.
According to the logic, Trump will be re-electiond in 2020 unless he is the president of the country in the early fall of the war and scandal, as many liberal viewers would like to see.
It's going to be "the most dramatic President of the world."
So far, there's no sign that the viewers are getting bored.
Since 2014, the number of Golden Hour viewers has increased by more than 1.5 million in CNN, and the MSNBC has almost tripled.
According to Neilsen, Fox News has increased the average golden hour audience from 17.7 million to 2.4 million four years ago, and the MSNBC Rachel Madrid show has recorded up to 350 million viewers on the main news channel at night.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, which is not understood," said Neil Bea of the Director of the ABC Drama "Saubber: President of Destiny", who has been leading the ministers who have become presidents after the attack on the capital.

An external money surged into the middle of the House of Representatives' election, which is expected to end in an interim election.
It is not surprising that funds are flowing into the 17th district of Pennsylvania where two people have been fighting for the same seat by re-interpretation of the district of Parliament.
In this recent election district outside Pittsburgh, Democrat Connor Lam, who won a seat in another district last spring in a special election, has been running for the election.
The candidate against Ram is Keith Rossfus, a former Republican in the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely duplicated with the 17th.
In January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the former district of elections would be an illegal advantage to the Republicans.
The new 17th section of the election has become a fierce struggle that has funded the Democratic Movement Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Movement Committee (NRCC).
Ram won a special election in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March and became known in Pennsylvania.
It was held by the Republicans for more than ten years, and President Donald Cards won at 20 points in the district.
Political critics believe that the Democrats have a slight advantage.

He stayed in a hotel in Panama until he had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Valera of Panama in June 2017 and they pulled out the team from the Trump camp.
The minister's spokesman, Heather Naart, announced earlier this month that the Ministry of State has decided to bring back the heads of U.S. foreign embassies from El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Panama, and Panama for "the latest decision to stop Taiwan's approval."
However, the penalty was considered only El Salvador, which in 2017 supported an estimated 140 million US dollars in support of drug addicts, development and economic support.
The sanctions, including reduced financial aid and the visa restrictions, were painful for the Central American country, suffering from high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal considerations continued, North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level conference that focused on security and economic development, following a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in preventing migration to the United States.
But by the middle of September, government officials had declared that they wanted to proceed, and they had virtually finished considering the penalty for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pens says he is going to speak in the parliament scheduled for mid- of October about the imports that the government is seeking to discuss.
Without a new hard message or punishment from the United States, three envoys have secretly returned from El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Panama.
Mr. Bolton of the White House refused to comment on the details discussed by three high-ranking U.S. officials.
These explanations were confirmed by an external analyst from government sources who spoke anonymously.
Research History
The next move could be a report by Robert Mueller, special counsel on the possibility of disrupting Mr. Trump's justice.
Müller, according to reports, is looking into whether Trump's campaign was working with Russia, the target of the US election.
If the parliament changes, Trump will be accountable to the majority party and the jury as he prepares to re-election.
There are many assumptions, but that doesn't necessarily mean that Trump or the head of Europe will lose his job.
We need to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic to determine how long the difficulty is going to last.
Only if the West resisted Hitler and supported the Czechs in Munich were German officials ready to take a coup against Hitler in 1938.
I failed and missed the opportunity to avoid a massacre that lasted for many years.
History turns to such a turning point and accelerates and hinders the harsh progress of democracy.
Americans face some of these shift points.
What would happen if the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, who holds the fate of Mueller's investigation, was removed?
The article suggests that Rosenstein was secretly recording the president last year, and that the president had speculated that he was not fit for his mission.
Rosenstein says the article in the Times is inaccurate:
"How would you react if the Supreme Court approved a new investigation by the FBI against Mr. Brett, if it was not complete or just, or if there were strong accusations against sexual assault and false testimony?
Would we vote for the mid-term election of Congress that holds Mr. Trump responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will enter the long winter.
But I don't think I'll fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother is a Czech-American Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that took over my ambassador's house.
She survived to move to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to join a Sabbath candle at a table covered with vodka.
How can I not see the future with such a tradition in mind?

The Rangers Graham, Drands are confident that the Rapid Vienna war will be fought.
The Rangers will welcome Lapid Vienna to their home on Thursday, which is the first day of the month in Spain to share with the Bijaleal and win the Austria team against the next match, is more likely to break through the group G in the European League.
Midfillder Graham Drains believes the Rangers will be able to make a further leap out of the results, even though he has not been in the season in his knee to the point where he's separated by two to two.
A 31-year-old player said, "I'm glad I got the point because I'm a good team."
"We believed we could win at least one point when we entered the game.
I'm going to show you a few examples.
I think the first part was good, but we were strong in the second half, and we won the game.
Thursday night is a big fight in the European League.
I hope I get three points, but the team was getting good results from the previous game, so it's going to be a hard game.
Last year, my injuries, changes in clubs, and so forth, made me very old, but now I feel comfortable.
The team is doing great, the teammates are enjoying it, training is great.
From now on, we'll forget about the last season and work hard to make it work.
I'm not sure if that's true.
Despite the clear idea of what kind of care they want to be cared for, those who are talking about their families and their families are a decimal.
According to a nationwide survey, about half of them are talking about the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of the kids were talking about it.
“People want to take care of their families, but they haven’t actually talked,” said Holly Snyder, a national life insurance company.
I'll show you how to start a conversation.
I can't prepare my family to take care of me unless I know what I want before I know what I want.
We're going to talk about where and how to be cared for with the advisers and family members.
We're going to use a Financial Advisor to help us figure out how to pay for such expenses.
The selection of long-term care funds can include long-term care, expenses, and hybrid cash-valued life insurance, which is self-financed as long as the money is available.
We'll create a legal document to prevent legal conflicts at the brink.
If you cannot oversee medical care, and if you cannot communicate, prepare a medical agent to appoint a trusted individual to ensure that the expert will follow your wishes.
We'll also consider the Commission on Financials.
If you can't do it, you can do the finance decision instead, and choose someone you can trust to make sure that you pay the bill.
I don't forget the details.
Can you answer any questions about medication or allergies?
Let's write out some details on the plan to get ready.

Men are shot several times by air rifles at Ilfrankom.
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle on his way home from the night out.
Victims in their 40s were in Oxford Globe in Devon, Ilfrankom, when they were shot in the chest, abdomen, and hands.
Police officers described shooting around 2:30 a.m. in the summer hours of the United Kingdom as "free shooting."
The victim didn't see the attackers.
Injuries are not life-threatening, but police are asking witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indochia.
The director said that at least 384 people will be killed and more killed on Friday by the powerful earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Par.
Communications are confused, and rescue officials are unable to get any information from the province of Dongara, in the north of the Paran region near the 7.5 earthquake site.
In Par, 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Next comes the main facts about Par and Dongara in Sulawesi.
Pul is the capital of the small bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, estimated to have a population of 379,800 by 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongara is more than 300 kilometers along the Northwest coast of Sulawesi.
In 2017, it was estimated that there were 299,200 people.
Fishing and farming are the main industries in the coastal areas of the Central Sulawesi region, especially in Dongara.
Nikkel mining is also important in the state, but it is mostly focused on the Molowali on the coast on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Agency, Palm and Dongara have been affected several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by the tsunami, and hundreds of homes were destroyed in Dongara.
West Dongara was hit by a tsunami in 1996, and nine people died.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific volcano range and is experiencing frequent earthquakes.
The following shows the recent major earthquake and tsunami:
2004: A massive earthquake hit the west coast of the province of Ache, northern Indonesia, on December 26, 2013, killing 226,000 people along the Indian coast, and more than half of them in Asche.
2005: A strong earthquake hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nyas off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale occurred in southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, killing nearly 700 people, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake on the Richter scale near the capital city of Padan, West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 on the island of Mentai, off the coast of Sumatra, caused a tsunami of up to 30 feet [10 m] high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake in the province of Pidi Jaya, Acche, suffered devastating damage, and people became panicky as they remembered the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
The tsunami did not occur this time, but the destruction of the building killed more than 100 people.
2018: A major earthquake hit the island of Lonbok, Indonesia, where more than 500 people were killed, most of them on the north side of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake, and many tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest man was arrested for domestic violence.
Former governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin's oldest son, Palin, was arrested for assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska state police, the 29-year-old of Yulra, Alaska, was arrested for being accused of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence, and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, an acquaintance of the woman tried to inform the police about the crime, and he took her phone.
According to KTU, Palin's been remanded to a pre-trial trial facility in Mattsou and held for $500.
According to the network, he appeared on Saturday and claimed to be "not guilty."
Palin could be charged with three minor crimes in class A, maximum prison time, 25 grand a year.
He's also charged with a day's imprisonment and a $2000 fine in class B.
It's not the first criminal lawsuit against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sara Palin, reported the assault on the police.
The case is currently in trial at the Alaska State Retirement Court.
In January 2016, he was arrested for being accused of domestic violence, for interfering with domestic violence reports, and for holding arms in connection with the incident.
He claimed his girlfriend was hit in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 because her son's violence was linked to PSTD, which is responsible for military service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people died.
On Friday, the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed 384 people.
An earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks will shut down, and the number of deaths will be increasing.
The earthquake occurred in central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital city, Djakarta.
Videos that capture the moment of impact are spreading through social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at Par's beach festival when the tsunami swept over the coast.
Federal police are demanding the death penalty of a suspected terrorist in New York City.
The federal police in New York City are demanding the death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City, killing eight people, a very rare request that has not been made in the state since 1953.
Sypov, a 30-year-old, used a truck borrowed from his home depo, attacked him on a bike road along the West Side highway in Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclones indiscriminately.
In order to justify Sypov's death penalty, the prosecutor needs to prove that Sypov deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately injured them.
According to a court document, both charges could be executed.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury charged Sipoff with 22 charges of murder, assault and destruction of cars, for threats commonly used by the federal prosecutor in an organized crime case.
The prosecutor said that the attack was necessary for “good planning and planning” and that Sypov's crimes were "bad, brutal, and degrading.”
"Cyphro Havibri-Spain-Sipoff says the intention is "to hurt Diego, Angeline, Nicholas, Andrellard, Dérard, Adrellard, Aririll, Fernan, Arnan, Diego, Mendoza, Alejandro Darmian Paco, and bring loss to his family and friends."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the death penalty was requested in the south of New York was ten years ago.
The defendant, Karid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug donors, but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 when Jias Rosenberg and Ethel Rosenberg, guilty of spying on Soviets during the Cold War two years ago.
On June 19, 1953, Mr. and Mrs. Rosenberg were executed.
Sypov, who is from Uzbekistan, did not show his conscience any more than a few days or months after the attack.
The police said he didn't regret going to the police.
According to the charges, Sypov told the authorities that he had come up with an attack by watching ISIS videos on his cell phone.
The police also announced that the ISIS flag was requested to be set up in the sick room.
He also claims to be innocent of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the Federal Prosecutor for Sipoff, said he was "clearly disappointed" in the decision made by the prosecutor.
"We don't believe that we will accept the conviction of jail sentences that are unlikely to be released, but that the death penalty will only prolong the trauma of such events to all concerned," Patton said.
Sypov's lawyers asked the prosecutor not to ask for the death penalty.
The conservatives have said that British EU withdrawal negotiations are a good opportunity for Mr. Niger Faraj.
Nigel Faraj today declared that “the people’s army will be mobilized” during a protest against the conservative conference.
The former leader of the independent British party had to feel pressure from European skeptics because one of the MPs of Teriza May said he was fit to negotiate with the EU.
Bishop Peter Bourne, a member of the conservative House of Representatives, said that if Faraj was the minister of the European Union, the United Kingdom had already left.
However, May's challenge to getting in touch with the ruling MPs was that the conservative party members participated in a protest against the departure of the EU in the city.
The Prime Minister is having a hard time maintaining a checkers plan for compromises in the anti-EU, the restist, and the EU's criticisms.
May's defenders argued that despite his opposition, May tried to make an agreement with the EU and had to make a choice between European skeptics and the Labor Party:
Mr. Bourne said at a rally in Solhal that "the checkers want to abandon the checkers":
He said we should consider Mr. Faraj to be a member of the EU and have him deal with the EU.
"If he had been in charge, we'd already be out."
"I support the departure of the EU, but the checkers should stop."
Disrepute against the EU, they are not allowed to fight World War I and submit to it.
We want to have our own laws.
"The idea that the British people want to reconsider and stay out of the discussion is simply not true."
Andrea Jenkins of the conservative EU also attended the rally and said to the reporter, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The checkers are not popular with the public, the opposition is not voting, the party is not even popular with activists who actually went around the streets to win the election.
I want you to drop the checkers and listen to your opinions.
In a message addressed to Mr. May, the prime minister said that he can remain in his position when he keeps his promise."
Faraj said that if we were to betray the decision to vote in 2016, politicians who participated in the rally would feel pressure.
"This is a question of trust between us, our people, our political class."
"They're going to betray their departure from the EU, so we're telling them we can't admit it now."
"I want you people to feel the pressure of the political class who are trying to betray the EU.
"We will not rest until we are proud of our independence and self-preservation."
On the other hand, the rest of the group also marched on Armingham and held a two-hour rally in the heart of the city.
This week after the formation of the group, a group of unsatisfying activists put up a banner of conservatives against leaving the EU.
At the beginning of the convention, the union party's bar barons, Adonis, scoffed at the conservative party’s security app.
They introduced the IT system and said that Canada and all other technologies could achieve free trade without borders and free trade in Ireland."
It's a complete joke.
"There's no such thing as a good EU departure."
Mr. Warren is preparing for the presidential election.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she's "prevently prepared for the presidential election" after the election in November.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about their future on Saturday during a dialogue rally in western Massachusetts.
Wallen, a frequent critic of President Donald Cards, is working against Republican Jeff Diehl, who is the vice president of the election campaign for Trump in 2016, in Massachusetts.
She's worried that she's going to challenge Mr. Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holland was a dialogue with Mr. Trump, who became president of the 36th election.
One of the participants asked if she wanted to win the presidential election.
Warren said it was time for a woman to "removal the broken government for the White House" and "it includes the female president."
We're under arrest for the Simms shooting at Louisiana State University.
Baton, Louisiana, Luju Police announced on Saturday that basketball player Wade Simms of Louisiana State University arrested a suspect for the shooting on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced that they arrested Dhitheon Simpson (20) at 11 a.m.
The police released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for information to identify the man in the video.
Twenty-year-old Simms was shot dead on a campus in UNICEF City early Friday.
According to 247sports, "Wide Simms died of a gunshot to his head," the chief police chief Murphy J. Pauls announced to the media on Saturday.
Wade broke in to save his friend's life and was shot by a Simpson.
He confessed to being on the scene, carrying weapons, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the precinct of the precinct of East Baton.
Simms, who grew up in Baton Rouge, was a 3rd-grade college student who played the 32th season of the year, 10 of which were first in the game, averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, 2.9 liunions per game.
We're on a team order that Lewis Hamilton will win Sebastian Bettel, and we're almost done with the title.
The moment Bartelli Bottas passed the race above Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the order of Mercedes played a major role in the race.
Paul Bottas, who started out in his position, had Bettel fight with Hamilton in the first two laps, and thus eliminate the possibility of Hamilton's victory.
Bettel was first pitted, Hamilton caught up with the round-up, which usually determines the race.
Hamilton on Mercedes, pitted in one lap, followed by Bettel in the third corner, forced Ferrari Bettel to take the lead when he had to leave the inside.
Max Belstapen, who was celebrating his 21st birthday, started off in the back of the grid row and took the 7th round.
Then he reduced his time, and he didn't exchange tires to get rid of the fourth raiconin, but took the lead in most of the race.
Finally, he went around 44 laps, he couldn't pace up the rest of the eight laps, and Lyconin was fourth.
It was a hard day because I was really gentlemanly all weekend to get me going.
"The team has done a great job with Finnish," Hamilton said.
It's a terrible body. It's a groundhog.
Donald Cards laughed at the claim that Senator Diane Finestein had not leaked a letter from Christine Breesey Ford, who was accusing the Supreme Court candidate of sexual assault:
The president, speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, commented that while he did not take Ford's testimony directly from the Senate Judicial Committee, the events in the Senate showed that people were “low and mean and lying”:
"One of the great things that could happen in the Senate, which has occurred in recent days, was when he saw angry people and mean, mean and lying people."
"I didn't do it when I saw the release or the leak."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane, Finestein, did you leak it?
Remember her answer, did you leak the document?
No, sir.
I didn't leak.
Wait a minute.
We've leaked, no, no, no, we're not leaking, we've added the Senator's impression.
In July, Mr. Steinstein received a letter explaining the details of his suspicions against Mr. Kabano, which was leaked early in September, denying that Reek was from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's case, I didn't leak the story," Steinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep her secret, and I kept her secret as she requested."
But because she denied it, it seemed like she was not walking with the president who commented at the Saturday night rally.
Maybe she didn't think it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
He further defended the candidate for the Supreme Court accused of committing sexual misconduct to three women, and the president is using suspicions for his own purposes.
"They are determined to take whatever steps are necessary.
"You'll see that no matter who hurt you, no matter who hurt you, you'll be able to kick anyone out to gain power and control."

The air traffic control saw hundreds of people take off during the earthquake and sacrificed their lives.
Indonesia's air traffic control has been accused of being a hero since the mission was completed until the plane took off.
More than 800 people have died and many have been missing from the tsunami that struck Sulawesi island on Friday.
A strong aftershock continued to occur in the area, and many people in the city of Par are trapped in rubble.
A colleague of mine, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan, did not run away from his mission at the vehement tower at Mutiara, Sis, Al Julfy Airport.
He stayed until he saw that flight 6321, which was on the runway during the earthquake, took off safely.
Then I thought the tower had collapsed, and I jumped.
Then he died in a hospital.
Joel Searat, a spokesman for air navigation and Indonesia, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, and the ABC News in Australia reported:
He got a helicopter from Baricone, Carimantan, and took him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived.
"This news is breaking our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities feared that the number of deaths would reach 1,000, and the National Security Agency said access to Dongala, Shigi and Bhuton was limited.
“It is estimated that many people are still under the rubble and are still unable to rescue them, so the number of casualties will increase,” said a spokesman for the authorities, Stopo Nugrojo.
A 20-foot tsunami destroyed the pulp, and a mass burial is scheduled for Sunday.
Military and commercial planes carry relief supplies and supplies.
Risa, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News that an ambulance was carrying a body every minute.
We're running out of clean water.
The minimarkets are being plundered everywhere."
President Jean Gerfando of Indonesia’s International Red Cross told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but what do you think you see here?
This is already a tragic situation, and it could get worse.
Indonesia's President Joko Widd came to Par on Sunday and told the army, "I want you all to work day and night to complete whatever mission you need to evacuate.
"Are you ready?"
Indonesia had an earthquake in Ronbok earlier this year and more than 550 people have died.
The Micronesian plane crash: Air Niwney said a plane crashed on a coral reef, and one of them went missing.
A flight company that crashed on a coral reef in the Pacific off the coast of Micronesia initially said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safe from the sinking plane, but one man said it was missing.
Air Niugini announced at the end of Saturday afternoon that one male passenger was missing.
The airlines have been working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to confirm the whereabouts of men.
The airlines did not respond immediately to detailed requests for passengers, such as their age and nationality.
A local boat rescued the other passengers and crew of the plane that crashed into the ocean trying to land on Tuk Island.
Authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday and they were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the sequence of events remain unknown.
The airlines and the U.S. Navy both announced that the plane had crashed into a coral reef before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was way past the runway.
American passenger Bill, Mr. Janes said the plane was in the low air.
"It was very good," he said.
Janes says he and others have arrived at the emergency exit of a plane that's been sinking through the waist-like water.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that the sailors who were renovating the docks also used an expanding boat to bring people back to shore and that the plane had helped rescue them before setting down about a hundred feet.
Air Safety Network data indicates that in the last 20 years, 111 people have died in the crash of a PNG airline.
Anatomist explains the time line of the night when women were burned alive
In a review of a man accused of burning a living Mississippi woman in 2014, the prosecutor's office made a final statement on Saturday.
Paul Loret, an analyst for the U.S. Justice Department, testified for several hours as an expert in information analysis.
He used cell phone records to track her movements with her 29-year-old defendant, Kinton Terris, on the day the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers died.
Loret said he got some data on the location of Teri's cell phone that was with him on the night of the death of Chambers.
When he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cell phone data showed that he was with Chambers, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood up on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Terris if it was true that he was in a Sanford truck that night, he testified that his truck was in Nashville and that he was lying.
He also contradicted what he said about meeting with Terris about two weeks when Chambers died.
According to cell phone records, we only met a week ago.
She said some time after the death of Chambers, Terris removed the text, phone calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," he said.
The defendant will begin his final appeal on Sunday.
The judge said that after that day, the trial will be transferred to the jury verdict.
What's rational hip-hop?
Three hip-hop groups are trying to challenge the negative image of the genre by sending positive messages to the music.
The Hih Breed from Brisbane claims that hiphop has left the roots of political messages and social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and get back to Consciss hip hop.
Artists like Hozzes and Commons, through artists like Akara and Roky, have seen the latest resurrection in UK.
Black again?
A charge against a couple who were fired after "racial" text in New York City.
A New York baby sitter accused the couple of being unjustly fired after their mother misposted, and they were fired after receiving a text from the black man saying, "The black man is here."
The couple called the lawsuit "a forced act" and denied being racist.
The mother of two children, Lyndsey Pakko-Flaxman, was puzzled to learn that the new baby-sitter, Giselle Morris, was black when he arrived on his first day in 2016.
"The Blacks again" and "Pakkofxman" sent text to her husband.
But the text sent to Mollys twice instead of to her husband.
According to the New York Post, Pakko-Fracksman, after realizing his failure, said that he had fired Morris, saying that the African American baby - who had quit his job in the past, was expecting Filipinos instead of Filipinos because of poor work.
Maurice received a day's pay and was returned to his home in Uber.
This time, Morris accused the couple of being fired, demanding that they pay $350 a day for their initial living quarters, although they had no contract.
"I'm going to tell them that we shouldn't do this," she said to the post on Friday and added, "I know this is discrimination."
They denied the charge that they were racist, and after making Morris uncomfortable her, they claimed that the dismissal was justified because of her untrustworthy fear.
"My wife sent her some text, but that's not what I meant.
She's not a racist.
"We are not racist, my husband, Joel Pulko, told the post:
"But even if you're wrong, can you leave your children with someone who's rude?"
Your newborn baby?
I can't.
Pakko said his wife had only two weeks to give birth to a baby and it was a very difficult situation.
"Do you treat someone in such a difficult situation like this?"
So let's say that this is a bank.
While the legal case is going on, the public of the court is rapidly spreading, and couples are being blamed on social media, and their actions and logic are being changed.
Paddington Paveler, a talking bear told the readers of a new letter about the fear that their readers would not accept:
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was soon born after receiving the book, told about the letter: "Before being published, it’s hard to imagine someone reading it for the first time.
Now, what we know about Paddington is a great success.
Before her father, who worked as a BBC photographer under inspiration by a small bear toy, said that he would have been optimistic even if his job was not accepted.
She described Paddington as "a member of our very important family" and added that he was silent and proud of his ultimate success.
"He was so quiet, he was so proud of me," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he felt as if he had done something, as if he had not done anything, that he was proud of him.
I think that's how my father felt about Paddington's success.
It was his creation and imagination, but he always praised Paddington himself.
My daughter was on her deathbed, and I had to say good-bye to her over the phone.
When we landed, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2, a hospital in Nyes, where doctors treated her with a deep desire.
"I don't think she's going to survive in a very dangerous state."
"And Nad said, "She'll be dead in two minutes, and I have to say good-bye."
And I told him.
"I love you so much," he said.
I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.
The medication that the doctor gave her to stop her heart was slowly removed, and her movements stopped.
She was already dead and this was all stopped.
I just sat there and waited, knowing that everything was going on.
I was surrounded by many family companions and people, so I couldn't scream, scream, or cry.
I had to put up with it.
In the grief of losing her daughter, Ednan Raperulus soon got on the plane alongside other passengers and had to endure the situation.
"No one knew," she said.
"I lay down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was this flight that felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
He really loved his daughter."
Sad women put their cards on the bridge to prevent suicide.
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide are working to prevent the attempt to destroy their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys keep a card on the Wales Bridge with a mind-blowing message and a phone number to support.
His son, Tyler, suffered from depression when he was 13 and lost his life at 18 years of age.
“I don’t want any parents to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a smiling, promising chef:
"Everyone knew his smile.
"What's the matter with you?"
But he was in a really dark place, and before he died, he came to work.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, discovered his brother's death.
"I don't know what I'm talking about."
"I want people to know that even if you're a friend, you have someone to talk to.
Don't sit down in silence--don't talk.
Davis and her friends over the years, Humphreys, lost her 15-year partner Mark soon after his mother's death.
She said, "He's depressed, depressed, and didn't say anything."
And he said, "What's wrong with you?"
"He was very depressed on Christmas day--he didn't look and do nothing to the kids when they were opening presents."
She said his death was a great trauma for the children, but she had to overcome it.
So we're going to split it into two pieces.
But we all have to fight with this."

The F.B.I.'s investigation has led to an unpredictable future for Bretkabano.
"In the limited time and range investigations, we thought that if we could get what we really wanted, we would be able to unite a little.
Why didn't Mr. Banner and his Republican supporters like the FBI's investigations?
Their hesitation is all about timing.
The middle elections are approaching November 6, five weeks later, and if the Republicans fail, as expected, they will become very weak in the human selection that they wanted to get to the Supreme Court of the United States.
George W. Bush called the senators one after the other and pressured them to support Kabano and his wife, Ashley, who was his secretary at the White House.
What happens after the FBI makes that report?
The elections will begin in the Senate with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Whether Kabano can win at least 50 votes in the Senate is still uncertain, and vice president Mike Pances will defeat the same number of votes and grant him to the Supreme Court.
A drop in the number of refugees in North Korea during the Kim regime.
After Kim John took over seven years ago, North Korea's number of refugees has decreased, according to South Korean lawmakers.
Park Bienseg, who quoted data from the Ministry of Unity in Korea, said that last year there were 1,127 compared to the 2,706 deportees in 2011.
Pak said the high rate of border control and illegal entryrs is the main cause:
Pyongyang hasn't published a public comment.
Many refugees from the north will soon be offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the challenging war in 1953.
Many of them have the longest border with North Korea and escape through China, which is easily crossed by a heavily armed region (DMZ) that lies between South and South.
China sees refugees as more illegal immigrants and often deported them.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still at war, has been significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the staging non-nuclear negotiations.
This was done after a general agreement was made for the nuclearization of the Korean peninsula at the historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
But Sunday, North Korean Foreign Minister Li Yonho has condemned US sanctions that haven't made any progress since.
“We are not convinced of the safety of the country without trust in the United States, and we will not have to denuclearize ourselves in such a situation,” Li said in a speech of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Perrossi said to Brett Kabano that it was not appropriate to serve in the Supreme Court of "Hysteric"
Nancy Perrossi, head of the House's Minor Party, called the Supreme Court's candidate Bretkabano "Histerical" and said that his temperament was inappropriate for military service in the Supreme Court.
Peroxi commented on Sunday's interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I can't help but think that if a woman takes that attitude, she's going to be described as hysterical.
Kabano emotionalally denied Dr. Christine Breedsey Ford the claim that they committed sexual assault during the time they were adults.
During his preamble, Kabano was very emotional, sometimes screaming and closing during his family and high school debates.
He also condemned the Democrats of the committee and called the case "an unusual and harmonious loss of honor" in the 2016 presidential election of Hilary Clinton.
Persi said he was convinced by his testimony that he had proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
She said, "I think he's not good enough for these statements and manners towards Clinton and the Democrats.
Peroxi showed a difficult color when he was asked if he would be shot if Kabano was approved and if the Democrats of the Parliament won the majority.
"Let's say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not qualified for the Supreme Court as well as for the court he's currently engaged in."
Kabano is now a judge of the D.C. High Court.
As a Democrat, Peroxi is supposed to be a conservative trial, and she is concerned about the possibility of Caverneau ruling over health insurance changes and the Low-Wade case.
In his approval hearing, he asked whether he was going to cover up a particular Supreme Court decision.
"It's not the kind of thing that says, "It's wonderful to go to court with a hysterical and prejudiced person," Peroxi said.
And women need to do it.
It’s a strong criticism that makes sense, and the anger of many months and months will come and she can’t get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry, and Mr. Steinem says to me 45 years later:
"I don't think that's unusual, but what do you think?"
She continued: "I was very helped by some woman who was an Executive, who cried when she was angry, but when she started to cry in anger, she developed the technique, and she said to the speaker, 'I'm sad because I'm sad.'"
I'm angry.
And she just keeps crying.
And I thought it was very nice.
Tears are recognized as part of an outrage because they are not essentially understood.
One of the vivid memories of an old job in a male-dominated office, and the old woman of a cold manager who had been a little afraid from day to day, grabbed her neck and dragged her to the stairwell of the stairs, while I shed tears in an unspoken rage.
"Never let them see the tears," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad you're down.
The Democrats from Colorado, Patricia Schrader, worked for Gary Hart's presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart came out of the election after the affair he called the Monkey Business, Schrader felt very frustrated and felt that there was no reason why she should not be running for the president.
"That was not a well thought-out decision," she said, laughing in a moment of 30 years.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing we need was one more candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and seven dwarfs.
Because it was too late to start the campaign and she didn't have enough funds to raise the money, she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a defeat.
Her supporters found that even though they offered a thousand dollars to men, there were still others who offered only $250.
"I don't know what I'm talking about," she said.
When she delivered a speech declaring that she did not officially launch a campaign, she was frustrated by a system of gratitude to the people who supported her, to raise funds, to target voters instead of delegates, and to the wrath of the women's neglect.
"I don't know," said Mr. Marvel.
"Clinex would have thought I was sponsoring him.
I remember thinking, what words are written on my gravestone.
"Smooth"?
I'm going to talk about the benefits that the U.S. and the mid-commercial trade wars bring to Beijing.
While the trade wars between the United States and China are still far from over, experts say the gap between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Earlier this year, U.S. president Donald Trump issued a warning by paying taxes to major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The largest tariffs that have developed this week will be affected by a new tax, which, according to a new tax, will cover the equivalent of $200 billion (U.S.) and will be taxed on half of the products that are actually imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has retaliated in the same manner, and has recently taken 5 to 10 percent tax action on 600 billion US products.
China swears to fight the United States every time, and the world’s second largest economic power quickly withdraws.
To surrender to Washington means to surrender, but obeying the United States publicly is a great humiliation for China's Supreme Leader, Shinichi.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing handled the card correctly, the pressure of the US trade war could be a positive support for China in the long run, by reducing its dependence on two economies.
"The fact that early political decisions made by Washington or Beijing create economic chaos in both countries is more dangerous than we previously thought, as research Abigail Grace, who focuses on Asia at the New American Security Center in the sink tank, said:
Syria Foreign Minister, we're ready to return to the refugees.
Syria is asking for help to rebuild a country that has been devastated by a seven-year war.
According to the UN General Assembly, the foreign minister, Valrid Al-Malem, said that the state of the country is improving.
"Today, because of the progress in the struggle against terrorism, conditions on the earth are becoming more stable and more secure," he said.
The government continues to repair areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normal bodies.
All circumstances now have to be evacuated for acts of terrorism, an economic bias towards daily life and livelihood, and have been prepared to return to the country on their own.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million others still live in the country and need humanitarian support.
Al-Murem said the Syrian regime welcomes support in rebuilding a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not receive support from the countries that sponsor conditional support and civil war.
Europe won in the rider cup of Paris.
In Le Golf National, outside of Paris, France, the United States team has defeated the rider cup for 2018 at its final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States has now recorded six consecutive defeats in fighting in Europe, and has not won in the rider cup since 1993.
In Europe, a team of Danish captain Thomas Bjjön reached a quarter of a point required to defeat the United States and recovered the crown.
U.S. star Phil Mikkelson, who was in most of the tournament, dropped teashots in the pool at the 16th hole of Pur 3 and admitted his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shines on all of his rounds, and has become one out of four players in order to pursue 5-0-0, the current format of the tournament that began in 1979.
America's Jordan Scissor lost 5 and 4 to the lowest player on the European team and to the Danish Tolviéon Alsen.
The world's top players, Dustin Johnson, would have played 2 and 1 in the final battle of the rider cup, to Ian Pauler of England.
The veteran, Sergeo Garcia, who was in the eight-degree rider cup, became the most competitive champion in Europe at the 25.5 career point.
"I don't usually cry, but I don't have time for this today.
It's been a very difficult year.
So I'm grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm really happy to get back the cup.
It's a team, and I'm very happy to be able to contribute.
He is a member of his family, and gave the American golf legend Tiger Woods to John Lamb, who broke 2 and 1 in a single Sunday.
"I have an incredible pride to win Tiger Woods, and I grew up looking at him."
Woods lost at all his games in France and recorded his career in the rider cup record 13-21-3.
The strange statistics of one of the finest players in the world who won the 14 major titles are only Jack Nichols.
Except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, Tony Finnau, the United States team was struggling to find Fairway during the weekend.
America's captain, Jim Freck, spoke after his team's unfortunate performance.
We've talked about Europe this morning.
We fought.
Let's salute Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We're going to reorganize our teams and work together with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I'm so proud to serve as a captain.
You have to throw away your hat.
We've been defeated."
