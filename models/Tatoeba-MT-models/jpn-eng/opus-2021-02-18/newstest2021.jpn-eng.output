Butterler praised Tyler Hero, a young warrior in the future of Hit.
Photo by Getty Image Hit's first game against King's.
In this match, which won 104-98, Duncan Robinson had a team score of 18 points, and Tyler Hero had 15 points and a backcoat.
Robinson, one of the best shooters in the league, is, of course, the 13th choice of the draft, the hero's step up is an important element for the heat.
The hero lost 15 games between February and March due to his ankle injuries and entered the long pause at the Honett War on March 12 when he was back in the war.
The hero said, "There was so much time that I could get back 100% of the order, and I feel the best I've ever felt."
The arrival of Kendrick Nan, the first point guard, increased the hero's running time and preserved his chances.
It's worth a lot.
Jimmy Butler, a team leader, once again praised the hero for his ‘honey’ hero.
"He's got a handler, he can get a score, he can get a fence, he can do anything for the team, because it's not the idea of Luke, he's watching the video, he's researching where his teammates are going and he's trying to figure out where they're going and how they're going to be free and how they're going to be able to do it."
Before the opening of this season, Butler has a love for the strength of his hero's rooky and his stymicked attitude towards basketball.
That's why I've invited you to practice with me at 4 a.m. and I've trained with you.
Butler once said, "He speaks his opinion to no one, and he doesn't back off."
That Butler is the type of person who always says what he thinks, knowing that a collision will happen for the team.
In the past, it has also made our relationship with our teammates worse.
Butler must be giving his hero a day's worth.
The nature of Butler's personality, which is too intense for teammates, is a good guide for those who have enough guts to come to it.
If the relationship between two mutually respected mentors spread to the whole team, Heat would be a team that could be a team that could aim higher.
I'm the first person to take the lead in the 2020 summer district high school baseball competition in Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan,

Kashiyama-sama Nakoku failed to provide the last two dead bases opportunity.
▪ Three years, four times.
Two years, Makayama, the first step in gratitude.
It was the fourth year of two summers when he failed.
Isakaka, a Japanese dealer, beat the ball to the left in the first round of the unkilled rampart.
"If you lose three years, you'll be retired immediately, and you want to win.
Last fall, the rails took out fourth.
"The three battles were fought in three years, and held back for two years of strength.
Director Iwada gathered his players at a meeting and told Nain that he had been here for three years and that he was going to be the best member from now on.
Four out of nine stamen settled the main axis in two years.
It's a pity, but it's evidence of a serious fight.
"From now on, he's going to raise his opponent's level, and he's going to send the runner back."
Six times, he didn't even follow the second base in the game. He showed his three-year-old ego.
Number 0 is inspired by two years, three years.
I'm not going to remind you of the rest of the games.
Six of the musicians from Fukushima province are rallying around the world. - Yahoo! News
I'd like to share with the whole world the lively singing of the beach in the middle of the assembly.
A group of 16 musicians from Fukushima province formed a message song.
On his way to recovery from Japan's earthquake and Tokyo's Fukushima nuclear accident, he wrote a song about Fukushima province's impressive performances fighting the new Volona virus.
We will finish the full edition by the summer of the decade of the earthquake.
On 204 days, I released the song on YouTube.
The song is called "Pray from Fukushima."
I'm going to introduce the positive attitude of the people to melodi in a cheerful and cheerful manner:
Because of the new brand of Colorado, the live house, which is the center of musical activity, has been turned into a business, and many musicians have lost their place in singing and playing.
It's only when you can’t see the future, that you can believe the power of music, that singer Naappo (46) from the south, and DZU-O (37) from the "Mechical Boys" group in the city of Xiao.
Napoo is a writer and writer, Dazo is in charge of rap.
As the project began in March of the Kocona disaster, one after the other, singer MNAMI (28) from Fukushima city, Manami-san, agreed with one another and quickly spread the circle.
Mr. Napoo says in an unannounced way, "I want to enjoy this opportunity."
There was no opportunity for 16 people to come together for the infection, and each recorded in a live house or at home.
In an effort to support the project, Kunihito's artist painted an image character.
It goes through Fukushima and represents a natural climate of blue and green.
The finished song is released to the world on YouTube.
Next year, after ten years of the earthquake, the Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to be held.
Dazo said, "It's a great thing that we've been through so much, that we're carrying a great deal, and I'm glad that many people are encouraging us by publishing the song in the paragraph."
Other musicians joined by the following:

Net information quickly detected a crisis. JBPC (JBPress) - Yahoo! News
"I want to know where the disaster and accident occurred!"
This is not only news media, television and newspapers, but it's also a strong need for many companies, such as social infrastructure companies and government.
So, we're going to talk about what we're going to do in the next video.
A team of experts from Spekty will determine whether social media information is true or false.
Now, the first way people know about disasters and accidents is from TV to online information.
Social media, such as Twitter, has become an important media outlet for information immediately after disaster or accident.
It's hard to do it by hand, but it's always watching the flood of information and extracting useful information from it.
Spekty detects and analyzes natural disasters and accidents from social media information such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and has the ability to pass them on to our companies by determining the true nature of the information.
“A wide range of negative impacts”—the CEO of the village’s Cemetery Committee—a crisis-management service that visualizes various national and domestic crises.
NHK was the first major use of Spekti during the Kakuma earthquake in April 2016, after which the adoption movement spread rapidly among businesses.
More than 350 companies in the country, including television stations and newspapers, as well as companies supporting social infrastructure such as power, gas, and transportation, and governments across the country, are now using Specchti.
▪ parse the post and determine the type of crisis and where it came from
Spekty delivers information through four steps: collecting information, analysis and content classification, title, and false judgment.
Use companies presuppose critical categories (such as disasters and accidents) where information is collected (such as city districts or municipalities).
We're going to use the Google App Engine site to collect posts that are appropriate for that site, using the APls provided by social media.
And then we're going to go through the text, the images, the videos, and we're going to go through the text in the collected posts.
For example, if there's a fire truck in the building and there's black smoke coming up from the building and orange flame coming out of the room, we're going to classify it as a fire.
In addition, if you're in a car, if you're in a car, if you're in a car, if you're on a water-covered road, you're classified as a road cap.
Spekty also estimates where disasters and accidents occur.
"I don't know where the post is coming from, so I'm guessing it's a combination of information."
For example, if you see street signs or signs in your images or videos, you can extract local names from it and match them to your location database.

The Great Valley between the two and the tributaries became a touchout.
After that, Angel fell to two dead bases, and last time, 8 Simmons fell to Nigoro.
In the background, Engels is a dead man and a three-part pin.

Japanese "cold Chinese" doesn't sound like Chinese.
"The Cold Sung" (modern business) - Yahoo! News
The Chinese are cold. The Chinese are "Sunday Snooze."
As mentioned at the outset, cold Chinese is a Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese dish, based on China's cool side (Ryanbanmien / Cold Mix).
So even though it doesn't exist in China originally, it's starting to look like Japanese food stores in the summer, because of the diversity of food.
Also recently, Japanese conveniences include “Sunday’s coolness/cold Chinese” and “Correction” as well.
On the other hand, the popularity of Chinese Chinese food is not generally high in China, being pushed by popular punches such as Miyagi and Lake Lake.
Of course, the flavoring of Chinese Chinese Chinese food is often familiar.
So it's not a bad taste, but it tends to be highly criticized when the impact is low.
Cold China is not an exception, and is still a minor in China.
In China, the name for the cold Chinese is "Sunday Snooze."
Chinese are recognized as part of Japanese food.
It's a summer rule.
In China, when it comes to a bowl of summer, it's a cool skin.
Many of you may not be familiar with Japan, but the soft skin is made of wheat flour, rice flour and denun.
It's said to be 2,000 years old.
It's a set of B-class gullies that are sold in the store, and the price is 10 to 20 .00, and it's a lot of leisnavres.
It has the word "cold," but it doesn't end up in the ice like a cold Japanese Chinese.
It's not that cold is the basic thing.
Add the flavors of cucumbers, carrots, palm oils, and other ingredients, such as peppers, peppers, peppers, carrots and garlic.
Finally, it is completed with a special seasoning mixed with succulent oil, lau oil, vinegar, linen paste and peanut paste.

The benefits of cold showers on the body and heart - Yahoo!
I'm going to try to stop this from happening.
A study of the effectiveness of hydrotherapy, published in The North American Journal of Medicine, found that there is hope for a physical and mental healing effect.
He says he can reduce muscle pain and other burning effects by being exposed to cold water after exercise.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, director of the University of Connecticut's School of Sports Medicine, director of the study of sports medicine, and a teacher at Connecticut University, it is important to exercise and shower with cold water without having to give as much time as possible.
I'm going to reduce my fatigue.
Exercises in high temperatures usually require more blood flow from the heart, muscles, and skin.
"The higher the heart rate during exercise, the more blood flow to the heart, the more blood flow to the heart, the more blood flow to the muscle, and the more blood flow to the skin to regulate body temperature."
"You can reduce the amount of blood flow to your skin by taking a cold shower, so you can reduce the amount of blood flow to your skin, and instead you can send blood to your intestines and other internal organs, which make it easier for you to take in water and nutrients after exercise.
Holmism effect expected
Drosevsky also explains that by pouring cold water, we can expect the "holmismis effect" to be triggered.
The idea is that there's a little bit more harm to the body than there is at all.
"The low oxygen movement, dieting, and cold showers are examples of what we can expect for the formalism effect for health.

The last two games that followed Hiroshima on the 23rd day were a time for a fight to be fought back.
It was worth a shot from someone you didn't like.
"When you're fighting on the 7th, it's a four-point score.
But only the Nagoyaya dome, with two games of the past, allowed the Seven Wins, held, and suffered seven defeats from August 23, 2003.
From such a difficult enemy, the Nagoya Dome took 23 innings (and the board is counting on Inning) with a wild shot and never gave the game its way.

On the 25th of the year, Iwaki Iwai Iwai Iwai (HC), the leader of Japan's 7-year-old, announced his determination to "unify the Tokyo Olympics that were postponed next year" and "to win medals for the goal."
With the delay of the five-fold delays, the Koka-Cola and Fukushi, the 9-year World Cup leader, have left the team.
"Of course, the impact is great, but we can fight together and move forward."
From this day on, the team has launched the candidates' dormitories in large sections with Tokyo.
The sleeping quarters will be held until the 28th of March and will not be conducted by contact practice as a anti-infectious measure of the new corona virus.
The delegates have decided to return to the top group that will be available for all seven World Cups from next year, but because the World War itself is not clear enough, Iwai HC has been able to narrow down his opponent to the country where he is allowed to enter the country and negotiate a stronger match.
"Medical workers" are being infected in Nagano, the first 40-year-old woman of the Red Cross Hospital (NBS) to run the PCR scans on all her contacts.

I'm a staff member at the Red Cross Hospital.
The infection was confirmed by a woman in her 40s.
We have 87 people infected in the province, and we're the first medical staff.
According to the province, women were treated with three medical institutions after coughing and vomiting on the 13th.
I was admitted on 23rd, 24 days, and I found out I was positive.
It's a mild condition.
And that's what we're talking about.
We're currently working on the path of infection.
The Red Cross hospital, where the women worked, announced that there was an infected employee on the 24th.
We don't have an "intensive contact" in the hospital, but we're going to run a PCR test on all our contacts and shut down the wards and detoxify them completely.
Macao Casino's administrators are looking at the state of the prevention measures in the casinos... and are required to present a new form of Corona's anti-viral certificate during entry. - Macao! News!
About 40 casinos in Macao have resumed their operation on strict anti-pollution measures since February 5 to 19.
The Macao Casino Control Authority (DICJ) has called for the maximum protection of employees and guests' health to resume their company, secure the distance between the casino tables, open their seats in a table game (for example, three or four people can sit at one table at the same time) and set for slot machines one or two initiatives, and the risk of crossing the border is reduced.
The anti-vention against devices such as chips has also been implemented.
The guests are also required to present a proposal to wear a mask, a temperature, a good health code (a recent stay with a new corona patient, not a history of exposure, not a symptom of fever or cough, or a combination of contacts) when entering.
From 0 a.m. on July 15th, the proposals for a new form of coronavirus necrosis (only within the active period of Macao or Guangzhou's legal facilities) were added.
In the context of the new mandatory presentation of negative certificates, from 6 A.M. to 15 A.M., there is a reduction of water measures between Macao and Canton province (the 14-day quarantine of quarantine), and the conditions are the following precautions:
DICJ announced on July 18, that after changing its entry conditions from July 15, the director of the agency, Ariano Ho, has taken a look at the situation in the prevention measures at the casino, has called for a meeting of six casino-run security departments, and has asked them to protect the health of employees and guests by taking full control of their entrances.
DICJ will continue its strict patrolling of casino facilities, will provide regular meetings with management companies as quickly as possible, and will also follow the government's health guidelines to ensure protection measures at the casino.
The inspection of the casino facilities has also been accompanied by the head of the Center for Disease Control and Disease Control, who has been instructed on how to detoxify gambling chips and how to make safe distances between electronic and casino equipment.
In addition, due to the sharp decline in the number of Invading Travelers, including the border limits, the sales of casinos this year have been at 3.37.2 billion macao takat (approximately US$4.6 billion) since the same period of the year.
I'm going to send a message to the medical staff next month from the hot springs to the Ale of Light, instead of the wild festival.
As a result of the new form of the Corona virus, the initiative will begin at the hot springs, which have been suspended every year by the annual “water-flowing festival”, to support health workers since August.
The country's fans and locals have written some 350 sheets of paper, which are wrapped around the town of Ale, which is filled with light and healing for visitors.
A wild festival is an event that recreates the festival in which "flowers bloom" modeled by hot springs are organized by the Hot Springs Tourism Society.
Starting in '20, the year when the cartoons were broadcast, there are a lot of fans coming from all over the country every year.
Every day from the lighting ceremony in July to the March celebration, we light them up on the stairs leading up to the Yucatan shrine.
This year the festival has been canceled for the new corona, but local and national fans have been calling out to me, "I miss it so much in the summer of the spring."
I called it the "Ricaly campaign" because I wanted to help heal and recover the suffering of the Corona disaster.
So far, we have had about 50 students on the lawn write illustrated messages one by one, and more than 00 applications from around the country.
The message form can be purchased from the Society's website, filled out and sent to the Society in reply envelopes, where it can be received with lighted pictures placed on the bush.
"I accept an application for six thousand yen to reach about 350 junkyards.
I'm going to light up the junk till the end of the month.
Yamamoto-san, the first president of the festival from the beginning, said, "When we read the message, we will also be encouraged to celebrate the 0th anniversary of the festival next year."
For the campaign, he also drew characters and illustrations of Asano River.
"From day to day, I present to you a clear file illustrated by a special host of guest planners at the hot springs.
It's called the "East Spokane of the Forest" (East Spokane).
It is the second time this year's goodbyes have been won.
On the 24th, Lotte's battle was two, two, nine times, not far from the start, four of them showed their commitment to victory.
The head-slaying is the lead from safety vandals to first base.
And so here's the 6th match, the rate of "8/2" and the third forest at the bottom of the storm, which decided to send vandals to the base.
The 4th Mountain has been held back, and the other island, which has returned from this day to its fifth forest, has been destroyed and brought to a three-two victory.
The hero, I thought, "I have no choice but to get caught up in a bench, and I have no choice but to take care of it.
The second-year draft, the second-year draft, the third-year draft, the third-year mountain range, and the fourth-year-old Nagata.
They've all had the experience of generals in the amateur era, and they're equally responsible.
Kobazaki, who took over the captain from Yamakawa during the 4th year of Fuji, says, "Captain Yamakawa is a good talker and he pulls the team out of words, but I'm too dumb to speak, and I'm the type of person who's standing behind me."
I thought I'd be able to do it, but I thought I'd be able to do it.
Four of them are now suffering from 20 to 50 minutes of the beating, but they are supporting the team with wisdom if they cannot.

Corona's "HASARD" (Daily North-East newspaper) - Yahooo News
It's a museum where you can touch your art whenever you want.
They range from famous painters, such as Claude Monet and Gustave Klimt, to unknown artists in the country.
The online museum "HASARD" has attracted users from its convenience and freshness since April 2019, and has raised awareness of the new way of life by the Corona disaster.
"Everyone wanted to create a service that could be easily enjoyed by art, under difficult circumstances I want to touch art."
When we visit Aza, we are surprised by the richness of the exhibition and the beauty of the images.
As of 24 days ago, 14 exhibitions of permanent exhibitions and projects are being held, attracting observers to see not only color but also high resolution works that reach the quality of the brush.
It is not necessary to register members or pay for entry fees, nor is it expensive for artists who want to open their own exhibitions.
If you're online, you'll be more interested in how you show it.
It's one thing to move a picture.
Claude Monet's permanent exhibition begins to move again, digitally processing clouds, flowers, meadows, and so forth.
"I want to make art accessible to people who are less interested in art."
It's called "The Man's Hand" and "The Man's Hand."
At the time, when I and my family visited the newly completed Aomori State Museum, I was shocked by the impact of the three giant paintings of Mark Shagahl's "Aleco".
The next day, art classes changed in a good time, and after I got to college, I was able to move to the gallery and so forth.
At the same time, a large exhibition with no museums near it felt that many people had little opportunity to interact with art in different ways, such as holding the capital area and being able to raise children and go out hard.
So I spent about two months working with IT companies and created a site where art can be appreciated online.
The number of users reached 10,000 per month in the first ten months, and has increased to about 30,000 after the spread of the new corona.
If anyone can see art in a free form...
Aza's aim was to be accepted by more and more people without considering the corona disaster.
The Manjino representative emphasizes that it enhances his imagination on the meaning of artistic awareness.
"When your imagination is rich, you can reach out to those in need.
I want to be a better society because art is so close.
The end of the Chinese age, a simple reason for Japan's age of quality.
Change of values with pandemics.
There are many predictions and discussions about the world of Akhtar Pandemic.
In business, the "Managing Jobs" article is now disappearing in Japan. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Japan's strength is what only Japanese people don't know.
And it is estimated that the trend will be mainstream to give to a person who has become conscious of the end of his life in Corona, to Corona on June 10, and to see the effect of the ‘God in Times of Distress’ now.
And it seems to us that these two "matters" (economic business) and "spirits" will become visible to us as a combination, but the great flow of "from Chinese to Japanese quality" is that.
For example, if there's a bad defect in a T-shirt or a serious shark, it's annoying.
On the other hand, the recent Chinese mask and the awkward quality of the respirator... the Chinese quality of such life and safe products is fatal.
You can't buy a product like that, no matter how cheap it is.
He's going to ask for a Japanese quality product, even at a significant price.
Of course, this is not just happening in Japan.
The lack of masks and medical equipment makes it clear that Western countries, in difficult situations, still went on to do “returns” to the point of “Chinese quality” too much.
Safer than cheap.
And cars and other products can also be fatally defective.
No matter how many countries, including countries like Japan, have come under attack with the low-cost strategy of “Peace or Bad”, it is still successful in Japan’s production and June 16 articles, and the world's auto manufacturers have won on their own, do they bow down to Toyota?
And this Pandemic reminded us that many other products also need “safety and security.”
Safety and security are important not only in making Japan's quality of production but also in its quality of service, such as flow.
It's like toilet paper disturbances, but sometimes it's too late to reach them.
It also made me feel that the key element of "safety" in Japan is self-sufficient, like the article "Who Really Is the Muscovite?" on April 17!
Every country has its own priorities in life, and it is very important that it be able to provide essentials in its own country, such as masks and food.
South Korea's new-infected Corona, at 115 days and 100 more – 86 of them – Yahoo! News
South Korea's Central Center for Disease Control announced that today’s number of new corona viruses has increased from 0 a.m. to 113 a.m. and an average of 10,40922.

It has been found that white paint from Tefron frying pans, and a fever can increase the air-conditioning effect!
I don't believe you've found anything!
This year was a rainy season with an unprecedented amount of rainfall.
It's a hot, hot, even cold, hot day.
It's a global problem, and we've been trying to figure out how to get through the hot summer with a little comfort.
One way to do that is to wear a thin, white garment.
You know, you don't have to wear black clothes that absorb heat in summer.
So we're going to use the same principles as we did in the construction of the house.
It's not possible that white is white, but it's more light-like, so it's not made into a kind of paint that doesn't absorb heat, and that's where the most recent study is.
Recently, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) University of California, Hery Sameli Square of Energy and Applicated Sciences, along with researchers at Columbia University’s applied physics and applied maths department, announced a combination of white paints that can restore solar heat more efficiently and increase the cooling effect of the building.
It's supposed to be an early practice.
So far, the highest amount of solar radiation has been reflected by the nitric oxides, which reach 85% of the reflected light.
White paints that already use nitrous oxide are applied to the roof of buildings in high-heated environments, and are used to block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
The new discovery, however, is a white paint derived from polytelefluoroethylene (PTFE) .
This is a white paint that uses the Teffron effect.
In the hot summers, it's easier to stay in the house without the heat because of the unexpected white paint used by Teflon.
Maybe that's the time that's coming, right?
The roof of the Japanese house seems to be full of dark colors.
Amazon's annual sales, when's this year's event?
On July 21, the U.S. CNBC reported that the U.S. Amazon Dot Com had revealed a delay in the annual major sale “prime day”:

Prime Day has been held around the world, but this year, it may be an unusual step.
▪ In 2015, the Amazon launched a large sales campaign for its members in an effort to promote sales of less expensive summers.
It was originally a 24-hour event, which took place every year in 18 countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, Australia, and the United States.
According to the company last year, sales of two days exceeded the sales record of "Black Friday" and "Viromanday" (Sunday).
The event also contributed to the acquisition of new members of the prime staff, who last year were the most popular in the first day, and the following day.
We're also told that we sold 150 million goods in the world last year.
In this regard, an Internet journal on the Internet reported that the total worldwide sales of two days increased by 716 million (U.S.) in the previous year, an increase of 70 percent.

What about your fee, your point-of-point grant?

The Ministry of State has been working on a review of the transition system (MNPP) where traditional phone numbers can be used to change the mobile phone company.
In the 21st day, an expert conference offered a policy to amend the MNP's guidelines in 2004.
There's a lot of specifics, including how to charge MNPs and how to pull them out of the country.
The reaction from communications companies is expected to attract attention to whether or not it can lead to a healthy market competition.
In the early years of '06, when the dark MNPs were introduced, the cost of users was 2000 yen, but now it's 3,000 yen.
MNP's fee for three major mobile communications firms is estimated to be up to $19.5 billion a year.
On the 21st, the Ministry listed the status of the MNP in the "WG" (WG) group on the testing of the rules of competition that discuss such things as the competition environment in the communications market.
It was time to issue the MNP reservation number that consumers needed to move to other communications companies.
While major news agencies are accepting it on the web, the time period is 9 to 20 hours in the mainstream due to the convenience of the core system.
The WG document clearly states that the direction of discussion will be based on all day's events.
It is also a problem for those who wish to move to the MNP, and for those whose mobile phone companies are giving them points.
Overreach could interfere with the fair competition.
The one partner of the WG member of the Namura Institute of Commons says, "Can you give us time to explain the economic benefits, get permission from our users, and quickly issue a number to those who are not allowed to do so, and suggest that it is important to get this process done first."
In a series of proposals, however, the higher the MNP fee, the more likely the customer will be to spill, and the more likely the incentive to lower it will be.
If there are entrepreneurs who lower the MNP fee first, the company also increases the flow of customers and is also concerned that their efforts are not rewarded.
The Ministry of State has pointed out that many countries abroad do not want to charge people for MNPs, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan.
The Ministry of State wants to put together the results of the WG as a report about 9 to October and then start the process of changing the MNP guidelines.
When changes are made, the period is expected to be 21 years.
Mobile communications will be troubling you, including how to sell and support customers.
Middle and middle, Katsuno, with six points missing, without the right to be the winner.
Middle-day Katsuno-san (23) is the first to fight the 8th of Osaka.
Six times I lost my mark.

The director of Katsuya Nakajima's Hospital explained such things as Draiaiai.
The Health Seminar, which experts advise on health problems, was released on the 25th day at Johnsawa Nagata, Japan's town of Saga.
The director of Katsuya Nakajima's Eye Center explained the diseases that are deeply related to life, such as dry eyes and cataracts:
Draeye is said to be “the disease of tears” and explains that tears break down and tears never cross the surface of the eye.
"It's easy for contact lenses to be about four times more easily used," he warned, "do not use them for long periods of time and don't sleep on them."
They have taken measures to put the computer's screen below the eye's height and wet in rooms where air conditioners work.
I've also mentioned ingredients and food that have an effect on dry eyes.
"The Omega 3 among the blue fish prevented the burst of tears, and the ‘min’, which is so abundant in nattos and okra, raised the quality of the tears.
In the case of cataract surgery, there's a single focus and a multiple focus on the eye lens that inserts it instead of the crystalline material.
About 40 people participated in the seminar.
In an effort to prevent the spread of the virus, a small group opened in two parts of the morning and afternoon to monitor the presence, detoxify, and provide adequate ventilation.

The 27-year-old, who was also inspired by the 4th district convention in the summer of her school, smiled as expected, "I felt good."
They called him "the man who doesn't have it."
He was chosen as the athlete for the interior and the field, and contributed to the world's greatest contribution last month in "Premium 2".
But in the West, he had no experience with good-byes, and he didn't have a coach, or a stable guard, or a base coach.
In return for his negative reputation, he won his second bid this year.
He said, "I asked the goddess of victory to ask for one today, and she did it well."
You're saving two, top-of-the-soft and third-stage game.
This year, it's still time to say, "It's just a base strike, and the rate of impact, 252 out of the world, is still going to be the next win, and we're going to be on our team."

A pig pig “to raise about 50,000 pigs a year” on a farm in the city of Nagasaki and Siyata, Japan, went to the mayor of Japan on 20 days and reported that his farm had obtained a "JGAP" (health and livestock products) to show the safety of livestock.
