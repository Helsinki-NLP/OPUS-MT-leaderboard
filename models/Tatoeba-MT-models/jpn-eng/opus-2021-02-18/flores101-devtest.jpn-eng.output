A former Filipino police officer is hijacking a bus in the Philippines' capital, Manila, and holding tourists in Hong Kong hostage.
Roland Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued, but so far, at least six people have been killed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early and Filipino photographers were also released.
The photographers were replaced by elderly women who wanted to go to the dirt, and the suspect Mendoza was shot.
Riggins took over his father's trail and went to medical school.
He was trained as a obstetrician and began working at a National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins used his spare time to study early births.
He found that the hormone given causes the fetus to mature faster.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders from the Black Box on Wednesday.
We've been doing this for a long time.
And I'm going to show you some examples of this, and Tommy Dreammer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Ecstream, and she was my first manager.
"Dastin Goldcasts" Laners commented that "Luna was as unusual as I am... or even more... and I love her and I miss her... if I can't find her, I want her to be in heaven."
In a poll of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal elections, there was an 8% increase in opposition to Australia's republic.
The Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued that when Queen Elizabeth II's reign was over in the 2010 elections, Australia should move to the union.
In the poll, 34% agreed, and they hope Queen Elizabeth II is Australia's last monarch.
A poll shows 29% of those who think Australia should be a republic as soon as possible, 31% of those who think it shouldn't be a republic, and 31% of those who think it shouldn't be.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim 100 meters, 200 meters, and three relays in a common game.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to control the pain because it was banned at the convention.
On January 25, Professor Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number of prime numbers ever known.
This discovery was made by a few people using different hardware and software by early February, and it was released on Tuesday.
The comet could form proteins, carry life support organic material, and provide water for the Earth.
Scientists want to understand how planets have been formed and especially how they have been formed since comets collided with the Earth some time ago.
Qomo, 53 years old, signed a bill earlier this year for Governorship, last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called this rumor "political chatter and foolishness."
It's been estimated that we're going to be running for the presidential election in 2016.
The FAA claims that the system allows aircraft to fly across short-range lines so that they can save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
We're using satellite technology that contrasts with conventional ground radar technology so that controllers can pinpoint aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to the pilot.
There are no special transportation systems, no ground trains stop in Wembley, no parking lots and park-and-raised facilities on the ground.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the team's supporters will be forced to fight in closed spaces.
In a study published in the journal Science on Thursday, it was reported that new species of birds were born in the Gal√°pagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that this new species evolved in just two generations, but it was thought that this process was much longer because of the breeding of a specific species, Gal√°pagos Finch, and a new species of ostrophy.
Gold is a metal that can be molded into any shape.
So if you were to draw it like this, you could draw it like a wire, you could twist it, you could weave it.
So, if you want, you can paste it very thinly and then paste it into another metal.
This is called the chemical pH.
The juice of cabbage reacts to chemicals, depending on acidity or alkalinity.
The PH level is measured by the amount of hydrogen ions (H of pH) in the tested chemicals.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have been removed from the atom.
I'm going to put two pieces of dry powder together, and I'm going to hold them in my clean, wet hands.
The water on your hand reacts to the outer layer, and it feels strange, and it forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Haraper and Mohenjodaro, there were sewers, and almost all houses had toilets.
The remains of sewers have been found in the homes of the cities of Mina in Crete and Santo Lini in Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China.
So, if you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you'll automatically get a satellite call.
The satellite in space picks up the call and reflects it almost instantly.
And the reason why we use telescopes in space is because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and landscapes that enter the human eye.
We need a rocket over 100 feet high to launch and deploy satellites and telescopes into space.
This wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing that this wheel has brought us is to make transportation much more comfortable and faster.
It's a very simple way of doing it.
Under them, many of the midget cats eat the midgets, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are numerous small cats (including feral cats) that feed on much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to success is that each cat has a special job and does not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats and live in a large group called pride.
It's about pride. It's about pride. It's about pride.
Usually, the females are related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
The pride of lions is similar to that of wolves and dogs.
It's a very balanced body, and it's able to climb, swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a human being.
The tiger belongs to the lion, the leopard, the jaguar, the leopard.
The tiger is not a lion-like scream, it's more like an overwhelming threat.
Ocelot likes small animals, and they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can.
Scientists believe Ocelot will seek out places where prey can smell the ground and prey.
They're very good at night vision, and they're very good at moving around.
If a small group of living things were to leave their large population (for example, moving across mountains and rivers or moving back to a new island) then you would often find that they are in a different environment.
In this new environment, there are different competitors with different resources, so a new group needs different characteristics and adapts and can become a powerful rival.
The original population is not changing at all, and it still needs to adapt as it did in the past.
So, as we start to adapt to the new environment, as time goes on, we start to look different from other groups.
It's going to look something like this.
We call this process a seed formation, but this simply means formation of a new species.
And that's what plants are doing.
So, if you look at the Sun, you can see that plants make their food from the Sun by means of photogenesynthesis.
We make houses out of plants, we make clothes out of plants, many of the food we eat every day is plants, and without plants, animals cannot live.
Since the Mossasaurus was the top predator of its time, there was no one else to fear but the Mossasaurus.
So if you look at this, you'll see that there are more than 70 sharp teeth in its long jaws, and there's no way out.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a two-width tongue at the end.
It will attack anything that comes into the water, and it will not attack a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus.
Most of their food is familiar to us.
Another difference is that poor people and women sit in chairs and eat, while rich men like to eat at banquets where they sleep and relax.
Ancient Roman food could not have been brought in from America and Asia to Europe during the next centuries.
So there's no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cola, no ancient Romans who tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built the first temple for each of their gods, and it was considered a house of the gods.
The people sacrificed sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to fulfill the gods' wishes through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard after which only the priests could enter.
It's a temple. It's a temple. It's a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
Houses were not so important to the people living in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family lived mostly out of the house.
We had women cooking in the garden, and the shops were all just street stalls.
The timber was very expensive and valuable because there was no massive forest in the land of Canaan.
Greenland was an unfamiliar region, according to a northern European legend, when Aleik was expelled from Iceland for murder and when he headed west, he discovered Greenland and was named Greenland.
But regardless of what he found, the Eskimos already lived there.
Although each country is "Sundian," there were significant differences in the national character, the monarchy, the culture and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland.
So, this is what we're going to do.
But it wasn't. Something on the back was not a treasure map.
So, the first thing that was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence was the title of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.
We don't know who wrote it.
So it's just a label.
In the D-day landing and the fighting that followed, the northern part of France had not been released yet.
The French were the French of the Vichy, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and helped the invaders rather than fight the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and its invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the U.S. and the Free Frances were freeing South France and headed for Germany.
It is a culture, a society shared by a large community of co-workers.
The word civilization comes from the Latin adjective cvilis, which means citizen, or citizen, or city or city state, or cavitas, that define the scale of society in some way.
The city state is the front of the state, civilization is the heritage of several generations of knowledge, the survival of cultural footprints, the spread of justice.
A culture that is out of the mainstream often disappears without being recognized as a formal civilization, leaving no historical evidence.
During the independent war, 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the Union agreement, and Congress was the only component of it.
The parliament did not have the authority to tax, and all the actions of the state were directed to the state authorities because there were no state enforcement agencies or judicial agencies, but the state authorities were often uncooperative.
We didn't have the authority to disable state tax laws and customs.
The amendment required a consensus from all states, but each state ignored the central government and often missed its representatives.
The Italian soccer team is the world's second best team, winning the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
I'm going to show you a few examples.
Winter sports are popular in the northern regions, with Italian players in international competitions and in the Olympics.
There are about 7,000 islands in Japan, the largest of which is the main island in the world.
So let's say we have a group of islands.
It began in the 15th century when European sailors called the island 'Ilha Formosa'.
In 1624, a Dutch East Indian company founded in the southwest of Taiwan, transformed the way the indigenous people produced their grain, hired Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army occupied the western and northern coasts of Taiwan in 1644 and declared Taiwan to be the Ministry of the United States in 1885.
After the defeat of the First World War in 1895 (1894-1895), the Japanese government signed the Convention and handed Taiwan's sovereignty over to Japan.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the sun clock, the temple of the sun, and the temple of the three windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex are rebuilt so tourists can see more of the traditional landscape.
The machu Picchu was restored to 30 percent by 1976 and continues to be restored.
For example, the film format of the world's most widespread still photography is 35 mm, which by the end of the Analog film era was the mainstream film size.
It's still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect is that it inherits the image sensor format of digital cameras.
So let's think about it.
So we're saying that the simplest ratio of 12 to 12 is 3:2.
The general record format (e.g. an APS document form) is similar or closer to this aspect of the aspect.
It's a very simple way to create dynamics while maintaining video order.
The most effective position to place the main subject is where the image is surrounded by a line that is divided vertically and by a third.
The Catholic Church, which has become economically rich and powerful in European history, had a hard eye at this time.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united different European countries with different languages and customs.
Its universal power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are special for it.
The central power of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and funds has caused many to question whether its doctrine is satisfied.
Soon after the act of aggression began, the British launched a seal on the sea against Germany.
The strategy was effective and prevented the supply of important military and civilian goods, which violated international laws that were developed and generally recognized by international agreements in the past two centuries.
Britain has planted lightning in the open sea to prevent ships from entering the entire ocean, and has even threatened the USSR.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected the same reaction to the unlimited water war.
The idea that spread to most citizens and nations in the 1920s was pacifism and isolationism.
After experiencing the misery and cruelty of the war during World War I, the nations hoped not to face it again in the future.
It's called "The New York Times" and it's called "The New York Times."
I sent it to America with a book of poems and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of showing the age difference, where each stage or family in China's history became a distinctive dynasty.
There was also a period of instability in each dynasty, divided into parts of the region, and the best known of these is the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between Han and Zhi.
In these times, many noblemen fought hard for the throne.
It was one of the bloodiest times in ancient China's history when thousands of warriors fought in the struggle to achieve the highest palace in West Korea.
The adoption of the metric system, the transition from absoluteism to totalitarianism, patriotism, and the belief that the country is not a single ruler but a nation's.
After the revolution, employment became a public service and all men were qualified to apply for it, and those who were most willing and successful got it.
The same thing is true in the military, because it's not a class of troops, it's a class of abilities.
The French Revolution inspired many of the oppressed working classes in other countries, and revolutions started in different countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond his daily life, and he used to come to the cave called "Healah" on the mountains of Noor" to meditate.
The cave that has passed through the ages is a vivid picture of Muhammad's mental dedication.
The cave is on the mountaintop north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
It's actually not easy to find a cave even if you know it exists.
You can't see anything but the clear sky above you and the many mountains around you.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that exists in the Seven Wonders.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of the many pyramid buildings built to support the dead Pharaoh.
In the Giza Heights, which extends to the valley of the dead in Egypt, there are many pyramids, many small tombs, temples, and great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is a huge tomb in honor of King Farao Kukh, surrounded by small pyramids, tombs, and temples, many of which honor the king‚Äôs wife and family.
So, we're going to look at the angle of the raised bow, and the bow mark looks like V characters.
Up is to start with the bow, and down is to pull the bow first.
The bow is usually softer, the bow is stronger, and the bow produces a controversial sound.
I'm going to write it in a pencil, but I'm going to write it in a pencil, but I'm going to remind you that there's a musical reason why the written bows match.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XIV, the Queen Marie Antwerp, and two young children (11 years old Marie Terrez and Louis Charles), and the king's sister Elizabeth, were forced to leave the Palace of Versais to Paris by women who became a mob.
They went back to Paris surrounded by mobs shouting at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the window of the carriage.
Once, in front of the frightened queen, one of the mobs shook the heads of the royal guard who was killed in the Palace of Versaiil.
The Filipinos paid for the conquest of the Philippines in an American imperial war.
They were forced to pay interest on bonds that had been sold in the name of the Filipino government through Wall Street banks, to pay the bulk of their expenses by pre-taxing taxes to the American colonial regime and by means of Wall Street banks.
Of course, the excess income derived from long-term exploitation of Filipinos would have been the basic benefit of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights of Temple, we need to understand the context in which that order originated.
The time of this event is called the Middle Ages, and is generally the 11th century, the 13th century, the 13th century, in European history.
It is customary to think that the Middle Ages was a period of time in the history of the Middle Ages between the latter part of the Middle Ages and the latter part of the Middle Ages ended by 1500.
Technology decision theory is a term that really embraces a broad range of ideas, starting with technology promotions and technical norms, and the exact meaning that human fate is driven by logic at the root of the scientific law and its reality in technology.
One is the fact that technology's development in itself goes beyond cultural and political impacts; the other, it's not the social requirement; it's the effect on the inner society; it's the effect on the inner society.
And that's what we're talking about.
But just a handful of cars aren't able to make a national road net, so we're developing a new way of producing cars to reduce the cost of owning cars.
The increase in car ownership leads to increased road accidents, and as a result, new technologies are developed in the medical field to treat injured bodies.
It's not just that. It's that. It's not that.
In the context of romanticism, geography formed an individual, and through time came the customs and cultures of its geography, which were better than the laws imposed on it.
As Paris is known in the modern world as the center of fashion, Constantinople was the center of fashion in constipated Europe.
Its fame began around 400 B.C. and continued until about 1100 B.C.
In the 12th century, the presence of the Crusaders dropped largely because they returned with gifts such as silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market.
It was then that the name as the center of fashion moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The best time of the Gothic style was between 10 and 11th centuries and 14th century.
The original dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
But because of the slow route of communication, Western styles may be 25 or 30 years behind.
In the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a form of agriculture that produces only enough food for both farmers and their families.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple system that maximizes the capacity of the stored seeds in the ecosystem, combined with ringmaking and other relatively simple technologies, and is often organic agriculture.
Historically, most farmers are self-sufficient farmers, and many developing countries still see the trend.
Subculture is a culture where loved ones who feel neglected by the standards of society can gather and develop their own identity.
It's called sub-carcials.
The nature of determining the characteristics of subcultures may be a combination of languages, beauty, religion, politics, geography, or their elements.
The members of the subcultures often represent themselves as part of a symbolic style that includes fashion, mannerism, and language.
One of the most common ways used to show the importance of socialization is to deal with the fewer unfortunate cases of children who have grown up and been prevented by the abuse of child care, bad luck, or otherwise.
Children like this are sometimes called "wild children" or "Falalling Kid." Wild children are sometimes held captive by people (usually their own parents).
Wild children may experience severe abuse and trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Some are said to be raised by animals, others to live on their own in the wild.
The wild animals that have grown up in non-human animals show almost the same behavior (in physical areas) as they do, such as fear of man and indifference towards human beings.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
So, this is not a method of learning, it's a way of using new computer programs, starting new projects, and supporting new learning experiences.
There's both virtual and real in scafortding, and in other words, teachers are a form of scale falling, and there's a Microsoft Office clipstick.
It's built into this software that's designed to allow students to ask, instruct and explain procedures that they think are hard to do alone.
The reasons why children are placed in foster care range from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
Every child should be raised, cared for, and raised in a well-organized environment, but every wild child grows in an environment where it doesn't exist.
We are aware that the foster system is a safe zone for these children.
The foster system is to provide safe families, loving child care, solid education, and reliable medical care.
The foster system provides all the essentials that were lacking in families before they were taken away.
The Internet is an environment that has both the elements of mass communication and human communication.
It's called the Internet.
It's not just about the Internet, it's about the Internet, it's about the Internet.
The "responsive involvement" and "responsible relationships" were identified as aspects of new motivations when Eighmey & McCord (1998) examined viewers' reactions to the website.
So, this is a video video video.
So, we're saying that the person who is lying is not lying.
Oliver Sacks points out that even those with brain problems who do not understand speech can properly evaluate integrity.
He even suggests that this ability to interpret human behavior is common to animals, such as dog dogs.
So, we're going to look at this in the next video, and we're going to look at the study of the 20th century.
It's a mutation that causes a new genetic mutation, and it can be removed from the pool of the mutation that was produced by the selection.
So, we're going to do a lot of research on how to do this.
It's hard for primates with digestive systems like humans to take in essential amino acids from the plant resources available in the savanna environment.
And if we don't do that, we will end up in serious situations, such as stunting growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources were proteins from leaves and beans, which are hard to digest if you don't cook them.
In the meantime, animal food (the ants, the white ants, the eggs) is a good source of protein, including all the essential amino acids.
And that's what we're talking about here.
I'm going to talk a little bit about sleep.
It's easy to use a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring consciousness back to consciousness without waking up completely.
When we realize that the alarm will be stopped unconsciously, we have to put a watch on the other side of the room to prevent it from happening unless we get out of bed.
Other means, based on biorhythms, are to eat plenty of water before sleep (particularly with water or urine) and make it forced to urinate.
The level of peace in a person's mind is the opposite of the level of tension in the body and the mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force.
It's the only thing that prevents us from doing this is our own anxiety and negative feelings.
Tibetan Buddhism is a belief based on the belief of the Buddha, but it is extended by taking a lot of technology from the Buddha's mercy and yoga in India.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple.
The Kundaliniyoga is a way to awaken the Kundalini by combining yoga pose, breathing, mantra, Modra, etc.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the divine yoga.
In the Second World War, Germany was a common enemy, and it led to Soviet and American cooperation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and eventually the Cold War began.
It was followed by 40 years of real military fighting from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and other battlefields.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defense had already been broken, and our only hope was to retreat along the bridge of Romania and rebuild it.
These plans, however, almost overnight, have been made up of more than 800,000 soldiers in the Soviet Union who have invaded the eastern part of Poland in violation of the Liga Peace Treaty, the Soviet Poland-invasion treaty, and other international treaties.
It's the most efficient way of transporting people and goods across the ocean.
In the past, the Navy‚Äôs job was to maintain its ability to transport its own citizens and goods, and to ensure that its ability to transport enemy citizens and goods was compromised.
The most recent example is the North Atlantic operation of World War II.
And the German Navy was also using U-boats to stop this transport.
If the Allies had been defeated, Germany would probably have conquered England as well as the rest of Europe.
The goat‚Äôs livestock began about 10,000 years ago and is said to be centered in the western part of Iran‚Äôs Zagros Mountains.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to raise goats that were easy to pick up with milk, hair, meat, and skin.
The goats were generally kept in the hills and other pastures, but the goats that cared for the herds were usually boys.
It's not like we're going to see a lot of cars.
It's not like we've been able to do that, but it's not that easy.
The pillows were introduced quite early to secure the line.
It's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
And finally, wooden wheels were replaced by steel wheels.
The first way to move is by walking, and mankind began its upright walk at the time of the emergence of Homo Erex, which is two years ago.
It's not the custom to walk upright for more than a certain period of time.
Sahelantrops may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, but the properties of the two-footed foot are confirmed by the Australopithecus fossil record of 390 to 4.2 million years ago.
You can start a better life, you can join an environmental movement, you can become an activist to reduce some of your future suffering.
In many cases, this is just a form of anti-diagnosing, but we need not only to seek a temporary solution, but also to find the root cause of the problem and to deactivate it.
It is a clear fact that mankind‚Äôs technological advances have greatly changed the world and have expanded the problem because of overpopulation and luxury living.
After the election of President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, the draft of a handwriting signed by Presidents John Hancock and Charles Thompson was sent to the printing of John Dunlap, several blocks away.
So we're going to get 150 to 200 copies per night, and now we're going to call it the Dunlap Broadside.
The first public reading of this document was done on July 8 by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Memorial.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and read to the army in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap Broadsides that are known to exist are the oldest of the existing documents.
Today, many ancient biologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survive and are still alive.
It's a dinosaur. It's a dinosaur.
And that's what we're talking about.
So, we have a pair of legs with a pair of scales and claws, an egg, and we walk on two legs like a tirannosaurus.
We're going to talk about how computers work. We're going to talk about how computers work.
The binary number is represented by one of the two values (0 or 1), and these numbers are called binary or bits for using computer language.
It's not possible to detect internal addiction immediately, because it's a common condition, such as vomiting.
The most obvious sign of internal addiction is that the containers of chemicals and toxic chemicals are open.
Look at the label of the poison and see if there's any first aid instructions for that particular poison.
It's called the insect population.
This name is derived from the ancient name of a pest that lives in a human being with a high adaptive capacity.
The leatherbacks and the bedbugs are the tenets that have adapted to live in host homes and homes.
In the United States, the number of known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) is estimated at about 400,000 and is known as the leading neurotic disease of young and middle-aged people.
It's a disease that affects the central nervous system of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
In the study, women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
We're not going to be able to raise children.
It's like a baby. It's like a baby.
It's not like we're going to have a baby.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works by scientific means.
But that's not all, that's just an experiment, that's a test that's used to eliminate more than one of the possible assumptions, and that's also the key to scientific research.
It's not just a book, it's a book.
So, what was accepted was the Aristeles' view of everything in science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greece waned, we realized that the West had been cut off from Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are ultimately dependent on the existence of endocrine periods and the fact that they are carved through the internal clocks.
It's not just a reaction from outside, but it's recorded for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The clock is a self-inflicted device that has no external signal.
So, this is one of the most powerful experiments that we've seen in the last couple of years.
Hersie and Chase used the virus to implant its DNA into bacteria.
They tried two experiments, one marked with radioactive phosphorus on Farge's DNA, and the other marked with radioactive sulfur on Farge's proteins.
Mutations can have different effects depending on whether a cell is a germ cell or not.
And this is what happens when you have a mutation in a germ cell.
Tourism, with its emphasis on contact with nature, is fascinating to people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants.
There are examples of local activities such as hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, research on the ecosystem.
We're going to see and photograph and learn some examples of the Olanutans in the island of Bonneo.
Every morning, those who leave a small rural town to work are not like those who have a job near their place of departure.
In this dynamic transport, everyone is somehow connected to and supported by a private vehicle.
And that's what we're seeing here.
It's not just the public transportation system, it's the public transportation system, it's the public life.
In the developed world, we rarely hear complaints such as water quality or bridge destruction.
Why does transportation create such complaints and break down on a daily basis, or is there a more fundamental problem?
So, what we're going to do is we're going to look at a study of the flow between individual drivers and vehicles.
It's hard to study the flow of traffic, because we can't predict the driver's behavior 100%.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable and consistent range, and therefore they tend to have a certain degree of consistency and can be expressed mathematically.
So, for example, we have a relationship between three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and speed, so that the flow is more appropriate.
These relationships help us plan, design and run road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky.
It's made up of many different kinds of insects, and most insects are designed to fold the wings along the body.
