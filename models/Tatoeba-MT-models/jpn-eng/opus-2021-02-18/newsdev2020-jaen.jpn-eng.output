Croatia has a nuclear reactor program. Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds gathered in the western town of Bosnia to protest the plans of the neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the area near the beautiful natural river near the Bosnian border.
Protesters gathered in Novido, a town in Bosnia, urged Croatia to fight the plan to store the ruins of the Tulgofska Gola's barracks.
The facility will store the waste from the nuclear power plant in Kruciko.
With banners such as "Do Not Take a Health Future", Bosnians said that nuclear waste disposal facilities could threaten the lives of some 25,000 people living in and around the Una River.
We must resist.
The head of Novi Graud, Milroslav Dorgerka, said to the crowd:
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
"Culsco nuclear power plant, which started in the 980s, is located in Siberia and is owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will hold a conference next week to discuss the building of more waste disposal facilities.
On Friday, Croatia announced that Croatia should build its own storage facility, or that it has not yet decided whether to pay for Croatia's waste to be processed at new facilities.
The minister of environmental energy in Croatia, Tomisslav Chorich, told the announcer that Croatia is having problems with school, hospitals, and waste disposal of public facilities from prison and that he wants to get a full picture of the solution:
In Bosnia, activists, officials, and residents of all ethnic groups in the country insisted that Croatia look for another place to build near nuclear power plants.
"Why is the best place for Bosnian pants in all of Croatia, the Trugovska, or Gora?" he asks.

Who's Münhüssen's syndrome, which appeared in the Politian Netflix?
The symptoms are that parents and parents fake that healthy children are sick.
The Politian will be broadcast on Netflix today.
The drama is about Payton Hobart, the president of the United States, but first of all, it's the first step to become president of his high school.
Produced by the American Hollar Story, by Dr. Ryan Murphy, the producer of Gree, the cast was Gwines Partlow, Ben Prattt, and Lucy Boyd.
I try not to make as much noise for the audience as possible, but in the drama, I can tell you how I feel about the Münchhousen syndrome - a mental illness that the guardian behaves as if it were a physical or mental illness, even though the person under his protection is not really sick.
There are many different types of disease, but there are also Münchhousen syndromes, which are false to themselves.
However, the deputy Münhauser syndrome is a fact that the other person who is clearly protected is a disease.
It's a form of child abuse.
It's unusual, but it's usually the parents who exaggerated the symptoms or caused the symptoms to look like children were sick.
So what are some of the symptoms of the representative Münhinghauser syndrome?
The symptoms of the illness change in the case case, but NHS points out:
Children are healthy, but they try to convince the medical staff that they're not well.
I'm either overexplaining, or I'm complaining of false symptoms.
They invent tests to make it appear that the child is sick, such as mixing glucose with a urine sample and making it look like diabetes.
Overuse of drugs and other drugs can cause the symptoms of the disease to appear on purpose.
How common is the deputy Münhinghauser syndrome?
It's hard to know how widespread the syndrome is, because many cases have not been reported.
In one study published in 2000, it was estimated that 89 out of 100,000 people were born in two years.

Nigeria: Police force in Kaduna schools, 300 children rescued
Kaduna - Caduna Police arrested seven teachers and rescued nearly 300 children yesterday by forcing an investigation of the Imam Mydhung-Tunma school in the Igabi precinct.
They say the children were placed in in inhumane conditions, but the school denies the claim.
“All the children are in school with their parents’ approval, and their claims are not true.”
"Before the child entered, the parents signed the consent form.
The parents came daily to deliver food to their children, and they know what the environment is like.
I was surprised when the police came and evacuated the children and took away all the food they had brought them.
This is unfair when some parents can testify to whether or not they had children in a terrible environment, as the police say."
He adds that Abuduraman, former chief of police, visited his children once to see what kind of environment they were in, but never complained.
They're just studying the Koran, that's all.
However, police chief Yakub Cactus says the children will be reunited with their parents after being handed over to the state government.
"I'm not going to tell you anything," said Mr. Marvel.
Many of the children had scars on their backs.
So I'm working on the school to find out who owns the facility."

Central Coast's "the worst of the worst" women's rapes and court orders against their victims.
In May 2017, a man wearing a leafed, colorful gilly suit grabbed a 12-year-old girl behind her back and dragged her into the bush while she was attending a school in the Central and Central Coast of the state.
After that, the man grabbed the girl in a tree and sexually assaulted her.
A search warrant was issued shortly after the arrest, and police seized dozens of items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, the man was found guilty of seven charges of assault and other charges against another 11-year-old girl, including three counts of sexual abuse.
The 12-year-old victim turned around on the trail and saw a man armed with a large tree branch and knife suddenly emerge from the bush.
The girl said, "Stop, stop, stop," and he locked her up and forced her into the bush.
Men don't shout at girls.
If you scream, you'll have to get hurt."
The man, holding a blade in his right hand, tied a girl's hands to a tree after he tied her to a cable, abused her for almost an hour.
When the man pulled the cable, the girl ran to school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at work around 9:30 a.m., with several text messages and phone calls from his workmate.
The man stood in his clothes, dressed in mud, grass, trees, and so forth, being attacked by street violence, chasing the driver to the bush, and arguing that he had done it with his hands.
The case of a man continues on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development warns public interest representatives and IT companies
Pope Francisco warned IT corporate representatives, diplomats, and investors that without the morale of the public interest, the artificial intelligence competition and other digital development could increase social injustice.
The pope spoke at the Vatican conference held by government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and economists.
The conference, entitled "The Public Interest of the Digital Age," has also invited a few scholars and Catholic bishops.
The last three days of conferences also gave the Vatican the latest proof of its willingness to participate in the debate about the future and dangers of artificial intelligence development.
The conference discussed the future of war technology development and increasing mechanical operations, while also giving examples of shootings in New Zealand, as well as the treatment of social media companies during a brutal video spill.
In his speech at the conference, the pope praised the progress of technology by showing how machines freed workers from danger and simple labor during the dawn of the industrial revolution.
But he warned that too much reliance on robotics for profit could rob humans of the dignity of their work.
"If the progress of technology is a cause of more and more marked inequality, it is not a true step forward."
If the so-called technological progress of man is against the public good, then we will, unfortunately, be in a state of utter brutality, based on the theory of powerful men.
According to the organizers of the conference, they want to take advantage of the expertise of participants and find out who will be future advisers to the Catholic Church in the high-tech field.

Leal Madrid won the Osana in two-zero, is now updated to the top of La Liga's list of defeats in the country's season.
But this season in La Rega, the director of the Gennaine Gidan is under tremendous pressure from such things as the open war in Wales and the public disparities with Wales star Gareth Bay.

Anna Hazale, Maharashtra, the name of Shalado Powerl has come to mind in the case of the fraud of a joint loan.
Anna Hazale said, "When the case was called, there was no name on the list for Sharad Powerl."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised to find the name of Sharad Powerle's head of the National Congress Party (NCP) suddenly appeared in the tens of millions of Rupes-related union bank frauds in Mahalashtra.
In connection with the fraud, the ED has filed a money-cleaning suit against the minister of the state of Mahalashtra, my nephew.
Based on the money-cleaning law, the government's report on the police's first report was registered by the central authorities.
The case is based on the first report by Mumbai police to which the names of former head of the bank, Ajit Powerl, and 70 former union bank members were charged.
When the case was contacted, the name of Sharad Powerl was nowhere to be found.
When questioned by the government about the lawsuits and the alleged involvement of Sharad Powerar in the fraud case, Anna Hazale said on Thursday, "We know how Sharad's name came to light, who himself mentioned it."
Anna Hazale, a critic of Sharad Powerl, expressed her hopes that the authorities will find out if they conduct a detailed investigation into the fraud case.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of a number of anti-corruption activities, said, "The authorities will know how his name came up in the incident."
Sharad Powerl denied all injustice and questioned the timing of the lawsuit just a few weeks before the Maharashtra elections on October 21.

I'm going to eliminate the accident of Axel pedal!
- Four Oato Messe Web - Yahoo! News
I'm sure Reisnavre can buy you some peace of mind.
Car accident caused by a driver's mistake.
One of the reasons for this is that there is an increase in the number of accidents caused by accidents in the brakes and the accelerators of older drivers.
So, we're going to do this in a different way, especially when we're in a panic situation, and sometimes we're going to do this because we're going to be on a brake pedal.
There are new cars equipped with safe driving support to cover all these mistakes, but there are also non-cars that can be installed.
An emergency prevention and prevention system developed and sold by an after-part manufacturer like that.
I'm going to show you what each of these features are.
Axel and brake are narrowed and you're going to walk at the same time.
[E-ACCELL ALARM]
So what we're going to do is we're going to use the alarm sound to ward off the pedal's error.
It's a very simple way of doing this.
So what we're going to do is we're going to have to respond to the sound, we're going to urge the accelerator to return, and we're going to avoid sudden acceleration by quickly recognizing the error.
It's also effective for older drivers who can't see the changes in engine sounds and who can’t hear.
The suit is inserted into the OBDII connector and the body is taped.
It's a little bit more complicated than that, but it's also a little bit more convenient.
The World Wing launched its release in mid September.
We don't just move forward, we go backwards.
Forward and backward from stop (and less than 10km/h) at stop-and-turn, detect the vehicle's speed and brake signals, electrically suppressing the acceleration.
If you accidentally stepped on an accelerator, you would not deliver a signal from the accelerator, but you would immediately be in a cryptic run state (with the brakes off in the D-range) to control the sudden launch.
It also has the ability to detect speeds of about 5km/h and force vehicles to switch to a concrete state.
So we're going to have to install it.
It's a total price of $37,000.

"When you're old enough to sit still, you take care of your surroundings."
A woman in the center of Saga, who has five children from 4 to 2 years of age, has been flooded with water around her house.
“I can’t run away with five people,” he says, with food and a toilet as much as I can at home during the disaster.
"There's no right way to prepare for anything that needs to change in the family structure or in the home."
Kashimoto-san, a 6-year-old and 8-year-old girl, suggested that the school had a absent-school e-mail message the day before, but the school had no network and no email system.
There was a need to build a system that could share the flooded roads in real time.
"The weather was different before, and I wanted to prepare for disaster because it's not "the last time it was okay."
"The opinions are also going to be discussed as an organization."
Mr. Boris Johnson and the female businessman, Jennifer Arcelli, have been contacted by the police director's office.
IOPC (IOPC) will now consider whether President Johnson should be questioned for violating the criminal law in London's mayor's office.
The Great London Administration (GLA) announced that the director of the GLA had recorded "the matter of the conduct of the Prime Minister" regarding the suspicion that he was being treated in favor of friendship with the Prime Minister.
"The 'things of action' exist when there is information that a crime may have been committed," she says.
This has never been proved.
IOPC will now see if we need to investigate this matter.
The issue was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to charges made by the British and Wales police.
The issue was entrusted to the police director's office because Johnson was referring to a position similar to that of the commissioner at the time.
Johnson denies fraud in connection with Arculi's friendship.
Earlier, Johnson claimed he was wrong, but he said he was going to follow the order of the London Parliament for further information on his relationship to Mr. Acumen.
According to a report from the Sunday Times, this statement was received by American Mr. Alkali, who had migrated to London seven years ago, who paid him £126,000 pounds from the London mayor's pension, and three times he and Johnson joined a trade mission across the country.
Since then, the government has frozen a million pounds of subsidy to the company of Alkali, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked a disturbing question about the investigation that took place before the grant was paid.
In the House of Representatives Matt Warman said that the Digital Ministry has "normal and proper ratings" and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the phone on the number had been transferred to the California office where Mr. Arkuri (34) is now based.
The relationship between prime minister and female businessmen was "open secret among the staff."
GLA's efforts to entrust the Prime Minister to the police authorities have provoked the wrath of the Prime Minister's residence.
High government officials say that this is a political-minded attack and that the timing of the night before the conservative party was a "too short party".
"In no case, the director's office had not submitted any evidence, and the Prime Minister was not given the opportunity to speak to the director before the announcement was made late Friday night."
The public and the press will see the political madness that has been set up.
The Standard newspaper said earlier that friendship between Johnson and California businessmen, supported by the London Ministry of Tourism and Community Development, was a "public secret" among the staff.
The London and Partners (L.P.) said that even though someone at the time thought that Arkuri was “untrustworthy” in his company, he had the privilege of accompanying him to a trade-related meeting outside the country, led by Johnson, the mayor:
A fund of security that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
This is the 20th anniversary of the Loveful Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard about the prospect in the photo of the president of Japan.
It's been a long time since we've had the opportunity to do this.
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
And that's what I'm going to show you.
I'd like to thank you very much for not only the history of the internet, but all the people involved.
It's the idea of "to support the formation of the property of ordinary people."
I've been following this spirit for 20 years.
I am working my day-to-day job as a whole, hoping that the world will be bright from the ground when people in general are relieved of their anxiety about money.
In the long run, you'll never get a job unless you're with the recipients.
It's called "The Fudge of the World."
I feel that you understand the message that we've been saying all day: "This is the time to support the companies that are needed in the world."
We believe it's because it's been a 20-year long fund and it's been a direct-selling system that can reach many people directly.
We've been doing this for a long time.
We're going to talk about what's going on in this video, and generally, we're just going to tell you the results, and the information we're buying now is in the black box.
And that's why we're here.
Mc Miller's death, key to the third drug arrest.
Los Angeles (AP) - a drug crime related to the death of rapper Mac Miller last year from an overdose of drugs, a third man was charged with arrest.
According to the court records, Stephen Walter was charged with selling the fake Occupium tablets in which Fentanill was laced with cocaine, alcohol, and phthalates before his death last September, but Fentanil is a powerful opioid drug that is so widespread that thousands of people in the United States are dying.
Walter is charged with supplying drugs to another person who sold drugs to Mr. Miller.
According to the court records released on Tuesday, Petitt had been getting drugs from Walter all through August.
Ryan Levis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Petit as Walter's "manager".
None of them are directly charged with Miller's death, and there are still arguments on individual cases.
Walter, who is currently in custody, was on probation for the drug incident in 2005, and he has already been sentenced to five months in prison for his violation of the law.
The prosecutors responsible for the first reported case reported by the celebrity site TMZ Thursday require that Walter be detained until the trial begins because it is highly likely that he will flee the country.
I didn't get a quick answer to the answering call to my lawyer.
Pettyt was filed by the Federal Court on September 4, but his lawyer refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics have been so frank about depression and drug use that they have won fans in the hip hop world as one of the main attractions.
Millers from Pittsburgh, his real name is Malcolm James Myers McCormick, who had been dating singer Ariana Grande for two years, but ended in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of her beloved mirror on her Instagram and wrote a song about the mirror, "Thank you Next".
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in connection with recent Opioid drug abuse.
Gitalist Matthew Roberts of 3 Dors Down also died of an overdose of drugs in 2016, and Fentanill and hydrocodone have been found in his body.
In this post, he corrected Walter's name with Stephen instead.
Nigeria's 9-year-olds, developed over 30 mobile games
This 9-year-old is working on a game of hide-and-seek using a free programming app called punish 2.
We can create games, cartoons, stories, and so on, on and off-line.
So far, Basil has been using this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game that bats are programmed to hide.
We're going to do this in the next video, and we're going to do this in the next video.
I've learned how to make games in short-term intensive courses.
Basil told CNN, "I spend my time playing games when I'm bored."
In March, his father applied to a five-day intensive course for children between the ages of 5 and 15.
This course by CodeFest International was introduced to give children like Basil access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Occupa-Sinia, he grew up playing a lot of mobile games.
Basil used to take his cell phone and play games, so he bought a tablet when he was four.
The candy crash and Temple Runn did a lot of work.
But since I was constantly criticized for playing games, I became interested in Basil's game production at seven years of age.
"One day, as usual, I was playing tablet, but I became so obsessed with the game that I got a little upset," he said.
I was frustrated, and I said, "I'm always playing games, why don't you make your own games so that others can play?"
I was angry when I said it, and I didn't think Basil would mind."
Since then, she has been eager to learn how to make her own games, and she has asked her parents to buy her laptop so that she can sign up for the first step in learning how to play them.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his game the exact name:
One of the games, Mosquito Mash, can be bought at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, with younger people like Basil taking the lead when it comes to innovation in Africa.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians were honored to create a robot to clean up their homes using program code.
In May, in the 2019 robotics competition, Ghana's girl high school team, who programmed robots, the Aquabots won.
The African investment in Google and Microsoft giant technology has increased to become a future programming star for Basil and her peers.
Former President North Carolina, convicted of fraud in a corruption investigation.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is expected that former president of the Democratic Republic of North Carolina will testify against a federal agent who has conducted a corruption investigation involving major political donors.
In a federal court case list, Robin Hayes is to plead guilty next Wednesday.
Based on the fact that Hayes' lawyer signed a document prepared as part of a plea deal, he was aware that he was making false statements against the FBI's agents in a 2018 corruption investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which charges Hayes recognizes.
Hayes was originally charged with conspiracy, corruption, and false statements.
The prosecution has accused former MP Hayes of involvement in a plan for an insurance company that was willing to contribute to the state's director's election in return for special treatment.
Greg Lindbergh's executive and two co-workers are being accused of trying to bribe the director of the state's insurance company, Mike Corsey.
Lindbergh is the founder of insurance and investment companies, donated more than $5 million since 2016 to state and federal candidates and committees, and has been the state's top political contributor for recent years.
Lindbergh supported Republican ideals and politicians, but he also donated to the Democrats.
I asked Lindberg's lawyer to comment on Friday, but he didn't answer.
On Friday, he asked for additional comments from the defense attorney, Mr. Barnes, for an email but didn't respond.
A court document submitted on Friday said that in August of 2018, Hayes had lied to the FBI agent, saying that he never had a conversation with the state insurance staff.
But according to fact-based documents, Hayes was actually talking about the transfer of personnel from state insurance managers and Lindbergh's insurance office.
The prosecution also helped Lindbergh with his offer to meet with Corsie, and spoke directly with the director about bribes.
The charges released in April claimed that Lindbergh was going to spend up to $2 million on the election campaign to re-election Coosey in 2020, demanding special treatment for his insurance services.
According to the charges, the conspiracy involved an order by the authorities who were investigating Lindbergh's company.
Republican Kosy reported an attempted bribe to a federal agent and helped with the case.
I'm not being accused of anything.
In a conversation, including Lindbergh and Koosey, the prosecution notes that Lindbergh's co-worker instructed Hayes to transfer a quarter of a million dollars to Koo-Correo's re-election campaign.
According to the charges, Hayes initially argued that the money that was so expensive would attract attention, but ended up breaking it in the conversation.
The charges say Hayes will do whatever you want.
All right, I'll do it.
I've been asked by the D.E.A.'s pressman for more information on the plea deal in e-mails, but he didn't answer.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
It's the first attempt in the world to create a sense of well-being for the users, and some users will soon find that they like it for other people's posts!
The same changes that followed the start of an Instagram test in July will make it personal.
The new Facebook attempt has been launched on Friday, and it is due to begin in Australia soon.
The change was based on mental health experts who believe that happiness surveys and similar numbers are responsible for social comparison.
Garrick considered "a very positive feedback from many associated bullying groups and mental health groups."
It's not about the number of likes and reactions, it's just about removing numbers so that you can focus on the quality of interaction and the quality of content.
Garrick said that it is hoped that users will be more safe to share on the platform than to feel the competition.
Garrick also assured the businesspeople who are looking for Facebook that they will receive the same tricks and content they have access to:
It's too early to say that they will run the same tests in countries such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland and other countries where Instagram has run tests.
Instagram, a Facebook umbrella, has not announced when the test will end and when it will be changed.
"There were initial positive feedbacks about the Instagram experience, but now it's a process of listening and learning," Garrick said.
Garrick, from Australia, a world interned country, pointed out that Australia is a user of Facebook and Instagram, which are very active in technology:
He thought that Australia was a wonderful country with good feedback about whether this was a good experience for people or not.

And then one day, I got my mom's favorite bag.
If my bag's broken, I'd like to fix it and continue to love it.
So I'm going to show you how to do this.
"I don't know if I'm selling anymore."
My mother's broken bag, and her elbow is the ultimate puchipra.
So we're going to do a lot of work.
My mother said, "I don't want to give up," but I didn't want to give up.
So let's go through the home center and see if we can find something that can be replaced by this combination.
And that's what we're talking about.
So that's what I'm going to do.
I went to Candu, but I finally found it!
I was touched when I found it in the hand corner.
Let's do another one.
It's like the parts that are used for key holders and CharmDY.
So we're going to use one at each end of the bag handle.
The ring is small, but if you line it with a bagful left on the other side, it's exactly the same....
This is the way to fix the bag.
We're on it.
I'm so excited.
The opening of the ring is designed to break inward, and it's strong to pull outward.
So let's see if we can do that.
It's a good color for the gold, but the ring size is too small, so it's too tight.
So let's do that.
We've got more tools, but because of the light parts, we've got no problem with weight.
I'm not going to do that.

Pakistan's social media star, Kandir Baloch's brother is in prison for a life sentence for an honorable murder.
A popular photo posted on social media by Kandir Baloch was strangled in July 2016.
Kandir Baloch's brother, a popular Pakistani social media user, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday and was sentenced to life imprisonment for the most prominent "honor killing" in Pakistan's chief state.
Barrow, who was famous for being provocative in Pakistan, a highly feminine woman, was strangled to death in July 2016.
My brother, Muhammad Wasim, was arrested.
In a press conference a few days later, he said, "Of course, I couldn't forgive my sister for killing her, and I didn't regret what I did.
His lawyer, Saldar Mamud, told AFP that a court in the eastern city of Multan, who had convicted the defendant of his life by waiting for a sentence, was sentenced to life imprisonment.
"Insharrah will be acquitted in the Supreme Court," he said.
Earlier, Barotti's mother, Anwar May, told AFP that she wanted her son to be acquitted.
"My son is innocent.
My daughter and my son."
The murder of Baloch has made headlines around the world, calling for action against the spread of so-called "honor killing" by victims, mostly women, for disregarding the rules of the authoritarian society.
Women have been burned, shot, stabbed or strangled in the case of Valoroch in honor of her sexuality and shamed by her family.
Murders are usually performed by relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kirsars and the Diya law allow the perpetrators to ask forgiveness from the victim's relatives.
Three months after Baloch's murder, the parliament passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honor killings.
But whether murder is a crime of honor is up to the judgment of the judge, the murderer can argue theoretically for other reasons, and may even be pardoned.
In Mr. Baloch's case, his parents at first insisted that he not be pardoned.
But the sad parents, who thought they would lose their son, changed their minds and asked him to forgive them.
In the face of international hatred for the killing, the Pakistani government has taken unprecedented steps to declare that the country is also a successor with its parents, but the case has continued.
Baroch's famous move includes his offering to show the Pakistani cricket team a strip show, and his wearing a wide red dress on Valentine's Day.
Despite criticism and threats, many people, including young people, have recognized that describing themselves as being like Kim Kardashian has opened the heavens and the earth in a country that is considered to be a political activity that is bold and that improves women's status.
The roots of "honor" killing are ethnic norms that remain widely preserved throughout South Asia, particularly for women's behavior, but sometimes men become victims.

A cold seat box set up in the old Kakuoka area of the Motocho Area.
The Yamaguchi newspaper gives to four municipalities in the Fukushima area of Japan, which was devastated by the earthquake off the coast of Tokyo in June, and to the 8600 aluminum shelters and 5 outdoor storage boxes (approximately $100 U.S.).
I'm going to need you to set up a "first-rate shelter" in various coastal areas in preparation for the tsunami.
The ceremony will be held next month at the First Evacuation in the Latques region.
After the earthquake in Okaka, Japan, which has signed a joint agreement, we give the local government of the area the nearest earthquake site a cold seat.
The donor is Motoya Ishikawa (400 units, 2 storage boxes).
Many residents of the coast of Japan fled for fear of the tsunami when the earthquake struck off the coast of Manchuria.
He fled to the main shelters in Tokyo City, as well as on the high ground of the communities.
There was no massive tsunami, and most evacuees returned home instead of moving to a second location where shelters and shelters were available.
In preparation for similar disasters, measures of extreme cold and wind have been one of the challenges.
A sheet where you can cover your entire body when you evacuate and cover the cold and the wind.
They're also equipped with a heat shield under the sun.
So this is going to be a little bit more complicated.
Using four layers of metal, silver, and tail to cover the body, they perform a heat shield under cold weather and heat.
A metal box to store the sheets is installed in the main shelters outside.

"The Opening of Arts"
A painting of "The Arts Show" lined up in front of a store in Akasaka.
The third exhibition of art for disabled people in Okamayama was launched on the 27th day in a street corner of the town of Okayama, Japan.
A collection of free ideas and expressions that are not part of the formal concept has attracted shoppers.
On the 4th of the 4th day, Okamayama's auditorium will be held in the Japanese Field Building.
"Five paintings, building, seven," and "five photos" from all over the province.
The paintings are in front of each store, the building is full of underground art spaces, and the photos are lined up with Asano cameras.
Some of the pieces are printed on banners, and are shown over the top of the shop district, hanging over the top of the arcade.
The paintings are bold and colorful, they are represented in delicate strokes and impressive works.
The unique design of such objects as Danball, clay, umbrellas, and other objects is unique, as well as a photograph of the four seasons of the sun and the Himalayas.
The chairman of the Activist Committee of the Association for the Intellectual and Intellectual Welfare of the City says: "The way the work blends into the city, it touches nature and art, and I want many citizens to enjoy it."
The exhibition was launched in '20 after a high chance that the works of those who did not have a professional education in art would be "art of art" .
This time, we're going to host the 27th anniversary of the "20" Okamayama Art Intervention, which is the same time period as the "The International Festival of Arts in Inland Japan" program for the beginning of the 28th to the fall of the season.
On the 29th, there will be workshops where you can experience small objects such as earrings, with the edge of tin cans, on a live paint tour with a guide and a general participation.
(From left) The ASA's School of Sports
The National Academy of Sciences and the Association of Sports Associations in Nagao, Nagashima, and the ELOVE of Nagashima, formed a partnership to support the development of free island sports on 25 days.
In addition to actively working with two organizations, such as training training and training in various sports, they also provide mutual support for children on the island, such as when children from the remote island travel outside the island.
When the two groups conduct sports courses, they send personal trainers and lecturers and share information.
When a team from the remote island journeys outside the island, they also tackle challenges such as the burden of travel and the difficulty of trainers.
In particular, we will be working with the “School Center for Sports in Sapporo, Japan”, which is associated with ASA during the district convention and other local conventions, to help prevent the decline in performance of athletes due to fatigue due to sea travel and sleeping.
And during the convention at Miyai and Okinawan island, they also work with local and hospital personnel to support players from outside the island.
On the 25th, there was a conciliatory ceremony in Elabco, I'm familiar with.
After that, both groups organized an Asretique Trainer's Day class called Toping.
Local sports youth groups, team leaders, and parents learned how to use them properly and how to prevent them.
The director of Nagata, 52, said that the campaign to eliminate the Handi of the remote island in the sports environment is common and there is much we can do to cooperate with each other.
"It's very reassuring to have a partnership with organizations like ASA, if you want to absorb something in order to maintain the sports environment of children on the island."
This is the age when traditional traditions are broken.
You know, I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I've been in love with a guy who's able to refresh himself.
As a brain scientist, I've been thinking a lot about love.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about the way we're going to deal with this.
I'll send you a copy.
In the previous article, the unrecognizable otoko stuck to the traditional style of fantasy and fantasized that there was an overwhelming lack of pattern learning to love!
We've talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool guy.
It's hard to live when you're caught up in what you should do.
In the introduction, we talked about the need to look at the works and the behaviors of people and learn patterns every day.
So, what we're going to do is we're going to learn patterns.
I don't know if I'm going to be popular or not, but I think I'm still evolving every day.
That's why it's hard to live.
I've been teaching at Tokyo and Tokyo University, so I've talked a lot with young people, and I've learned a lot about how to interact with them.
But if you're in a position there to be a university professor, and you're stuck with the old pattern,
I don't care about that. I enjoy it every day.
It's hard to live like this.
Because if you don't change, people will change.
That's what I've been talking about in my recent meeting book, even in the worst of the world.
It's not just about the people. It's about the people.

It's painful to ask around.
He was playing around at the Cannes Film Festival.
He's a light guy, but he's going to be treated as a great filmmaker.
So, if you're a successful person, you don't have to act like a big guy.
I mean, you can't make it light when you're being taken in by your character.

Doubles the number of refugees in the illegal northwest of Nigeria: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
In the past four months, according to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from western Nigeria has doubled to about 40,000 due to increased violence.
According to the UN Refugee Organization, the chaos has created a “new humanitarian crisis” that will require a new $3.5 million fundraising effort by the end of the year.
Bokoharam, a Muslim extremist organization that has been anti-government in northern Nigeria for 10 years, said it had nothing to do with the recent armed attacks.
Rather, violence in Sokot, Zamfara, and Katsina in the past ten months has been caused by organized armed groups.
“It’s a full picture of the horrors of illegal conditions and unstable conditions,” Barok said to the press on Friday.
The reporter said that kidnappings, tortures, kidnappings, murders and sexual violence are common and that attackers are also working to destroy homes and steal them.
The military and police are also being sent to fight against criminal organizations in the area.
However, the military is tired of fighting Boko Haram and the Islamic West African branch that was torn from the old group in 2016.
"The refugees don't come by the name of a group," he says.
What they bring is a terrible story.
Most of the refugees have gone to neighboring Niger.
In a statement, UNHCR announced that the security situation in Socoto, especially in Socoto, would increase in the next few months.
The new trial date for a man who murdered two women and children.
The trial date for the Guatemalan man who was said to have murdered a woman and two children in Iowa has been established.
According to the Pok County Court's record, Marvin Escobar Orellana, 31, was charged with first-class murder in three cases, which the authorities first identified as Marvin Esquivel Lopez, who was known as the police.
He claims he's innocent.
Police say he shot her daughter (11), and her son (5).
According to the court's record, a new date for the trial will give both the plaintiff's attorneys more time to prepare.
According to U.S. immigration customs officials, Escobar Orellana was deported twice before the shooting because of her illegal stay in the United States.
He was convicted of illegal entry to the United States in 2010.
Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) has launched a header-bordered advertisement with "Previd.js" (LFP) offering:
LFP is a service to buy and prun its own advertising frameworks, which meet the wishes of the advertisers.
The main service provides an effective advertising framework through the DSP's Logicad.
The idea is that by a fair bid competition in several vendors, the media will be able to channel a single-priored advertisement to media run by media companies.
The media is transparent to mediums, and has been introduced to mainstream media as a solution that is expected to improve revenues.
So far, "Loggicad" has provided USP through the advertising framework.
In recent years, LFP has been launched in December to direct the purchase of an ad frame in accordance with the wishes of the advertisers by media in order to respond to the requests of individuals, brand-images, and specific ads that are more esoteric to each other.
This time, response to the header building will expand LFP's introductions.
As a benefit for advertisers, LFP's header-building response makes it possible to participate directly in the bids to the header-to-stage category, and hopes to improve the delivery of advertising opportunities.
The limited access to the media also provides a channel frame for distribution according to individual commercials and brands, to prevent loss of brand value.
The benefits for mediums are that the solution that manages the code of the Bidders called "Wrapper" can be used to meet the needs of the medium companies.
A small company's product, Jétro's aid, sold at the Ates of a foreign news site.
The Japanese Trade Development Organization (Jetro) has launched a project to support the spread of small businesses via Internet marketing sites abroad.
An attempt to set up a special Japanese section on an overseas site to introduce products from different parts of the world and to sell them directly to foreign consumers.
Over a thousand companies are making progress in China and Southeast Asia.
"JAPAN MALL" was launched last year.

In view of the attacks on students and other acts of oppression against the students, Yamaguchi Tokyo announced that on 27th, Japan's 30-year-old male deacons who worked at the U.S.A. campus were suspended for two months in jail.
Exploitation on the same date.
According to the Ministry of State, from about October 2017, the gynecology of the men was subjected to intense emotional stress over and over again to verbal abuse, as it instructed several students in the lab.
It's a pawahar in education, and it's proven to have made the academic environment worse.
Several students filed the survey in September 1818.

The newspaper The Sun called on Mr. Boris Johnson to reduce the demand for a break-off from the EU and to make compromises with the EU.
Now, only three weeks before the final European summit, there is growing concern that the Prime Minister is running out of time to make a big contribution.
Boris Johnson is facing a domestic revolt to lower his demand to leave the EU and negotiate compromises with the EU.
The negotiations over the new customs system, instead of the back stop clauses related to Ireland's borders, have been stagnant, while the EU considers Johnson’s alternative to "unexactable".
The higher ministers hope that the European leaders, led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel, will suggest compromises such as setting up a time limit for the back stop for three years.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who are ready to confront the Prime Minister next week after the conservative annual convention in Manchester.
They're going to call for the Prime Minister to abandon his "absolute" strategy to threaten the EU, which he designed by senior adviser Dominic Cummings, without consent, and to accept an offer that the EU will offer in a limited amount of time.
A cabinet minister said that the ruling that the Supreme Court ruled against the closing of parliament on Tuesday is a “warning” and that the compromise is the only way we can break off on the day of September 3.
We will never win the numbers in the House, they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use whatever is available.
It doesn't work, it doesn't work, and Cummings' plan is clearly failing.
We can't fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet minister promised Mr. Johnson that if he didn't, he'd tell her to carry out the agreement with former Prime Minister Terisa May.
He added, "If you need me, I'm going to tell Boris to put Teriza's agreement back in the House."
So let's see.
If we delay, Boris will end, and we will all end.
John Major accused Boris of not taking negotiations seriously.
The former leader of the conservative party, in a bitter speech, told us that the Prime Minister wants to make an agreement with the EU.
However, we do not see the Prime Minister come into a discussion with the EU and make a agreement.
Instead, we have seen Prime Ministers fighting bulls in Scotland, testing eggs on waitresses, and arguing with the public on the streets.
The Prime Minister's pressman recognized yesterday that the agreement was far ahead and said, "If no one should be mistaken, it's a long way to go."
However, the press also said that Ben's bill, which imposes a three-month postponement when leaving without consent, “is a major reduction in our negotiations in Brussels.”
The press said, "I'm sure this bill prevents our negotiations, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to keep moving forward despite the fact that it has passed."
The minister of the European Union, Stephen Berkeley, is returning to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
They discuss the document on how the entire island of Ireland works on food and livestock.

Lorraine Kelly revealed that the TV's boss told her that she would never succeed as a host in her crystal-go accent.
The first time I appeared on TV, I said, "I'm so nervous," and 59-year-old Kelly reflected on 35 years in the broadcast industry.
She says, "I was 25 years old, and I was really nervous."
I work as an investigator at the BBC Scotland Bureau, and my boss told me I would never succeed in the TV industry in your glass-go accent.
I went to London to meet everyone on TV-am's team before taking over to Glasgow's office and to see where the show was being broadcast.
That morning, I will never forget that Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing the legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe you were in the same room as a living legend.
I knew where I wanted to be.
Kelly started working as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kirsbide, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-amScottland station in 984.
Kelly also hosted the show on GMTV and ITV’s Blakes and Daybreaks, and then started the show, Lorraine, with her name on it.
For the 35th anniversary of Kelly's most memorable episode and review of the interview.
“Patience and enthusiasm” and “interest” were the key to survival in the TV industry, and his host added, “We have to get it into work.”
I must be honest and honest.
We're going to do what we have to do. We're going to do what we have to do.
Looking back on the news that was shocked, Kelly revealed that the interview on the Dunblane shooting incident was very painful.
"The day after the terrible murder of six students and teachers, I didn't think that many of the families of wounded children were watching us live broadcasts from Dunblane.
We talked for hours at her house, since Pam, who was five-year-old, said she wanted to see me personally.
I went to Jonah's funeral, and Pam and I have been friends ever since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple when Kate and Gary McCann's daughter went missing in 2007, saying that it was “very painful” and said, “I really respect their strength and courage.”
The husband and wife must endure the bitter reality of what's going on in their beloved daughter.
I'm really sorry for the couple.
Lorraine's 35th show will be broadcast on ITV at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe. Chiwenga, afraid of the trap.
According to government officials, Vice President Konstantino Chiwenga has refused to accept the offer of the late president of the late President Robert Mugabe in the midst of political upheavals because of fear that it may be a trap to support military action in November 2017.
In continuing negotiations between Mugabe and the National Guard during the coup, Mugabe offered Chiwenga the office of president, reports the Zimbabwen Independent newspaper last week.
However, Chiwenga refused her offer, not because of anxiety, but because he saw Mugabe's intention to use it to inform world leaders and the African Union that she had been removed from power by a coup.
On a series of Twitters confirming that the authorities are high officials in the presidential government, Jamwanda2 says Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years, is positive about giving power to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munagawa, and was reported to have been making bitter negotiations on the issue at the time.
Government officials say Mugabe has been losing her power and has made contact with Chiwenga by envoys.
According to government officials, the military order and the late and former president of the United States were passed by three men.
The president's spokesman, George Charanva, was involved in negotiations with Aaron Nepera, then head of the Central Intelligence Organization, and the Roman Catholic bishop, Fidelis Mkonoli, who reported:
Gideon Gono, former president of Zimbabwe's Reserve Bank, was commissioned by Mugabe to give the President's seat to Commander Chiwenga (ZDF).
Mgabe, a symbol of Africa after her death, has failed to try to blame the African Union for military action in an effort to seek intervention by African leaders.
The proposal to surrender office to the former CDCF (Civiltain Chiwenga) was not a decision made by the former president of Mugabe.
"It was an act of abandoning to save a situation that had grown dangerously fast", he writes.
There was also some political aim of the late president that he wanted to change the flow, at least diplomaticly.
Remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the Constitution and would not break it.
The late President of Mugabe expected Chiwenga, then the top military leader of the time, to fall into a trap and break their claim that he did not break the constitution.
The late president (Mgabe) hoped that the African Union, which would decide whether to place the whole situation as a coup without a full grasp of it, would eventually be called a coup, and military intervention demands would be considered valid.
That's the underlying intent and calculation of this offer.
Mugabe moved when he realized that he could not be protected by the defense forces, the authorities say.
The military warned him that he would be executed like Gaddafi.
The military commanders told Mugabe that they would not point a gun at the citizens if they were to break into a President's house called Blueloof.
At that point, Mugabe wants to protect his family and prove that he is losing power by the military.
The commanders and the commanders of those days read exactly what they meant.
The message of the president's desperate message was used by government officials with a powerful metaphor: “We belong to a camouflage group, or army, and we are not politicians, we are not just in political competition,” they said.
The military, according to government officials, told the local military commanders that the goal is not to defeat Mgabe but to remove the "cities" surrounding him.
Mugabe also tried to bring Munangwa, who was in a short exile in South Africa in order to talk about coups and successions, back in the same way.
In addition to negotiating with the army, Mugabe needed support from the community.
Not only because of economic power and local power, but because the then president Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the South African Development Community, South Africans, the key to the process, made it clear that if the military forces entered the President’s house again and again, as they refused to intervene, they would be sent to Harare.
"But it was not supported by Putin or African leaders, so it didn't work out," the intelligence sources reported to the Independent newspaper.
The United Nations's second ban on nuclear bombings in support of the treaty was signed by 32 countries.
On the 26th day, a meeting was held at the United Nations headquarters in New York for a nuclear-free world.
This day, five new countries have ratified the ban on the nuclear treaty, and the ratification has become a total of 32 countries and territories.
In order for the treaty to work, it is necessary to ratify 50 countries and regions.
The meeting and ratification took place on the 26th of the United Nations's International Day for the total destruction of nuclear weapons.
The President of the United States spoke out and expressed strong concern about the recent efforts to reverse nuclear disarmament and dispersal.
"It's the only way to get rid of it."
China needs strong leadership, or collapse, policy documents.
China needs the Communist Party to have strong, united leadership, and before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the Chinese government said in a policy document published on Friday:
China’s State Department's news agency stated in its release that since the Communist regime took power 70 years ago, the success has been due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast and the country's situation is complex, but there are few problems to govern.
Without a strong united leadership, China will go into fragmentation and collapse and will be a catastrophe for the world.”
For a long time, Chinese authorities have justified dealing with the problem in a strong way, as in the anti-democracy campaign in Beijing in '989.
On Tuesday, Shinichi Jinping, the top executive of the World's second largest economic nation's memorial service, has been in power since the latter part of 2012, further strengthening party control and exercising strict control of those who oppose the party.
He has also been overseeing the military's modernization program threatening the region.
China is not going to export its development model, she is not going to adopt the model of another country, she is only seeking peace rather than supremacy, says policy documents.
There is no invasion or domination of the world among the Chinese people.
In modern times, China has been harassed by powerful forces, and war and chaos have left a deep mark of its suffering, and China will never let others suffer its own pain.
China is facing a year of anniversary when the country is in a severe trade war with the US and the country is in a state of instability, as well as difficult problems such as recession and opposition in China's Hong Kong region.
China will never abandon its core interests, and will not allow security and sovereignty to be ruined, says the paper.
"The threat of the trade war and the ever - ever - ever-growing tariffs do not solve any problems," says the paper in connection with the trade conflict with Washington.
China is a completed industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a mature economic country with wide market space and powerful economic development.
"Never weaken in a trade war," the paper added.
I am convinced that China has the power to face difficulties and turn crisis into a chance and open up a new world.
China has no ideas against the United States and does not want to take the place of the United States, the US added that China should take China’s development seriously.
The United States can't control China, and it's even less likely to stop China from developing.
America will not maintain its strength if it suppresses, suppresses others, and moves the conflict abroad.
I've got a lot of rumors about what's happening here.
High school baseball is the highest national champion in the country in the spring, and it announced that on 28th, it dismissed Director Tokita and Director Kanko-kun (42) on the same date.
From now on, I'm going to take charge of Takayama's coach, and the director is going to make a quick decision.
Director Manda, we reported that on the 26th of the day, local newspapers were making accusations against baseball staff.
When the school heard from the two of them, he admitted that he grabbed the student's neck and admitted part of the abuse.
In addition, due to a survey of 66 students, I checked the facts again, and I dismissed them on the 28th for admitting it was a fact.

MelC of the spice girls, who fought an eating disorder and banned dieting in the home.
Melanie Chizom of the spice girls admitted that dieting in the home is forbidden at home after years of experience with her own eating disorder, which includes eating nothing but fruits and vegetables.
Despite the pressure of a member of the global pop group and for many years, he continued to “exercise an excess of exercise” and was later diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom explained that his experience also affected his daughter Scarlett's upbringing and that “all diet topics in the home are forbidden.”
"Scarlett is now 10 years old, and she's starting to take care of her appearance," Mel says.
But my experience with eating disorders made me very careful when talking to my daughter.
A positive word. Now it's a habit.
In the 1990s, when I was famous as a member of the spice girls, "the worst" comments on me in the media were still in front of social media, Mel said in an interview with the magazine Women's Health:
"I couldn't take care of myself, I took out certain foods, and I became obsessed with exercise, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and it lasted about a few years.
The same marriage court decision, which will expand diversity: the North Sea newspaper, the electronic version of the U.S.
In a case where "virtually marriage" is a matter of legal action between the same sex, the decision has been made to recognize this.
More than 20 countries recognize same-sex marriage, while in the country there is no legal advantage, but there is a system in which the government can authenticate the same sex partnerships, such as Sapporo City.
The ruling has confirmed the fact of the marriage between two women.
It's the first and most meaningful judicial decision that has been granted legal protection to couples of the same sex.
A lawsuit has been made in five local courts, including Sapporo, that requires the state to pay damages for the violation of same-sex marriage on the grounds of civil law and canon law.
I want to break the sentence, get a better understanding of the rights of the minority, and discuss the existence of a legal system that recognizes a wide variety of family members.
The women stayed together for about seven years, got their marriage certificate in the United States.
The ruling has confirmed "the fact that marriage is no different from marriage between men and women".
It's a fundamental decision to establish a legal marriage that has the right to marriage with social insurance and so on, even between gays.
More importantly, the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution on Freedom of Marriage as "only based on the consent of the two sexes."
"The two genders were not supposed to be same-sex marriage at the time of its inception, so it's not even understood to deny same-sex marriage."
"The Constitution does not believe in same-sex marriage" but does not state whether it is forbidden or not.
On the other hand, the issue has been to reduce the amount of compensation that has been paid for the lack of recognition of same-sex marriage, assuming that the benefits of legal protection are different from those of men and women.
Is it not reasonable to recognize the same as men and women and yet differ from the rights to be protected?
In a national family survey involving married women, the public's consciousness has also changed, including 70 percent of those who feel that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyles become more diverse, if the law is tied to traditional family statues, it will take away the rights of those who do not share it.
In fact, since marriage is not a legal spouse, there are still few limits to the tax system and the lack of joint custody.
In the same-sex marriage debate, we need to review the family law from various perspectives, not only in the same-sex marriage but also in the increasing legal right of marriage.
I'm going to the trial of the trial of Astrid, who was charged with rape of multiple women.
A jury's hearing is being held at the trial of a former University of Delaware baseball player accused of sexually assaulting several women.
"Friday, after a zero-day witness and argument, the jury began to discuss the fate of Clay Conaway (23).
The 2nd-year-old woman says she was sexually assaulted after driving Konaway home.
It was three weeks after they met at a meeting site in Bumble, Konaway sent a photo of herself to a woman.
Konaway has been accused of sexual assault on six women during the 20's 3'3' to 20'8 years, and she is one of them.
The prosecution claimed that women resisted when consented hugs escalated and Connaway tried to assault women.
The defense has taken into account the conflicting claims and memory differences of women and suggests that women may have regretted having physical relations.

New sport on September 27th.
And that's what we're talking about.
Among Sydney’s tourism resources, which bring 2.1 billion dollars to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbor is the largest earner of opera houses, surf keys, Luna Park and the famous Harbour Bridge.
But there's an ugly truth under the bridge.
Sydney’s famous port is one of Australia’s worst waterways, with about 15 Olympic pools per year.
And that's what we're talking about.
According to a new video, from Sydney Harbor down to Sydney, the waterways around Australia’s most popular cities are filled with leaks, plastic bags and bottles, shoes, clothing, and even dead animals — all in Sydney, thanks to rain flowing through the streets.
Among other things, plastic is the biggest factor in blocking waterways.
In a video that happened to be released on September 27th, World Tourism Day, Dr. Catherine Daphne, vice president of the Sydney Harbor Research Program, said, "This is a paradox."
It's beautiful, but it's one of the most altered and polluted estuaries of our coastline.
According to CSIRO, it is estimated that 1560 kilos of plastic per hour will flow into the water, most of which are pouring into Sydney Harbor via the rain drains.
"There's been some terrible rain, but then Sydney Harbor was... quite tragic," Dr. Daphne.
Two-thirds of the pollution is pouring out of the water flowing through the streets.
But it's like the tip of an iceberg, and under the surface of Sydney Harbor, 70 percent of the plastic that goes into the ocean is deposited at the bottom of the ocean.
“I don’t know what the truth is, but it’s hard to know what it is,” said David Manley, owner Richard Nichols, who says that he and his team collect about 500 kilos of plastic garbage each year.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
It's overwhelming, but... more than half of what we discover is a plastic bag.
So we're going to use the remaining half of plastic in at least one place.
Sydney Harbor is beautiful, and I can't believe all this plastic and garbage is flowing under the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and director of Ocean Products, said that he could reduce the flow of plastics and garbage into the water and make it easier for locals and tourists to do so.
"You should start with the source."
We need to be more aware of what's going on in the drains, because we need to reduce the use of plastic, better recycling, and eventually we have to be more aware of what's going on in the drain.
It's about 50 percent of the oxygen that we breathe from the ocean.
It's the ocean that absorbs 30 percent of its CO2 and it's the source of food.
But we're going to fix Sydney Harbor and put it back into its old form.
Killing the sea means killing people.
This month, a new study on plastic and mental health has been published, along with the release of the video by the recycling company TOMRA as part of a widespread campaign to help Australians to understand the environmental and possible impacts of drinking containers in their natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 are desperate for plastic garbage, 25 percent of whom believe that the throwaway plastic garbage problem is the fault of adults.
The study also listed plastic garbage as number four of concerns for parents, and 93 percent of the 551 parents surveyed said they felt useful and worried about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the sea.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic garbage, but they didn't know what to do to change it, which led to ecological unrest.
In October of the Fukushima plant, the chimneys have been demolished.
"the chimney of the old Japanese plant, Nitsuko Nitsuko, began to be demolished in September.
Kyushu announced on 26th that the chimneys of the old Japanese plant in Nitakaki, Japan, will begin in January.
202's expected to be finished by the end of March.
We're going to take apart two of the ones that were used to release the gas at the time of the power.
The book was removed in '99.
The chimneys will be broken down by one by one by one by one by one by one by one by one by one by one by one by one by one.
The plan takes nine months to break down, and eight months to measure.
The time has not yet come to destroy the remaining turbine buildings and boilers.
A man in his 60s who runs a restaurant nearby said, "When I look back at the chimney, it's like a symbol that makes me feel like I'm back in Japan, and I miss it."
The former Japan plant started driving in '967, '89, '2' was abolished in '20.

Local fish, product development, tail eagle, fish market, and so on.
A student who cooks food for Fishnagge and Thailand at the tail Eagle High School in Xingu City.
Four of the three-year-olds at the Post-Engine High School Business Department in Tokyo, Japan, developed fish-naked fish and Thai cooking baskets.
I sold it on the 26th at a cultural festival at the same school.
It's part of a massive partnership for Sathewright High, Japan, which is working to activate the water industry and forest industry, which is the field industry of the region.
The product has been developed by Fishnaggeds, who use the moustaches that are caught in the forest, and cooks the fish with the tail eagle’s breeding diet.
They're targeting young people.
Fishnags have developed three kinds: the addition of tofu, the addition of the tofu and the tail eagle’s special gas shrimp.

In this workshop, we have learned how five instruments are represented in the dance by taking up the "Music" of three elements: music, singing, and dancing.
The three lines were explained to be part of the character's movements and emotions along with the song, and the bow is a symbol of the song and the triadulation of the melody.
In the second half, students actually touched the instrument and felt its tone, and felt its charm as an instrument.
This is the first time in Miyagi to be able to be friendly with the "symmetrical classical music" and be interested in many students about "composite dancing" through musical instruments.

It was not the last time that Japan held its event on the North Coast in 2010.
What is WRC?
The WRC World lari championship is one of the four world championships that the International Association of Motors (FIA) has in common with the Formarawan (F1) and the World's long-term champions (WEC).
Since 1973, it has become the country's most historic and traditional lari champion, and it has been the hardest car racer in the world to run faster on various roads, such as gravel and snowways, as well as on closed roads.
During the 2018 season, the title of the WRC Manukhchallers since 1999, during the second season of the return of Toyota, became a big topic.
This time, the Japan round invitation committee is launched to host Japan's celebration.
As a result, the World Motor Sports Council, the highest body of the FIA (FIA), has decided to host WRC Japan round in 2020.
On the Japanese round trip, both the governors of the Miyagi and ToyotoA GAZO WRT, the president of Toyota Caring WRT, said:
● Governor - General Hidemura of Chimura, Kunihito
"I truly welcome Japan's 2020 host of the FIA World Larrys (WRC).
● Governor Koda Koda-san.
"I'm very happy to say that in 2020, the Tokyo Olympic Paralympic Games will be held, and I'm looking forward to the first World Cup of Japan's FIA World Cup here in ‘Public Country’ to be held, and I'm looking forward to it so far.
● TOOOTOA GAZO Racking WRT representative
"I'm very happy to be able to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
I'd like to thank all my fans for their support."
Many people, including the president of the Council of Motor Sports, have commented on the Japanese round of events.
Japan's round of WRC world lari will be held from November 19 to 22, 2020.
The area is the main road in Chiba City, Kunihito City, Kiyagi City, Kiyagi City, and Kiyagi.
It is announced that the main auditorium will be used as a "love Earth Memorial Park" set up at the site of the 2005 International Fair in Japan.
In addition to a decision-making meeting in Tokyo Motors Show 2019, the Japan Board for the "Central Railly Aichi/Gui 2019" is scheduled to run a test event on November 9, 2019.
I'm not sure if it's a cancer cure, but it's a Tasmanian devil.
Tasmanian devil may be holding the key to cancer treatment.
Medical researchers have found how some cancer cells camouflage.
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devil and human beings.
It is hoped that this discovery will create a new way to treat cancer patients.
What does Tasmanian devil have in common with humans?
It's a cancer cell that's invisible.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCalam Cancer Center in Melbourne, has made a major discovery that if there are cancers that do not respond to immune therapy, they can make a major difference in the treatment for the cancer.
It is possible that he has the key to the deadly facial tumor that threatens the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and animals use a series of proteins called PRC2 to camouflage the markers and that the immune system will no longer attack the cancer.
It's a major challenge for the treatment of micro-cell lung cancers, nerve chromatids, and skin cancers called Merkel cells.
Professor Mark Dawson, a researcher at Peter McCalam, told AAP: "The most important thing in this project is that patients who are resistant to immune treatment may be able to reverse the process."
So, if we can re-use the conventional treatment, we can re-start proteins known as markers, or MHCs, and the immune system may be able to identify cancer cells.
“It’s possible to have a significant impact on lung cancer patients,” says Professor Dawson.
"Public cancer is a global disease.
And maybe we can do it in a much better way.
Researchers hope that this discovery will eventually be used to treat facial tumors in Tasmanian Devilville where cancer cells can also escape detection.
"Closely, the exact same process will take place in the human and Tasmanian devil."
"So far, it has been very difficult to treat the tumor of the Tasmanian devil.
But if a drug that works for us can be used in the Tasmanian devil, it might be useful to control the tumor."
And that's what we're talking about.
Scientists are surprised to discover and marvel at the solar system’s present understanding of the formation of the planet, which is a small planet called the red dwarf, which revolves around a small star called a red dwarf.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas planet GJ3512b was released around the main red dwarf.
It's like a star. It's like a star.
In this case, however, there's no great difference between the size of stars and planets.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% of the size of the Sun, but the planets around it have at least half the mass of Jupiter, our largest planet.
"Yes, it's a surprise now that Juan Carlos Morales, an astrophysicist at the Catalonia Space Institute at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences, who led this study published in Science Science.
The theoretical structure model shows that stars with low mass usually become planets of a small planet like Earth and the smaller Pluto.
In this case, we found giant gas planets similar to Jupiter, around very small stars.
The planet, which consists mainly of gas like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Color Alto Observatory in Spain.
It's a planet that's going to orbit around stars, and it's going to orbit around stars.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
We're not just talking about the size of a giant planet, but about 35 percent larger than Jupiter.
It's darker than the Sun because it's a low energy source, and it's about 3,800 degrees below the surface temperature.
So we're going to have a red color, so we're going to have a red color.
While there are signs that the second planet is now orbiting the stars, Moroles said that the third planet may have been released from its system in the past, explaining the elliptical orbit of the planet.
The planets are produced from the same disk made up of intergalactic gases and dust that created the stars that they orbit.
The most powerful planetary formation model known as the "core collection" model is that the object comes from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding atmosphere is created by the pull of the planet's egg.
So, we're going to use a model called the self-sustenance model to explain this unusual system of planets.
"In this case, the primitive planetary disk around the stars that were born may have been a little larger and lower than we thought.
So, if you look at the disk, you can see that it's very dense.
They can grow until they collapse and form a planet.
Dell's employee, fed toy-dips full of stimulants to his colleagues.
Marion County Sheriff's office, Cassandra Medina Hernández, is accused of feeding a colleague with a bean dip.
On Thursday, Cassandra Ani Medina Hernández of Albani was charged with the suspicion that she was giving in to a class B heavy charge, as well as taking in other people's restricted drugs.
The charges were caused by what happened on September 9th at a walkway grocery store in Jefferson County.
According to the estimates of the depositions obtained from OredonLive.com, a suspect colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked the deputy attorney for a taste because he saw Medina Hernández making bean dips.
According to the deposition, the victim spoke to an agent who had never had met a methamphetamine before, and “I thought it tasted strange after having eaten a few words, but I didn’t think it was drugs.”
When the woman got back to work, her stomach got sick and her legs became swollen.
Albany Democrut Held says that women may have been exposed to methamphetamines at local hospitals where they went.
According to The Smoking Gun, another walkway employee said Medina Hernández "telled him that he had taken drugs in his victim's food" while a third employee said he sent a message saying that the suspect accidentally had accidentally taken the methamphetamine into the bean dip.
According to the Oregon Live article, the surveillance video I seized from Deli shows Medina Hernández turning his back on the camera and pulling something out of the brager while he's clinging behind the microwave.
Then he stands up and wipes his nose and walks to the table and places his bean dip on a small paper plate.
The police said it was like putting something from the brager on a plate.
According to Oregon Statsman Journal, the sheriff said he does not think there are customers who have been exposed to contaminated food.
Medina Hernández is being held in Marion County prison for $550,000 on bail.
According to the Smoking Gun, Medina Hernández’s long-term record of arrest has been marked by violence, robbery, theft, methamphetamine, possession of methane, and possession of control weapons.

In a 27-day press conference in the East Sea, the President of the East Sea, Kinko Shinko, stated that the issue of the Iikawa River in connection with the construction of the Miyagi tunnel in the south of the central Shinjuku chain, “the need to organize and divide the challenges that are being discussed with Shibuya, before the construction process begins”, he has re-embarred his attitude toward the early beginning of the construction.
In particular, we're going to talk to each other at the meeting place and the front.
"I think we can do that, but we can't do that."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our idea.
The province is deeply concerned about the inability of the water from the tunnel to be returned to the Great Ai River.
"I'll do it if I can, but it's hard to see from the safety of the project."
He denied that the route change mentioned by Governor Katsumoto is impossible.
The impact of the operation, he pointed to three locations in the southern Alps tunnel, Shinkawa Station, and the well-known railway station as a place where construction is particularly slow, saying, "I can't afford to be able to afford it, but I’m concerned most about the jugular district."

The public hospital in Saga, Japan, has five medical institutions and social media.
The Ministry of Health and Labor has announced the name of the hospital on 26 days.
The proportion of medical institutions in the province surveyed is 38%, and the nation's top zero, and there are already three places in which to integrate and relocate.
The names of the hospitals in the province are: the National Hospital for the Organization of Hospitals (Minori).
In the meantime, the Miyagi Hospital and the Tatsuya Civil Hospital in Tatsuya, Japan, have organized a joint plan to build a new hospital in Tatsuya, Japan, and the Iwayama hospital has been relocated to Makayama, Nagasaki.
The hospital is the center of the city's regional comprehensive care system, and in the last few years, it has been running the black market.
"The hospital has to be left entirely for the benefit of its residents."
The director of Japan's Osama Hospital said he didn't hear from the province, but he insisted on attending the Regional Medical Project meeting in the province and responding in the light of the debate.
"The community health organization which runs the Iwayama Hospital in Iwayama, Japan, believes that the announcement is not a mechanical decision in the direction of the public hospital, but it is a request to re-exposit at a local health meeting in each municipality."
The staff of the Department of Medical Services, which explains the country's thoughts to each medical institution, will want to hear a lot about how the victim will run the hospital in the future.
In some cases, she might ask for a review of her medical subjects, or further reduction in her hospital care."

According to the third party, the students had been lowered in the toilet and demanded cash.
The royal family's secret:
The Royal family must travel around the world for hundreds of lifetimes as part of its official duties.
It's usually easy to use a private plane, a royal plane, that moves royals around the world for important events and performances.
Of course, I have the privilege of having my own personal plane.
There is no limit to the number of luggage, and the Royal family is able to invite as many as they like, including unexpected passengers.
According to a recently aired channel 5 documentary, the Queen and Prince Philip are not the only customers of the royal plane.
During "The Secret of the Royal Flight" show, the queen's former pilot revealed that she and her family often ride with her hairy guests.
Bob Seas said, "I sometimes ride a very important Royal Dog like a very important royal customer."
It is not surprising that Queen Cawgi's dog is famous and asks her to take her pet with her to travel.
Queen Elizabeth has been fond of dogs since she was a child and has been a queen for over 30 years.
In 2007, it was claimed that he had five dogs: Monty, Emma, Lynett, Willow, Holly.
In addition to these five, four are added: the five cokers' Bissagniel's Bissus, the Occupy, the Flash, the Spooky, and the five of the mixed dogs, Daxfung and Cogi, Berry Balkan and Candies.
The staff on the royal plane must be very busy.
The royal staff was seen putting their dogs on the lawn before boarding, and asking them to add to their expenses, says Seas.
I'm glad I've never had an accident before.
On the show, the Queen's luggage was known for its shocking amount.
According to the broadcaster, the Queen's luggage was 12 tons on a 44,000-mile tour of the British Federation in 1953.
I'm going to give you an example.
But the queen is not the only one who likes fashion.
Lady Cambridge also says that she has her own taste for carrying her clothes, and she says she takes a sheet every time she wears a dress.

Former senator of Alabama, Jack Edwards died, nine years old.
In the first wave of Republicans in Deep South, Jack Edwards, elected in Alabama for the 0th term, died on Friday.
Edward's family announced through a representative that he died in his home in Fair Hope after his battle with pancreatic cancer.
As Republicans raged in Deep South, a number of Republicans in Alabama were elected to Congress, but Edwards, as one of the first waves, was first elected to the US House of Representatives in 1965.
Edwards served a zero term in Congress.
According to the family's announcement, Edwards was recently asked what kind of world he wanted to leave for the generation of great-grandchildren and said he wanted to return to the ceremony.
According to his family, he said he wanted his great-grandchildren to grow up in a country where his daily conversations and efforts to solve his country's problems were restored.
Kay, the governor of Ivyalabama said that Mr. Edwards served the state and state in the highest esteem.
He also told me he was going to raise a half flag in the Alabama State Palace in honor of his condolences.
"Mr. Edwards was a true public servant and the biggest politician of the state of Alabama.
We lost one of the best politicians in the state.
The night before an apology for the Heli accident, the deputy Minister of Defense posted a post by the Executive Minister of Defense.
Deputy Minister of Defense Yamamoto posted on Twitter during the 26th of the night.
I deleted it about 8:30 a.m. on the 27th.
In the final report of the crash of a war helicopter in Katsuya City last February, the Deputy Minister for Defense Yamamoto, who had been in Saga to explain the cause and apologize for the accident, posted on Twitter: “It's delicious” in the province’s firehouse at night.
After meeting with the Governor on the 27th, I deleted the post.
Yamamoto came to Saga on a business trip tonight, after 1:30 p.m. on 26th.
With pictures of the Minister of Defense, Iwada Iwada, who was present at the meal, wrote to Sakata, "A chicken is delicious!"
Yamamoto then added on Twitter that "the chicken" was wrong:
The Minister of Defense, Konoro Konoro, was asked at a post conference 27 A.M. and said, "I'll watch the tweet."
On the 27 afternoon following the explanation to 3 cities in the province, Yamamoto, who was interviewed by the press, said about the content of the post: "If my message makes you uncomfortable, it's not my intention."
He highlighted the removal by his own decision and avoided making clear whether the tweet was inappropriate or not.
One of the municipal officials, described by Yamamoto-san on 27 days, said, "What are you thinking?
Yamamoto-san was elected to the Confederate Court four times.
I'm currently in office for renovating the cabinet this month.
In an accident, a girl in a house in the crash site was hit and two members of the crew on board the helicopter died.
Michelle Obama, put Megan Marks on Instagram, and she's called "inspiration."
Michelle Obama praised Megan Marks on a friendly Instagram Thursday and called the Duke of Sussex "a discreet leader who breaks the mold and makes the world a better place."
The Duke and Prince Harry have been visiting young people's receptions and meeting with Obama Foundation officials this week in an official visit to South Africa with their son, Archie Harrison Mount Basten.
"Thank you for breaking old habits and making the world a better place, my friend, Prince Sussex Prince @sussexproyal," the former president wrote very kindly.
Obama posted a photo of the wife, Megan, who posed with the members of the foundation, adding: "Whether you meet with Obama Foundation officials or support the girls around the world seeking an adequate education, it is inspiring to many."
Megan, an actress in the suit, was a guest editor in the September issue of the British magazine Vogue and interviewed Mrs. Obama.
In that frank conversation, the ex-President of the country repeated how motherhood and motherhood changed her.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said that being a mother is like being in a higher class of giving up.
My job is almost always to find the self they want to be and to give them a proper distance to grow up.
It's not the ideal for children as parents or for their own childhood, but essentially to find out who they are.
In her interview at Good Housekeeping magazine, Obama, who sees the world's spotlight pressure, advised the Duke a little:
"Sometimes the pressure from ourselves and people around us is too great."
And that's what I'm going to do in the next video.
The first few months at the White House, instead of starting to work eagerly, the girls began to live well and take care of the new friends.

Jause Jr.Vy, a young boy, and a storm-and-SMAP song in Galahua!
The "Beauty" stage is fantasizing.
A six-man group of Janes Jr.'s boys showed their live performances at "Rakun Gels Award 2019 AUTUMN/WINTER" during the 1,000-lean festival.
Look at the picture.
Fujiyaki was attracted to the audience in Ismail.
The event is the largest fashion and music event in Japan since the first time in 2010.
There are many models and artists in the audience, with fashion runways and live performances.
When the boy is introduced as a secret artist, there is a yellow cheer in the audience.
When six of the men came to the stage, the "Sakisaki" was right, they marched up to the runway in the middle of the stage to join the fans.
We start with FIRE STORM while the cheers don't sound.
The following group of seniors, "Jamaese Meadley", will play a popular song with such songs as "ARA SHI" in the storm and "One Flower in the World" in the SMAP.
Finally, she ended up with the original song of the boy, "Cosmic Melody."
No complaints, no credit card hotel owners, no liquor licenses.
Washington - D.C. - The D.A.-D.A. Board of Alcohol and Alcohol has rejected the appeal that Washington should review the liquor licenses of the local Trump International Hotel, as they question the fitness of its owners.
The committee did not have the license to sue three members of Congress, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders because most of them did not live in Washington or have fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the appeal to cancel the hotel's alcohol rights in accordance with state law that requires an application to obtain a license to sell alcohol.
In the first case filed last summer, Trump accused the President of assault and the repeated deceptions, claiming that he violated state law.
The case was dismissed because the permit was already granted.
The second appeal was filed to update the permit.
First harvest of honey gathered by Bentley's "Flying Bees"!
It's called "Fooing Beets."
In May 2019, set-up beekeeping began on the crew plant grounds in Bentley, England.
The workers were not less than the workers who worked at the crew factory, and the beekeepers gathered over 100 bottles of honey from just two hives.
How did Bentley get to do beekeeping on the factory grounds where the cars were built?
I'd like to taste this!
This is the honey Bentley hands (11 of them).
Peter Bosh, director of the manufacturing department in Bentley, commented:
"In an effort to help preserve local biodiversity, earlier this year we set up our first hive in the vast grounds of the crew factory.
Beekeepers have observed beekeepers gathering nectar from wildflowers and surrounding mountains.
And we've seen that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it's amazing to see that there's so much harvest in the first year.
Bentley's campaign to become head of the Sastennavre high-end automakers through the crew factory and our business, is also part of the work of raising honey bees.
We've been working on this for a long time.
We are very pleased to have received the first harvest safely, and we plan to set up more hives next year to increase the production of Bentley honey.
And that's what we're going to do.
We're going to be doing a lot of work to do our part."
Then, in September of the same summer, it was completed removing the frames from the hives, putting them on a telepath, filtering out the fallen honey, and then filling them with bottles.
I'm going to show you how to do this.
The design of the label was done by Louis McCalam, the designer of Bentley's interior.
A bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but is a gift to the host and guests to visit the crew factory.
Great Britain loves teatime.
And I'm going to show you one of the best ways to do this.
The Crebrand Police, a continuing scandal, the newspaper The Sun, which is considered the worst report against corruption in the United Kingdom.
Police officers have branded the worst in England.
The Cleveland Police reported corruption and were labeled inappropriate in all fields.
Cleveland P.D. says that there's been a "healthful deterioration" in the area, and the police's director, Phil Gomley.
In six years, five police chiefs have been replaced and are now facing a new call for dismantling.
According to the report, they stopped crimes, arrested suspects, and failed to defend the vulnerable.
Phil Gomley, police director, said that since the last investigation, there's been a major deterioration.
Police chief Mike Ville resigned after less than a month in office, but he was under investigation for several undisclosed charges about his actions.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for gross illegal activity.
Lieutenant Simon Harwood filed an illegal investigation committee last year because he led his colleagues to engage in sexual activity.
He resigned from the police.
"This is a fact that the police have officially confirmed that they have collapsed," said the conservative mayor of Tees Valley, Ben Hautin.
Now is the time for the Ministry of the Interior to intervene."
The police chief Richard Lewis said: "It has been improved, but I am responsible for the progress of reform."
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No one knows what's going to happen.
"We now believe that we are involved in a cover-up incident and that it may take some time to investigate," Perrossi told the Congress in an interview with CNN.
“I’m going to do the job I started based on the actual relationship and the time it takes to discover it,” Perossi said.
In the White House's record this week, Trump found out that the Ukrainian president Warodimir Selensky had asked the former vice president of the United States, Joe Biden, and his son to investigate him in 2020.
The phone records show that Trump also asked Selensky to help Bar and his private counsel, Rudy Juliani.
Mr. Cards denies injustice.
CNN reported on Thursday that more than a week before the official hearing, the first person to notice the inside charge of the Trump in Ukraine was the Justice Department's National Security attorney.
The Justice Department, accused by intelligence officials, decided that Trump's phone meeting would not be a violation of political funding.
In response to the question of whether to testify, Perrosi said on Friday that the intelligence committee would decide who should be questioned:
But Peroxi added that he thinks he's become a criminal.
Yeah, it's been a long time.
"Because the name of the bar had been given to him," Perrosi said, mentioning that Trump mentioned the name of the attorney general on the phone meeting with the president of Ukraine in July.
It's interesting that Mr. Barr will be forced to judge on the charge.
Peroxi was "very concerned" about the source's inside accusers, who attacked the accusers on Thursday, after suggesting that they were different from the way they used to treat the spies.
I think what the President says is too irresponsible and dangerous.
He also said that "the president's uttering a shocking statement about someone who might have provided information to the whistleblowers is a significant harm to the unity of the government."
Perrossi, who went through the suspicions of trying to pressure foreign heads for political benefit on Tuesday, announced that he was officially to discuss the war on Trump, writing a historic step:
The phone calls are contained in a statement published on Thursday, claiming that Trump used his power to "seek intervention in Ukraine" in the next 2020 presidential election.
The whistleblower also claimed that the lawyers of the White House had instructed officials to remove the phone records from the cabinet's computer system and replace them with a system for special sensitive information.
Crystal Palace, Christian Foreword, Benteke, banned for speeding.
Premium League star, Christian Benteke, who was arrested for two speed violations in two months, is about to be banned from driving.
Crystal Palace's 28-year-old forwarder admitted that he drove his own Bentley on the 20th of January and drove at 80 miles an hour at a speed of 50 miles an hour.
In March, the Belgians were taken in Patney, south-west London, by a speeding security camera traveling at 89 miles per hour and more than 40 miles per hour.
Benteke lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey.
Benteke was found guilty of both offenses in a single hearing by a security judge in the beginning of July, who handed down the verdict of a minor crime.
9.2% of high school students in Taiwan have "experienced" rates of non-preservation in health authorities.
Health and Health Department announced the results of a study on World Prostitution Day on September 26 and the experience of high school students in Taiwan.
It's a little bit more complicated than that.
It has also been shown that about 1 out of every 5 of these women is not pregnant.
The study was conducted in 2017 for students in high school, technical high school, and high school.
And this is what we're going to do in the next video.
On the other hand, 22.6% of 15 to 17-year-old men and women said they did not get pregnant because of their recent sexual activity, more than 19.2% of the last time.
In the first video, we'll see that both boys and girls have increased by 28.8 percent (22.6 percent) and 16.2 percent (as much as 14.5%).
The station pointed out that today's youth are getting more information on the Internet and are more likely to be biased by false information.
It calls for good knowledge, as well as increased risk of pregnancy, if there is no birth control.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Ghana: Kofi Manu, concerned about the formation of the Judicial Committee
Kofi Manu, director and football analyst and director of Sécondi Hasaccas, expressed concern about the structure of the next Ghana Football Association (GFA) hearing committee:
He expressed his frustration over including President Frank Davids.
In his interview with the GNA sport, the chairman of the committee said that the results of the investigation were beneficial, and he questioned whether it was fair to include the chairman:
The judicial committee should be made up of a fair and outside member who has nothing to do with each member and has no prior interests.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote to Osei Kwak Palma about the reward:
He's also known as the Olympic champion.
For these two reasons, Manu countered that his commission should not be allowed.
Manu, who said that attending the Olympic Committee would bring benefits to the chairman from his relationship with the club, suggested prejudice and injustice to the committee:
The members of the committee were scheduled to leave on October 4 after they started the ceremony at the GFA's Office on Thursday, September 19.
The chairman is Frank Davis, the Corposited Garbanins consultant, and the chairman, Mary Barnore and Emmanuel Darkwar.
The other committees have marketing and sales director Reginald Lariea, and lawyer Richard Apocavi for sports reasons.
A study by Fukui's Institute of Technology found that 54% of the small companies in Fukui, Fukui, consider the country's minimum wage to be “a minimum wage”.
While 90 percent of the companies have hired them, the percentage of companies that say they've got their schedules has remained between 50 and 50 percent of new and middle-aged employees, while the number of companies that have been hired has remained 30 percent.
The company that said "I agree" to raise $700 an hour had information (00%), construction (70/6%), and wholesale (6-7%).
The majority of the "reverse" were manufacturing (5.9%) and service (60.9%), including food and lodging (60.9%).
The officials of the conference think that the percentage of opposition is high for part-time and full-time industry, but it’s difficult to get people and that many companies are thinking about increasing the cost of labor.
The average amount of money paid when the company said, "No" is up, the average amount of money was $95.00 (US$4 to 829).
"In March 9th, we heard about the adoption of the company, that a senior employee had a 6-percent degree, a middle-aged 54-5%, and a non-disciplinary 4%.
It was 8.6% who didn't recruit.
The percentage of companies that were "responsible" was 44-7% freshmen, 50-3% middle-aged, and the irregularity stayed at 3-%.
In particular, the transportation and construction operations (24 percent, 38 percent) suffered.
In all, 86% of the people in the audience have a job assignment, and the number of applicants in high order has been listed as low-recognition, low-income company, or low-income terms, and so on.
Many of the initiatives in the adoption effort were called for more introductions and information for the second and third year after graduation.
Some have asked for support in their approach to students, including providing PR opportunities to students from outside the province and supporting various internships.
As to the side and business that the country advocates in its growth strategy, "5% said they already recognized it."
"I'm going to admit it now" and "three-thirds of the total" showed recognition.
There were 64.4% of the companies that said "No": construction (82.8%), retail (73.7%), manufacturing (72.7%).
The investigation took place on July 9 to August 2, targeting 1,000 companies.
I got an answer from 298 companies (298%).

JR's line, which was seen as the start of the 27th morning, has resumed its drive as a result of typhoon 17 hit the track.
The JR's and Saomura's direct line has returned to normal since the start of the 27th morning.
JR's line is midway between the river shelf and his station.
The train in Nagasaki had fewer books and more diamonds.
According to the branch office of JR Kyuszaki, the 26th day recovery was completed after running a test-drive train in the middle of the night on 27th.
Typrick, the voice of the day before the battle with the rich.
"This is the moment to show," said Justin Tiprick as he entered Australia's battle against the World Cup Sun, where Wales will determine the course of future tournaments.
If Wales wins Wavraz, it will be the hotest candidate for the pool D, which will probably ensure the finals against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia, which has been fighting for 15 years wins the 14th World War against Wales, is the best eight-line match between Typric and England.
"Yes, of course, I'd like to challenge both teams to finish up with the group top."
We've had a tough fight before, but it was good to win last fall.
Australia's going to pay off a lot of debt, but it's not going to happen until we've got to win again.
Before I came here, I knew this game was a mountain.
And now it's a real show.
Wales has won the World Cup against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and the victory over Wallaraz 32 years ago is the third world war.
And under Warren Gatland, all three teams in the Southern Hemisphere weight grade have won seven out of 41.
Wales stopped losing the test match last November at 13 but Typric is one of several representatives who won the game at 9-6 and is one of the players playing at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
He was told that before that victory, he didn't think he could win.
Yes, the game was hard, and maybe, you know, everyone thought they couldn't win, but I don't know.
"I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but I'm going to do it.
If Wales is to win, the breakdown battle between Michael Hooper and David Pocock, worshiped as Back Law, will be the key.
Typric, who has been in the 67 international competitions since then, has had some previous experiences of fighting against both players and knows exactly what is waiting for him.
"They're definitely the world's level backers."
I always know I'm going to be in a tough game when I'm going to fight Worldglass Buckro.
They're always at the highest level in the world.
I know exactly what kind of game this is gonna be.
Popcock is one of the world's best backers in the fight, Michael is more aggressive, but he knows rugby better than going where it is necessary to go.
I'd rather fight the world's best players than fight backrows that aren't as strong.
I want to fight the best, and I have to be good when I fight those two.
I'm not saying this Sunday is the final level, but it's a big game for us in the World Cup.
The momentum is important.
If you keep doing good performances, you'll be able to play hard and not lose.
"The Lord's Watch, the locals are silent, the Irish, the shocked W-cup newspaper Atses.
On the 28th, a local fan will watch the Japan war with a rugby W cup in a pub in Dublin, Ireland's capital.
Local fans running into pubs from morning to morning in Ireland who had been strong against Japan's national champions during the World Cup of rugby, were in their heads with no idea of the unexpected defeat.
Public broadcast RTE can't hide the shock of being "a brave Japan's amazing watch."
The game started in Ireland after 8:00 a.m. on the ground.
The pub in Dublin, the capital of FB Carney, met fans early in the morning.
Before the match, I was confident that I would win, but as the end of the game got worse, I heard a similar cry: "No".
When the whistle sounded at the end of the game, the whole shop was silent.
Japan's Occupation Bureau has proposed a procedure for the release of the ocean.
A meeting of the government subcommittee to discuss how to handle the nuclear power plant.
Tokyo's sub-governmental subcommittee on 27 days to consider the continued treatment of the water supply at Fukushima nuclear power plant, presented the equipment and specific procedures that are expected to be used to dispose of the land and the environment as a way of disposal.
In view of the presence of radioactive tritium and other factors, we have checked the concentration of the matter, and we have an emergency stop when we detect an abnormality before release.
"Let the board know how much time it takes for the procedure presented at the meeting this day" "it makes no sense for the release and some relief after the Fukushima fishing operation has been restored.
We should consider the social timeline as well.

In East Enders, the column highway was surprised by the sudden bombing news of Whitney Dean, which caused the column to return to its mistress, and the hot tension of the column and Ben Mitchell was about to explode again.
But are you gonna regret this hot moment when you two are in love with each other?
While the column has been moving slowly since they were willing to help Ben, the column says it's been a pleasure to see Ben's weakness and his gentleness, and it's been a bit of fun to try to date him.
Tonight, Whitney's back from vacation, feeling a lot better than before.
It is clear that she was very effective when she left Walford shortly after it became clear that she was having an affair with someone who was supposed to be her husband.
Whitney came home and started talking to the column.
Soon, however, Whitney will find out the new facts and beat up the columns, and the columns will roar.
The column is upset, Jay Mitchell is worried when he sees the empty columns in Queen Vic.
A drunken, emotional column enters Ben, exposes everything that has happened and blames him.
Ben takes the anger of the column in a calm, words of comfort, and soon when they kiss, it turns into passion.
But what are you two gonna do now?
They tried to date the next week, but Ben gave them the materials to think about their relationship and everything they were trying to do together would be ruined.
But a new column of confidence in the face of gay fathers is determined to fight to get what they want and what they deserve.
This kiss episode of East End will be broadcast on BBC at 8:30 Friday night, September 27.
Is it true that if you take 90 percent of the gala with you, it will be a gift from the geisha?
A series of problems over the Gala issue that motivated the black market to operate against anti-social forces have also been closed.
At a meeting on July 22, President Okamoto said, on average, that the company says "5:5:6:4" and that there is nothing like that.
If you take 90 percent of the "9:1" ratio, it is estimated that there was a gift from the geisha and the investors' view that it would cost them taxes, and more than 30,000 tweets have been retweeted on Twitter.
If the sum is "9:1", it might be taxed.
I've been told by the tax officer, Fujito.
● In the first place, the law is not subject to a tax.
I don't know if you'll be able to answer this question from the tax office.
It's not about the individual, it's about the law, it's not about the tax.
So let's say that my share of my work is "9:1" and my share of my work is "9:1"
So that's what we're going to do.
So we're going to have to pay the tax.
So let's say that we're asking the question, what is the total amount of money that we're getting?
And I think I'm going to declare the amount of money that I'm getting.
If you're not aware of it, you're not going to give it to the individual.
So if you're dealing with something that clearly has a price (for example, real estate trading) and you're dealing with a price that's away from the original price, it's a matter of calculating taxes.
And that's what the third party can't decide on their own.
I'm sorry.
In 2008, after working at a bank after graduating from the university, I signed up as a tax collector.
College instructors, seminars, writing and so on.
So here's what I'm going to show you.
White House, I couldn't reach the bottom of my head.
The White House officials were excited on Thursday against the pressure of the new Democrats, who explained that there is a sense of "great panic" over the lack of plans to deal with the new reality.
Someone close to the White House said about the atmosphere of the west wing that "anxiety, anxiety and concern" seems to be increasing regarding the possibility that an insider's appeal could cause great damage to the president and some of his neighbors.
He said, "You don't have much to do with the fact that there's no real."
"The White House officials don't have a clear plan for the situation, and since the usual measures which may not have been applied to the president's success, they are not sure how to proceed, they are not likely to be swept away by the news reported next time," the official joked.
Another person who is familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as “great shock” as it increases the likelihood of the President’s going to react in an out-of-the- way way and be“ out of control”.
Another source says that during interrogations, the pressure of the president is expected to increase daily, and that some of the members of the president’s close friends who consider him to be more “stirring”.
They are increasingly concerned about the potential for unpredictable behavior and violent attacks by unexpected means, and are worried about the president and politics in the election year environment.
In the face of the greatest threat ever faced by the president of the United States, playing cards have become part of the attack or changing the defense, such as restoring the strategy that he considered effective in Russia during Robert Morler's investigations.
The cards tried to ignore the request of the president of Ukraine to cooperate with the investigation of political opponents. They sought to attract attention to the actions of the Democrats and the candidate Joe Biden, and to undermine the trust of the whistleblower because of the cause of the opposition.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the trials of the Mollah investigation, but now they are beginning to feel the difference.
The president of the country, who has been known for his power, said that he seemed to be in a press conference on Wednesday and that he was in the situation.
The cards enjoyed asking questions about Russia's investigations, but they did not seem willing to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that the damage can be reduced by arguing that there is someone who knows the fact that the controversial President Trump and Volozimir Selensky did not have direct information about the conversation with the president of Ukraine.
It is also common for the president to be attacked, but this fact increases the support of supporters to defend him.
However, a Republican strategyner near the White House points out that the basic support rate of the president is already very high and that it does not have much effect on the acquisition of new supporters.
"In particular, if a bullet interferes with the bill and keeps the news all the time, there's no advantage in focusing on the President's bullets for the next four months."
Another source said that those who claimed that the bullet could help the president do not fully understand how uncertain his response will be.
Concerned White House officials are calling on their advisers to organize a team of warheads.
According to the authors of the project, the initiative is still in its early stages, but it remains undiscovered as to how and how it will be carried out.
However, he said that there is a need for a clear leader to organize an organized legal and communications strategy, and to counter the fact that the publishing of a critical insider's letter and the publishing of it is necessary to organize a public relations operation aggressively.
Information on the situation clearly shows the lack of long-term strategic perspectives, including the fact that the Secretary of State of State Mike Pupéo and Stephen Munewsin said they would not be able to publish documents in 48 hours that they would not be able to publish a note about a call to the President of Ukraine in Trump.
Now more pressure is expected from Robert Morler's investigations that he spoke mostly in silence, and according to the person involved, the one who might be involved in the outbreak is Cory Luwandowski, who was former head of the campaign's task force outside the Trump.
But Luwandowski told the NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he will be the leader of such initiatives.
"I've done everything I can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but I've never talked to him or his close friends about joining a team that is fighting back against this false story," he said.
The external attorney for Trump during the Moller investigation, Jay Seklo, is also getting involved in the initiative.
In an interview with NBC News, she said, "I'll handle the problem properly."
Emmet Flood, who was involved in the Clinton bombing and who led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, was short of experience with the current White House legal adviser Pat Siploon, and the White House is currently short of lawyers with experience in the field.
Information on the White House's strategy generally stated that the authorities are far from building a team of people and strategy teams, but they recognize that they need someone to be organized and to take the lead in the efforts and political struggles that all of them have.

I've got a boyfriend, and I've got a long-range love for his job.
He told me I'm going to marry one day, but I couldn't see the finish line.
How can we make the situation a friend and connect to marriage?
I was asked the solution by Professor Toshikawa I, who lectures on "State in Love" at the University of Japan.
Professor Sungawa's advice, must be read.
I'm worried about you.
I'm wondering if I should continue to have boyfriends in a long-range relationship.
I want to continue living in Kanin, where I work and live, but his work is Tokyo.
It's possible that he's moving abroad.
We're told to marry in the future, but we don't see any goals at all.

● Couples who get married out of love at a distance are a minority.
C is in a long-range relationship with a guy who's been dating for a year and a half.
And there's a lot of people who say, "I'm going to be tested at a distance and they're going to be stronger."
As for distant love, it is well known that DeNAtra's survey of 1147 people conducted in August 2017 has found that only 16% of couples who have come from distant love to marriage.
Because love is done with five senses, it becomes more and more connected by looking at the other person, listening to the voice, holding hands, smelling, and kissing.
And that's what we're talking about here.
It's not easy to keep in touch with people who are hearing-only.
And there's also cost problems.
If you go to the other person's house, you will be spending more time and effort on the road, and your body will be in a holiday to heal the tiredness of your work.
I'm afraid I'm going to be scared when I get home.
- So, when it's too far away, do we have to split up?
I think it's going to work if you're a couple who can endure a lot of times without seeing each other.
You're engaged in a year, or you're coming back from a shift in two years.
If you don't see any future points, it might be hard.

Devin Nuñez, blamed the Democrats for demanding "node photo of Trump".
Senator Devin Nuñez, California, cannot be patient with the idea that President Donald Trump will be investigated.
On Thursday, in a comment defending the president, he condemned the Democrats who tried to get the picture of the president.
Senator Nunes, the Republican head of the House's Special Intelligence Committee, filed a petition on the court's statement that Trump is asking for an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son:
He said that Ukraine's suspicions were a "Glossic show created by the left party and its media property" and accused the Democrats of wanting to see the President's full naked picture.
"The Democrats of this special commission have negotiated with anyone they think is Ukrainian to get a photo of Trump Node."
It’s only natural to ask why the Democrats are so excited to beat the president, when they have the chance within a year.
After Nunez's rebuke, the senior political writer for the Huffpost, Jennifer Bendley, decided to see if the Democrats are trying to find out.
The only answer I've ever received is the Connecticut Democratic Congressman Jim Heims, who is wondering if his answer is a red-hearted truth for many other members of the party.
Medicate Dotcom speculates that the Nuñez Nodiist comment may be related to "more and more unconfirmed details" written in controversial Steel documents.
In a notorious report collected by former British agent Christopher Steele about a shocking complaint against Trump, he noted that in a hotel room in Moscow, there was a torch watching prostitutes urinating, and that was suggested to exist.
Origami, wallet and real cards.
Money, loans, insurance, investment (Impress Watch) - Yeo! News
Origami Wallet is an application that allows money transfers and money transfers (to be moved) in addition to payments made by Origami Pey.
Charging's working as well.
We're going to start financial services, including loans, investments, insurance, and so on.
So, we're going to use the financial functions of paying, moving, charging, borrowing, increasing, and getting ready.
"I want to create a new financial service that will solve the problems of young people who have to live with pensions, low interest rates, and other problems related to money."
The advantage of Origi Wallet is that if you have an Origami ID, you can complete the transaction in Simress, and you can get some time information.
He also explained that it's not only the Origami app, but also the development of it on a partner's app to make available services even if they don't have the Origami app.
I'm going to give you a couple of examples.
When the rest of the money was needed, he decided to finish it on his Origami app.
As regards insurance, I present to you a partner company, the Nissei Reservation and First Life.
I talked to these two companies, both of whom have data and insight and are planning to expand their insurance products along with their life events.
The financial services are now registered to the necessary administrations and are being launched and expanded.
▪ "Origami Technologies" for effective use of data.
On the same day, Oligami announced that the company will launch a “Origami Technologies” to support effective use of data, including the company’s data, as well as its company's Pay to digitize customer connections through the process provided by Origami.
Origami Network, a company that partneres with Origami and other organizations such as Origami Network, has found that effective use of data, such as sales and non-generating data, and storage, processing, analysis, and so on, becomes a challenge.
In it, Origami Technologies supports the acquisition and analysis of unstructured data, along with the structured data owned by their company, and their partnerships.
They are contributing to effective data and to the creation and transformation of new business models with digital technology and data.
"Many companies are now collecting data and creating customer connections," Origami, President of Oligami, explained, "and the next phase is how to use data to develop a business model.
"I want to create innovations for the next phase with the data created in Origami Network and the data from many companies."
I'll show you the details of the service.
In addition, Origami Conference 2019 lists the further initiatives of Origami, such as delivering coupons to Smaho when rain falls, and also the conveniences of maneuverive technology.
Also, on the wrong-doing compensation, Origami Pey still provides full compensation, which is clearly defined as a system, such as a rule of use.
It also suggested that locals should work as a support officer in cooperation with the Tourism Society and other organizations.
In July of this year, a meeting was held in the Osaka, Osaka, Japan, on September 7.
The people who were involved in this show, they've presented the national anthem for Konohara-san.
About 140 Japanese participants, including the director of the Tokyo headquarters of the Japanese Ministry of Education, as well as the director of the Japanese Association of Music and Arts Association.
At the ceremony, President Nakamura met me.
"I still can't believe he's gone," he said, while preparing for the "Sunday's meeting," he missed how wonderful and great Akiko-kun was and how he died.
On top of that, he said, "If only we could do some more work."
After the silence was offered, I was introduced to Mesage from the Director General of the Union of American Arts and Arts, the director of the Chuo Idea International Institute.
It's possible that biofuel research can reduce emissions.
In recent years, even though electric cars and Tesseract trucks and Semi have a monopoly on the news, the only thing that can be seen in the sky is the airplane.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that allows renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bressler, professor of biological and environmental sciences in Alberta, launched the project in 2003.
The professor's lab is developing hydrocarbon fuel from such oil waste as oil from restaurants, animal renderings, and canola oil.
The technology, unlike the energy and other biofuels, can be used to produce low quality oil, and carbon emissions are 85% less than crude oil based fuels, and can be used for other industrial waste in the process.
This technology also affects the regeneration of hydrocarbons found in oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bressler said, "This technology is actually achieved in the first generation by hydrocarbons itself in diesel gas."
Although it is a new alternative to biofuel use, conventional biofuel technology tends to become cold and unstable, creating serious problems for high-level aircraft.
"The problem with jet fuel, it's almost like a dilemma," Dr. Bressler said.
It's not worth a diesel, but it's more than that.
In Dr. Bressler's lab, we now have two options for biofuels for jets.
So, we're going to talk about two different approaches.
The second option is to continue to study chemical reactions that are partially developed and maintain fuel stability in low temperatures.
The second option, Dr. Bressler said, "We can try it at the reactor so that the reaction changes a little."
This option is very risky.
As airlines, Canada, and the U.S. Army are increasing their investment in renewable options, Foge Hydrocarbons, a child company at the University of Alberta, is working on production.
“They predict that someday someone will put a carbon tax on them,” he said.
I'd like to make an alternative for the worst.
Today, Forge runs an experimental plant near the waste management center of Edmont, and recently invested four million US dollars from Rocky Martin to help build 25 million US dollars' production plant in Sonbla, Ontario.
The plant will produce about 19 million biofuels a year.
Dr. Bressler says that carbon reduction is about 85%, but that's why the reduction rate is not increased, such as the transportation and production of fuel.
"As an engineer, Mr. Bressler says:
So, what I'm going to do in this video is I'm going to show you how to do this.

Fukushima (left) working on the project.
I'm working on the work of a third-year-old from Japan City of Japan who's been working on the project on the tourist attractions and traditions of the Katsuya region, such as the Igata festival and the Katsuya Bridge.
Until the 5th of November, he is raising the cost of production at crowdfunding, and after he has finished, he is considering distributing it to local kindergartens and rehabilitation facilities free of charge.
What we're working on is Fukushima-sama-san (8), Nakamura-san (8), Miyagi-san (7), Kondo-san (7), and Moto-san (7).
They've been working on it since February.
Photos used for paint tags are taken locally, and collected from city officials.
It's close to completed, with the history and the description behind it.
Fukushima has told the students that they especially want to enjoy it, and others have been excited by the hope that it might lead to a new community's discovery.
The goal for crowdfunding was 300,000 yen and will be paid back in full if it did not reach its deadline.
We'll look for more details in the "Educated" section.
High School High School High School entrance examinations, end of the petition's gender section - Yahoo!
On September 26, 2019, the Japan Board of Education released a selection of senior high school students on September 26, 2019.
Care for trans-humans who do not match their mind and body, and eliminate gender areas from the form of the application.
Selection
The selection of enrolled students in the High School has compiled a collection of material, such as pre-preferences, requests, requests, requests, changes, examinations, examinations, passing and reference material.
It includes the selection of students, the selection of candidates, and the selection of students to attend high-school high-school high school, and the selection of students to volunteer from outside the country.
Until the year 2019, the application had a gender category, but the need for proper attention for individual sexual orientation and a wide variety of gender-responsibility diversity was seen as a way to cut the gender of the application from the style of the application.
In the final analysis, it's the five courses in language, mathematics, society, science, and English.
The English hearing test is part of the English test time.
We've got 50 minutes to test each subject.
The answer is 45 minutes each, and five minutes is required to distribute such items as the paper.
I'm going to give you a couple of examples.
In 2020, the number of applicants who entered the North Sea High School was announced as the second candidate, from March 23 to April 24, 2020, at 4 p.m., January 29 to 4 p.m., when the request was passed, at 4 p.m., March 4, and when the second candidate was passed, at 10:00 p.m., March 17th, at 4:24 p.m., the second candidate was announced.
The recommendation and co-optim selection will take place from January 21st to noon, February 13, 2020, and the interview will be held on February 13, and those who have not received the request will be re-communicated from February 20 until noon on February 21st to 26th.
Boris Johnson alerts the British to a riot like Los Angeles when Bregggit is covered.
Last night, a senior minister said that if the second vote was over the outcome, there would be a danger of a "threatening national violence" in the country.
The Prime Minister's officials warned that Britain would face a yellow vest movement in France for economic inequality and a massive civil uprising in Los Angeles in 992.
Johnson said "we need to calm down the anger" for political arguments, but he insisted that we not stop using the word "lost".
Despite the Prime Minister’s appeal for calm, one cabinet minister told The Times: “In this country, there has never been anything like the Jere Jone (Year Best Movement) or the Los Angeles riots of 992.
People don't think there will be riots in this country just because it has never happened before.
We already have a sample of the Yellow Best Movement, they're encrypted their mobile phones and there are several populist leaders who use dirty hands to encourage people.
In Los Angeles, there was a riot after a jury had convicted four white police officers who beat King in 992.
As of this year, French protesters in yellow vests have been causing chaos and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
He pointed to Johnson's warning in the House, saying that if the United Kingdom failed to leave the EU, our political system would be destroyed.
"If 30 million people vote for the vote and 66% vote for the EU, millions are unhappy," he says.
Even if 99 percent of the voters oppose the departure, the 0 million people who are very angry will not give up writing letters to the House of Representatives.
It won't be long before tens of thousands of people go into the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second vote were to reverse the outcome of the first election, there would be a danger of a "stirring national violence" in the country.
Johnson wants to have a general election and leave Bregggit's decision to the voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing a rebellion in the House of Representatives calling for a compromise to lower his demands for the departure of the EU.

The new Labyrinth Albex BBs of Pro basketball have prayed for victory on the 27th of the week, which has been over the B League.
The players and staff of the Arbitrex BB made a prayer for victory in Miyagi, Shinjuku City, 27 A.D.
Last season, Shinjuku won its first district in the history of clubs.
But after the end of the season, the score King, Davente Gardner, joined the other team in the B league.
This year, we're celebrating a new foreign national player, Nick Perkins, to achieve more performance than last season's district champions.
"It's important to increase the speed of the team coach and the strength of the DW fence beyond the last season so that he can excel in the mid-time district win."
The beginning of the New Labyrinth is on the 5th of October, against the Tokyo Arbark.
He's the brother of a well-known Pakistani social media man who was sentenced to life in a life sentence for "honor killing."
Women’s rights experts say that the process often takes longer to execute time, while the accused murderer is released, and his memory diminishes.
Farzana Bari, a female rights activist and founder of Pakistan's first University of Gender Studies, said that it took more than three years to resolve even the famous Baloch case.
Human rights groups say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but Pakistan's Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "honor killings" in '08.
Many human rights advocates say that there are more honor killings than there are, but it is because they estimate that Pakistan accounts for about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings committed every year by honored violence watchers around the world.
"Pacorella Action." 300 million yen.
It was reported by the Council's Committee on Human Rights on the 26th of the 26th day that the province will add “360 million dollars” to the September budgets, including JR Numazu Station and the necessary decision-making costs.
It's proposed to the county council on the 27th.
This will give the general accounting for the September budget bill 8.8 million dollars.
After the outbreak of a new pig colla in Japan and other places, it will add to the toxicity point of the cattle truck that is currently located in the western city of Lakesang, as well as three areas in the area near the Kanto area.
A related cost of $77.4 million.
In addition, to prevent the spread of the disease from the main route of the wild wild wild wilds, we will also take the wild ones outside the western part of the country to make sure that they are not infected with the pig cholera.
In the eastern and central provinces, "the cost of catching 560 animals and testing them is .58.6 million yen.
The decision process, based on the construction of Numazu Station, adds the expense and operating costs of the project's assessment of the site.
According to the Department of State's Accounting Committee, the application for the decision for the release of the uncontaminated land on the 8th day of the district and Numazu was accepted on 9th.
From now on, on the 3rd and 7th of November, the application will be expanded at Numazu City, and the decision will begin immediately after the decision is made.

India, flooding and chaos caused by long-term monsoons
In India, Monsoon season has lasted for about a month, and unprecedented rainfall has caused the collapse of buildings and deaths, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Usually, Monsoons in northern India weaken their strength at the beginning of September, while the average rain of this month increases by 37 percent.
According to experts from the Indian Weather Agency, if the situation continues for several days, the monsoon will weaken at the latest in the last few decades.
In many parts of India, the rain has still been unprecedented, and in Pune, western India, the latest reports show that several buildings were destroyed by heavy rain on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and several people were killed in the disaster.
The houses were flooded, and the people walked through the streets with their heads covered with water, becoming a sight that is usually only seen during the heyday of Monsoon.
There has been heavy rain in other cities, such as Cortaka, Rakna, Hyderabad.
In the northern state of Uttalacand, the heavy rain has caused heavy damage to the house.
The monsoon came too late.
Water shortages in many areas, and farmers prepared for drought.
The longer monsoons are not good for farmers.
This rainfall is not normal at this time.
Plarakash Mehre, a small farmer in Vimtar, Uttacand, said: "Now we make cabbage, beans, peas, and tomatoes, but the rain rots the vegetables."
For consumers, the price of onions that are not for Indian cooking will increase slowly because of the uninhibited monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 Rupees per kilo (23 pence) are usually sold for 80 rup.
The festival is in danger.
The next big festival is Dashera, on October 8, where Hindus install the Lavana, the figure of a huge comic book-style doll, the epic .
burning Lavana means that good is destroyed.
But since the doll is made of paper, if Monsoon is long, the last thing you can laugh at is Lavana.

It's not like we're going to be exposed to a lot of pesticides.
The latest study shows that working around high concentrations increases the risk of heart disease later on.
This is the result of more than 30 years of tracking the loops of Japanese-Americans living in Hawaii.
Researchers have found that men who have been exposed to large amounts of pesticides have a 45 percent higher risk of heart disease and heart disease than men who did not work around the pesticides.
"The study highlights the importance of wearing personal protection when exposed to pesticides on the job, writing in medical records where the chemicals are exposed on the job, and reducing the risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatriz Rodríguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodríguez is a professor of medical science at the University of Hawaii in Manoah.
This is the result of a study taken from more than 6,000 men on Oahu Island who participated in the Kuikini Honolulu Heart Program.
The study, researchers say, may not be applied to women and other races, since it's limited to men of Japanese descent.
Pharmaceuticals have a long half-life, and the health effects may come after years of exposure.
The study showed the greatest impact in the year following exposure.
“As a result of 34 years of tracking, the relationship between exposure of pesticides at work and heart disease and heart disease is no longer important,” Dr. Rodrigues said in a press release.
This is probably because other factors related to aging become more important and conceal the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in later years.
Researchers have found that there is no significant connection between exposure to low-intensity pesticides and heart disease and heart attacks.
Intervention of polochenko at a zerlensky lamp call
The Washington political issue was a very unusual week.
I wanted to avoid political scandals for political newcomer Volzimir Selensky.
But what has been learned about the Serensky lamp phone issue and how does Selensky have a wide range of impacts?
At the beginning of the telephone meeting, Trump told Selensky that the United States is doing more for Ukraine than any other European country.
Although the phone records published by the White House are not explicit, Trump pointed out that Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders are more concerned with talking to each other than with specific proposals:
Serensky's response to 100 percent of the cards was controversial:
Selensky added that the president and Merkel both do not fully support Ukraine.
This conversation inspired politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties, to argue on social media.
Ukraine's former president, Peter Polochenko, posted on Twitter that "the support received from the EU is unprecedented".
In addition, Polochenko tweeted that he was grateful for the support of Russian sanctions and economic aid in the EU during the Russian invasion.
Ukrainian politician Victoria Voitiska expressed concern that she could negotiate again with Germany and France.
Trump continues by asking Selensky for military help, not for 'em, but for 'two', and the second for Joe Biden's son hunter, which suggests that Ukrainians were involved in the democratic E-mail breach during the 2016 election and is investigating the server of the hacked Democratic National Commission.
Is this an obstacle to European relations, a standoff against the French and the German leaders, or an opacity?
I don't want to say anything about anyone.
"Thank those who support us for the fact that the phone records have been released," Serensky said at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Selensky will meet with the heads of Russia, Germany, and France at the four summits scheduled for October.
Ghana, Two Prized for International Civil Airways.
Ghana won two honorable awards at the 40th International Civil Air Service (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
This award was granted by the Air Safety Director to have reached the highest mark in Africa, after Ghana gained 89.89% in a short period of time.
Earlier, the ICAO, according to the World Safety Oversight Report of the United Nations Airways, had completed an adjustment investigation operation (ICVM) on April 3, 2019.
The award for safety is due to the recognition that Ghana adheres to the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO regarding safety in airports and airspaces.
These awards were created as part of ICAO's slow zero campaign support.
In addition, safety assessments show that "6 certificates, security assessments" were given to the ICAO countries whose security standards have improved.
The award was received by Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister for Ghana, Simon Aroti, Secretary of Civilization in Ghana, Ambassador to Canada in Nii Ikoi Otou, and director of Yau Kuwawa, Ghana's Air Port Company.
In his speech, the chairman of the Director General of the International Civil Air Service, Olmwa Bernard Aliu, stressed the need to maintain air safety in the country:
He said, "It is important to keep in mind that air safety, security and survival are still the most fundamental priorities in this age of innovation."
Ada also said that the award is a combination of the enduring efforts and endurance of the sector, a source of Ghana's effort.
He further pointed out that “aerospace is more likely to dramatically change our lives” and that the airline industry has a huge potential for developing its own economy.
It has social benefits, but all of them have the security and security that we have achieved.

The four strong are moving towards Okaoka, Osama, Miyagi, Miyagi, and the center of the mountain.
The first match is from the East Coast.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
I won 18 at the finals, and I won without incident.
There's nothing wrong with the security.
The East Sea is on the verge of a one-time battle in the region of Taita, which is trying to win the three divisions.
Many of the members of Japan's major national championships in the summer of the Ace field remain.
This summer, the most experienced king of the East Sea dares.
The second game is in the middle of the sun.
In a three-time match, you mark more than ten hits, and the strength of not missing the scorer is strong.
We've lost two points in all three games, centered on a high-powered history.
At the center of the mountain, the left arm, Tetsuta Tetsuta, played two games, and showed the power to get through at the main point.
The line is open to two rambles in the black war, and it's hard to get them tied up.
They're gonna be watching each other's confrontations.
The finals and the third finals will be held on the 29th, and the top three will have the right to attend the Tokyo Games held in Iwaki province in October.

Mr. Cards, Peter Gino has been appointed Chief of the FEMA.
President of the United States of America's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Peter Gino smiled at the 20-year FEMA budget hearing in Capitol Hill, Washington, U.S.A. on April 3, 2019.
Washington - the president of the United States, Donald Trump, has appointed Peter Gino to the U.S. Department of Emergency Management on Thursday.
Gino, the deputy director of FEMA, was in charge of directing the government's response to disasters such as hurricanes and fires.
The agency has been absent from the office since former Secretary of State, Brock Long, who has been approved by the Senate since March.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the FEMA's top organization, ruled that Long was using the government's public vehicle to travel between Washington and his home, Norvalina, and accepted it and resigned.
Jeffie Byad, another recommended, had been removed from the poll earlier this month when she was suspected of getting drunk and involved in a riot.
Mr. Gino's appointment was exactly what I expected.
From now on, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Before he became the vice president of FEMA in 2018, Gino was working for the Emergency Management Department in Rhode Island, and had a Navy soldier, says the White House.
CBS Los Angeles - police shut down illegal marijuana Bayping operations in San Gabriel Valley
Elmonte (CBSLA) - Police closed the illegal marijuana baking operation in San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
At 4:37 p.m., after the police had issued a search warrant suspected of selling illegal marijuana p.m., a large container of bhutanney oil was found in an office building at 9600 blocks Telster Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of Elmonte Police said that the investigator also found equipment to pack Beep Cartr..
"This process is very dangerous," said Lieutenant Cano.
Lieutenant Cano had been involved in a drug investigation before and said that the extraction of oil used in Beep products could lead to arson.
"It's possible that the static electricity from the clothes can be fired, and it's concentrated, so it's not only a fire but it can trigger an explosion."
More than that, if there were more than one canister like this, the whole building could be blown away, not only by explosions and fires.
Dangerous waste disposal squads were called into an empty office and confiscated an illegal and dangerous substance.
The cost of confiscated goods and equipment was not soon released.
An anonymous tip led to a search warrant on the scene where it discovered illegal activity, said the investigator.
Investigators are still in pursuit of who's behind the illegal Beep operation.
The police said the office was empty, and they believe that he set up a store in the office.
As the investigation went on, the police said they wanted to keep the illegal Bayping products out of the way, especially in recent news that concerns the risk of Bayping.
He said, "It's what you buy without even knowing if it's real."
Products can be mixed with other toxic substances.
It may harm our community and our children, and the police are always warning people not to go near these activities.
During the concert, there was a massive earthquake of six magnitude!
Evacuation training at the hall of Miyazaki City. - Yahoo! News!
In the halls of Miyazaki City, a practical evacuation training was performed, assuming that an earthquake occurred during the concert.

Elizabeth, the lost dress of the world, exhibits at thehampton Court Palace.
It was made of the finest camlett silk, made of silver thread, and covered with vegetation, beasts, and gorgeous stings of butterflies.
Histrick Royal Palace's dress collection anchor, Elli Lin, is determined to be one.
Lin saw this piece of cloth lying on the wall of a small rural church, placed there 100 years ago, and appears to be part of the garment that has been missing from Elizabeth's life's dress dance.
Three years after Lin stumbled upon this magnificent cloth that was used as the altar of the church in Baxter, Helena, Elizabeth's lost dress will be displayed next month at thehampton Court Palace near the room, which the Tudoran Queen might have worn more than 450 years ago.
"The only remaining sixth-century dress is another one, and it turns out it was an important discovery of the entire royal dress collection.
While there is no complete proof that Elizabeth was wearing her sleeves, three years of research have convinced experts that the dress will belong to the royal family.
The "silver thread" of exquisitely expensive fabrics was made available only to senior members of the royal family, but it also suggests that the“silver” plants and flowers were later added to the deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen, bears, and other animals had a noble hold on them.
The dress was probably the equivalent of one Tudor house at the time it was built.
It is also estimated that in the late 1590s, at the end of Elizabeth's day, the queen was often threatened by other women in the palace, or that her rivals wearing such luxury clothing were impatient.
She said that it's important to make public.
I'm always so happy to see the cloth and I'm sure I'm watching one of the royal dresses."
A long piece of Second Life, which was used as the altar for the Church of St. Faces, which was cut off and invisible in Bakuton, seems unexpected, but not so much.
Bakuton is a village from Blanche Parry, who served as a maid throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and local legends say that the cloth has long been associated with parley.
Although the dress is after his death in 1590, experts believe it must have taken place as a memorial to his family or church before Elizabeth died in 1603.
The altar, which has been used for more than 1,000 hours to repair and 400 hours of special use of silk and fine surgical needles, will be displayed next to the rainbow portrait of Elizabeth, one of the most celebrated modern paintings rented from the Hutfield House during the exhibition.
The only space available to store a portion of the priceless tapestry is the renovated greenhouses in the Hampton Courtyard, where most of the work is done and the work is done, says Libby Thompson, who taught him: “When dealing with historical fabrics, I really feel respect for the crafts of the people who made it.”
When you look at the daggers on the front and back, you see a tremendous respect for the person who made them.
I've never seen anything so sophisticated.
Elizabeth's lost dress show will be held on October 12.
"I've searched for a girl who's been missing from my job, "The week Self-Survivors are gone, and volunteer men are missing."
"It's been a week since a girl in grade school went missing."
No sign of it yet. The Self-Sguard has completed their search on 28 days.
"The week after 28 days, the search began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people, including police and self-guard forces.
The village, however, asked the Self-Sguard to evacuate the area "for which they asked to be searched," and the search for the Self-Survivors ended at noon.
The Self-Defense Force has sent 650 people to a high-risk location from 25 to 4 days.
Also, on 27 days, 20-year-old men who volunteered to search lost track of the search, and they were not found.
Police and fire departments will continue their search from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 a.m.
One vote of inequality suit, first speech argument, MRTakisaki broadcast. - Yahoo! News!
The first speech of the trial, which the voters wanted to cancel, was held at the Fukuoka High Court's Office and was immediately presented.
According to the law, the plaintiffs are calling for the election to be disabled, saying that the vote value is 0.71 in Miyagi province and only 0.48 in Kagoshima, compared with the country's lowest state of Fukushima in July of this year.
In the first speech on the 27th of the 27th day at Fukuoka Takazaki's office, the plaintiffs claimed that the value of each vote was unequal and constitutional.
In response to this, the district election board of the defendants called for the dismissal as "not a significant inequality in the matter of constitutionality, but a constitutional right".
The verdict will be passed on October 30.

A big truck, Giga, to the world's first brand-new model...
In Tokyo's 2019 Tokyo Motors Show, which will be held on October 24 through November 4, the world's latest model of the "giga" truck will be released for the first time.
In addition to advanced fail-safes, Giga's model of the truck's flagship model, expand the wear-out gear for drivers.
It contributes to safe driving by means of pre-clash brakes that detect pedestrians and bikes, blind spots monitors that help prevent accidents in the left turn and change lanes, and variable LED head lamps.
It also contributes to the tiredness of drivers by means of a full-speed mass-wave cruise and a new Heilifkab, which follow the front vehicles at full speed.
In addition, MIMAMoORI has expanded the control of vehicles.
We'll also monitor the safety of the fail-safe and assist in the safety of the system.
We're also going to use the "FL-IR" as a show model.
FL-IR has noted the similarities between the ultrasonic conversations and behaviors found in fish and the connectomes and the train tracks.

We've arrived at the space station. We've got a robot arm. Ates, the newspaper.
We've arrived at the International Space Station.
The station's robot arm is growing from the bottom left (used by NASA).
The International Space Station succeeded in catching the 8th plane, applauding JAXA officials = 28 days (off with JAXA)
The "Aerospace Research and Development Organization" (JAXA) that carries supplies to the 400-mile international space station has arrived near the station on the 28th night, and the remaining astronauts have operated and picked up the robot arm.
The supply plane was launched on 25 days from the Ginshima Space Center in Kagoshima, Japan, and has gradually gained control of the JAXAO wave center.
Finally, by flying at the same speed as the station, we lose the speed difference and get closer to "about 0 meters."
It's a seven-and-a-half-foot robot arm that grabs the supply.
We've got about 5-3 tons of supplies on board.
After they're put on the station, the pilot is going to pack up.
Mexican drug cartel chief, involved in a third of the US's internal drugs.
From Chicago, just after sunrise on Chicago West Side, CBS News caught a rush hour for the drug trade.
Brian Macnight of the DEA (DEA) revealed what's going on in broad daylight.
In Chicago nearly 800 people died of overdose last year.
Macnight said that probably 90 percent of the drugs traded in Chicago came from Mexico.
The DEA's focus is on the Mexican drug king, known as El Mencho, Nemécio Selvantes.
"Socho is the DEA and, in fact, the top target of the U.S. federal law enforcement agency."
The bounty on El Mencho reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahie, dozens of drug-making centers of El Mencho in the jungle have been uncovered.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisko Nueva, CJG, is involved in at least three-thirds of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, the cartel has been selling cocaine, methamphetamines, and phthalate heroin.
El Mencho's head is worth $10 million.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago but was arrested for drug trafficking and sent back to Mexico.
So I started a violent drug cartel.
He owns a huge amount of weapons, loaded rockets, and a .50-caliber.
He said he actually owns his own special task force.
El Mencho, from the bombing of the Mexican Army helicopter that killed six people, to his involvement in the public execution of this summer, is without punishment defending his empire.
In recent years, thousands of murders have been committed by drug cartels.
According to the government's statistics, there are about 94 murders a day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic, so you have to wear a protective suit when handling it.
In the manufacturing center, cocaine bags are marked by smugglers.
Over three-thirds of it is thought to be El Mencho's drug cartel.
Donahie said, "Mencho is involved in the influx of harmful substances that virtually take innocent women and children's lives."
"It's more likely that someone's child is a drug brought to him by El Mencho's organization when he's dead."
Over 77,000 Americans died from an overdose last year.
He's been sent to England for the first time in ten years.

Children booking at the Koala Arc party on 28th, Osaka City's Royal Temple Zoo
On the 28th of the day, the Royal Temple Zoo held a reception of the only male Koala Arc in Osaka.
In the middle of September, there's a zero-year loan to the British zoo and it's very likely they won't come back.
Thank you.
About 600 visitors gathered in front of the Coorra, where the eucalyptus thrives, missed their farewells.
Arc is two years old.
The koala's life expectancy is expected to last 5 or 20 years in England, where he has been married.

Sonny, play station 4 surprise news.
Sonny revealed the contents of the scheduled PS4 set of Ass Part 2.
As part of a recent State of Prey release, Sony released the February 2020 release of the series "The Last of Ass".
Some of the exciting video of the new action game was also presented by fans.
More details were published a few days after the big news of Last of Ass2.
Sonny and Notidog are back to the old days in many ways.
The Last of Ass Part 2 is released on multiple disks I haven't seen since PS1.
In an excellent interview with the Telegraph, Notidog Neil Drrackman announced that the series had evolved into one of the biggest games of all time:
"In a different way, the story is massive and complex," Drrackman said.
So, let's think about this.
I didn't mean to make the biggest game in history.
“There is a moment when users are excited about how this story will unfold, but they realize it’s actually the beginning and the beginning of all other sections.”
The game didn't fit into a big, single blue line, and it was two disks.
In addition, Last of Ass Part 2 says that if you open it in your office, it's a bad Easter egg.
I don't want to ruin this surprise, but the Easter egg in the game has a connection to the old Noti Dog.
When Last of Ass Part 2 is released on February 21, 2020, you will find out more.
If you have PS4, you can pick up the Last of As Mastered with the PS+ and prepare for the release of the series.
In October 2019, Sonny recently released a play station plus a free PS4 game, including the above - Noti Dog.
MLBs Shaw 19 will also be released for members of the PS Plus team in November.
Sonny has already released several versions of the game, including the privileged version of her popular character backpack and bracelet, which includes a 12-inch figure.
The council has tried, the residents hope to continue.
As the age of the population grew, travel began to begin on the 26th day of Chijima Island, an island of low sales.
"In a trial up to February, a van loaded with items, flavors, and food, the first day passed through the town and the town council.
Some of the products were quickly replaced by more than expected sales, and residents were told that choosing items would be fun.
The wagons were loaded with zeros, including total vegetables, city garbage bags and detergents.
A small piece of potato salad in a pack, and a total vegetable like a snooze, stood at a price of $00.00.
In the town hall, there was a row of people who sold out salts and sugars.
"I didn't think it would sell so well."
Nakajima Nakata Nakashima, who usually shops on her husband's car, hoped that his father would not know how long he could drive, and he would continue to do so.
Users also ordered, "I don't want canned coffee, I want coffee to be mined."
The council will consider the desired items.
Today, only a convenience store is available on Chijima, and the council has tried to move to save the “shops”.
"I'll go to 20 towns on the island on the moon until February to see if I can continue as a business next year.
The Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, announced that he has decided to add about 100 million dollars to the drought victims.
The cash policy for drought-stricken farmers will be extended, and existing farmers' allowances will be greatly reduced due to simplifying.
In addition, about $34 million will be spent on drought aid, and farmers will receive $3 million in emergency aid.
As a drought disaster aid program, up to 13 municipalities will be helped with drought relief, which will limit 100 million dollars in infrastructure and drought control.
In addition to this addition, the government has already covered over 7 billion budgets in support of droughts.
Ronald Lee Haskell: The murder of his ex-wife's family in Texas.
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted of killing Steve, Katie Stat and four of his five children in Spring, Texas, in 2014.
The authorities said that he broke into Stains' home on July 9, 2014 and questioned the whereabouts of his ex-wife, Melanie Haskell.
Melanie was away, but she had a family with her sister Katie Stay.
The Harris County Police Department announced that the shooting took place: Stephen Stall, Katie Stay, 13 and 4-year-old son, 9 and 7-year-old daughter.
Only one member of the family, Kashidi Stall, who was 15 years old at the time, survived.
In those days, authorities reported that Kasdi was seriously injured, but she recovered completely.
Thursday, all the jurys in agreement rejected the conviction of the death of Ronald Lee Haskell.
The jury's been removed until Monday's amount.

The global warming is getting more serious.
At the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, Swedish "6-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg spoke out for reinforcements:
It's been used as a spark to spread the school strike around the world, like boycotting the class and sitting in front of the parliament.
The growing anxiety and anxiety among young people has led to a uniform protest throughout the world, including Japan.
"It is estimated that there are about four million participants in over 50 countries.
He also marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Convention, which launched in 2020, will effectively zero the world’s greenhouse gas emissions in the latter half of this century, and "if we can reduce the rise of temperatures before the industrial revolution by less than two degrees", the goal is to reduce the temperature level.
We are going to take steps that will be taken by all the developed countries and all the developing countries without distinction.
But there are extreme weather events that are pointed to in relation to global warming, such as hot and heavy rain.
It requires a step-by-step effort to keep the climate warm at a rapid rate.
At a summit called by United Nations Secretary-Presidents to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries will face a long-term goal that will be virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries tried to raise their goal.
Meanwhile, China and India, besides the United States leaving the Paris Convention, have failed to reveal their new goals and have created a sharp decline in emissions.
Aggressive criticism of Japan's coal-fired power.
Government long-term strategy puts as early as possible emissions in the latter half of this century, but the distance between countries headed for "50 years" is large.
Japan didn't have the chance to speak at the summit.
At a conference on climate change, the director of the environment, Shinji Kochi, described the initiative in Japan at an environmental conference, saying: "We should be happy, cool, and sexy."
I don't deny the appeal, but I'm too poor for the appeal of the girls.
No reaction to the now symbolic presence of the environmental movement.
A slander that doesn't argue can only be "reverseing the point" that he disagrees with.
No longer will there be any delay in the warming process, and the international community will have to work together for the common crisis of humanity.
We can't hope to be as effective as any of the initiatives we're working on.
There are a lot of young people and children behind her.
We need to act so that we don't lose that future.
I'm going to show you how to do this.
The study of the United States Army has brought the quantum Internet closer to reality.
The Internet might be able to provide military security, measurements and timing, which was not possible in its approach to traditional networks.
According to the Center for Dispersal Quantum Information, which is funded and run by the U.S. Army Institute for War Fight Forces, researchers at Insbruck have completed a record of quantum entrants traveling between matter and light -- 50 kilometers from the light fiber optic cable.
And that's what we're talking about.
So, if two quantum bits are in the Entangrating state and measured on one side, even if the other one is far away physically, then the result of the measurement will be affected by the other.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits bigger than it had ever been before, and is realistic enough to start building an intercity quantum network," says Dr. Ben Lanoon, the first experimental physicist at Insbruck University, who published his results in the field of quantum information.
It's called the inter-city quantum network.
This dispersion is absolutely essential to the creation of the quantum Internet, according to researchers.
"This proof is a big step forward to the realization of a massive dispersal-industrial envelope," says Dr. Sarah Gamble, vice president of the army program that supports the study.
It also maintains enough quality to meet the requirements of some of the most difficult quantum networks in the exit through the fiber.
The team started experimenting with the calcium atom caught in the ion trap.
The researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions and encourage them to release a beam of information stored in the quantum field.
So, this is what happens when we look at the Sun and the Sun.
It's called the Eyeglass. It's called the Eyeglass.
"The wavelength of the photon from the calcium ions is 854 nanometers, which is quickly absorbed by the fiber optic cable."
So, the first thing we did was we sent the light particles through nonlinear crystals with strong lasers.
And so, this is what we're going to do.
This light beam was then sent through a light fiber cable 50 kilometers long.
So, in the case of the universe, we can see that the universe is in the same state as it is in the same state as the universe.
The reason why we're using the calcium atom is because the calcium is able to capture the high quality of the clock with the quantum bit, so the results of this experiment will be a reality of an enveloped network in the long atomic clock.
The big Entangling Clock Network is a very important field for the army from the perspective of precise position measurements, navigation and timing applications.
