I've seen a thousand birds in Netflix yesterday, but I've seen a lot of people laughing behind my back when I'm saying something that's not particularly funny.
It's obviously not funny, but it's not funny to say "I laugh at everything you're selling."
But if you don't smile, the geisha will be in a bad mood.
It's like the old black company, and some of the geisha' egos seem to be so bad-looking that you can't eat it.
On the other hand, it's a lot to discuss "Don't lick the geisha" every time they feel the pain of their job.
I know it's very low till I can sell it, but I'm always told that I'm standing at the top of my profession.
I only hear the justification for the beauty and laughter of my careers because the people in the media and society are too high.
To be honest, some of the industries that I work in are pretty hard, but I feel like they're getting harder and harder to touch.

He changed the product he ordered at the Takmonet shop on his own.
Summary: When I ordered a loose radio mouse, the mouse's hard-wired version arrived, and I was told to send it back if I wanted a return.
It's not like you're talking about your own computer, but it's not like you're talking about your own computer.
It was discovered that the MSI wireless mouse was selling for 3,280 yen at a Takmonet store's daily sale the previous Friday.
So I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to the store and I'm going to go to the store it.

So let's see if we can figure out how to do that.
One, refuse to accept and cancel.
2. Only return mouse and return money
3. Use line mouse as it is
Choose what to do with it.
It seems that the product page is divided between the cable and the radio, and it's written on the purchase history, e-mails, and mails, but it's written on the radio instead of the lined version.

It was Japan's 9-year-old typhoon that had a profound impact on the lives of the eight families.
"It's like, "I'm serious."
"It seems as if the only road to the Highland has been washed away by a typhoon in Japan and 30 families have been isolated."
The people who were forced to cross the water continued to carry supplies with them using JR bridges that were not normally accessible.
Matsumoto-san: "When you get down to the garden, you walk down the bridge with your hand in your hand or with your back on the bridge, and you feel the bad taste of traffic and the car." "The emergency bridge completed within three months was washed away by heavy rains and was again isolated for a few days until the temporary bridge hit."
After more than two years after the disaster, Miyamoto continues to take a lesson.
I think there's about zero cases.
In the meantime, I'd like to make sure that we have two or three days of food that can be used for emergency meals, such as cans, bowls, and other foods that can be prepared about three times as much as before the disaster.
Yamamoto-san: "I don't know when a disaster will happen to me, so I thought maybe I should do some stockings and all of you."
To forget the lesson, we started our own town since 202.

Be careful when buying used housing!
- Yahoo! News!
● A new building development to activate the used housing market has been successful in the traditional housing trade.
The cost of building houses, apartment buildings, and re-form markets are increasing.
It's likely to be influenced by the rising demand for housing, the rising demand for housing, the rising demand for new property in terms of the word "in front of the station, near the station, and "big" and "towers" and the relative loss of new property.
However, the existing housing distribution in Japan is still low compared to overseas.
So, in 2018, the Ministry of Homeland Traffic changed some of the property trading laws and started a survey of buildings to make sure that they were safe and safe and used houses, and started a search called Inspection (https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/com/0012199. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's a system where a well-informed architect checks the status and condition of the building, including the deterioration of the property, and puts it together in a report and presents it as a buyer.
With the introduction of Inspection, the Ministry of Justice explains that there are benefits for both buyers and sellers.
The sellers will be able to avoid the crem after handing him over to do real estate surveys before the sale and will reassure the buyers.
It's also connected to the discrimination of the competition.
On the other hand, the buyer also argues that it is a system that can determine the state of the old houses that are scheduled to be purchased and that it can be bought with good intentions.
But on the system of the system, it is mainly the sellers who take the lead in the search for buildings.
In addition, we want to be aware that the mere announcement of the system of inflation has become mandatory.
So the real estate agent in charge of the interagency is obliged to say, "I can't do that," or, "I can't do that."
● While the risk of consumer-led inflation is at stake, a similar system has already been established in the United States and the United Kingdom, where the used market is active.
In the early stages of housing trafficking, buyers are asking professionals called "Insectors" and "building surfers" to investigate buildings.
In the United States, for example, inflation is practiced at between 70 and 90 percent of the traditional housing trade in the state.
The fact that "buyers" are leading the inflation is quite different in nature and nature of the "seller" main.
The sellers will show you a little bit of the condition of the building and try to sell it as high as possible.
The buyer, on the other hand, takes a closer look at the survey and thinks he wants to live in a safe place by making proper repairs.
Even the same instigation, both purposes and thoughts have developed.
The Japanese system is therefore pointed out as a disturbing risk:
● The country's main seller-led Inspection study has been kept to a minimum.
It's not a detailed investigation, so it's a risk of missing a really important failure.
So there's a possibility that there's an insecurities going on that don't report the results against the seller.

Ginza was an island?
- Yoo! News!
"This was a long time ago.
"If it's Ginza who can give you a little lesson."
I'm going to show you a little bit of the knowledge of the bean in Ginza that I'd like to tell you about.
Over Ginza?
I've never been in Ginza before.
As we walk through Ginza, we find a shadow of history carved out of the lands of Ginza, the names of strange places, the mysterious stelas, and many shrines.
I was walking with her in Ginza, and in the silence that I had never heard, "This was an old half-earth.
Ginza used to be a half Island?
A downtown pronoun that created "Silence" throughout Japan, "Ginza" in central Tokyo.
In the first place, Ginza was a silver mine.
At the time, they called it the New City, but when I moved to Ishin, it came to be called Ginza.
By the way, it used to be "the Peninsula" that ran into the sea near Ginza.
Before the Edo period, the estuary came in from Siyagi to Ginza, and the island of Edo, from the Japanese bridge to Ginza, was extended.
The tip of that peninsula is now in Ginza.
The Manjidani has opened a banner in the Edo and buried the bays and proceeded to organize the Kyobashi district.
In addition, the house has established a section of the city, and has put a moat in order to develop boat travel.
He cut down the soil and the Mount of Morita and buried the coves.
There is a stela on the site of Ginza, which marks the site of the Ginza Hall, and you might want to look for an interesting point.
"The Pilgrimage of the Holy Land" of Ginza, no one knows.
In Ginza, there is an annual pilgrimage to the Holy Land, known to everyone who knows it.
Of the more than ten shrines, the most visible is the "Song of the Sapporo" in front of the Sapporo.
Many of the companies on the right side of the Sapporo are not present before or after the theater.
On the other hand, the dragon's unobstructed honor is on the roof of a silver pine house, and the silver throne is located on the nineth floor of the silver throne.
"The House of Treasures" and "The Deerty of Abyssai" are hidden in the alleys and in the streets.
The shrine also includes the Inevitable King and the Land of the Land, but most of the shrines make rice their god.
The rice mill where the fox welcomes them in front of the House has been built on the ground for the good of the corn fertility which is so common in farmers.
It turned out that big cities like Kyoto and Edo had a good business, and the faith has spread in downtown and Ginza, Japan's best city.

A different treatment depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
I've been suffering from knee pain lately.
What kind of disease could it be?
The cause of the pain in the knee is injury, arthritis, and a painful attack.
In Japanese, it's called the formative joint.
(Laughter)
Dr. Guangyama: Yes.
And so, this is what we're trying to do.
However, age, obesity, and extreme sports can reduce or distort the radius.
It's not a good idea. It's not a bad idea.
(Laughter)
Dr. Guangyama: Yes.
It's not just the knee. It's also possible for the elbow, the ankle, the neck, the thumb, or the hip.
The most common case of the knee, however, is what is called the deformative knee joint.
What's the structure of the joints in the first place?

3rd Gambling and Games in a Real Sound series that can actually be experienced - Yahoo! News
It's an explosively popular gambling cartoon series called "Kaiji" , centered on men.
One of the favorites of the book is the life-threatening limit game.
Just looking at it makes me feel like I'm trying to cross the steel!
I want to be able to actually play the game or test the game that I'm playing in the project video.
▪ The swamps of the trap-loaded panchromatoids in the "Gambling Caizi" .
The original film, at a high rate of $4,000 per square foot, surprised Kaiji.
This swamp was set up with a large trap for the nail forest, and the three-courons were considered almost impossible to attack.
But he used every move, and finally he went to the rough business of placing a plastic tank in a building and then sinking the ground.
The swamp that appeared in Kaizi actually appeared as a pacin, and a lot of people play it.
Of course, it's not like a four thousand yen, but it's also lowering the difficulty level.
▪ A rich man's "Starside Party" event in which he was put into effect by the debtors, including Kaiji, was the Iron Racer of Man.
The borrowers are busy trying not to fall over the thin steel skeletons that were installed on the ground 10 meters above the ground, racing to speed it up.
There are 12 participants who are able to win the prize, but only four steel bones, and no safety precautions, and they are quite likely to die.
In addition to the high risk of these steel crossings, which have been expanded as VR games, we can have the closest experience of the Eagle Bridge, which was set up at the Golden Eagle's Palace in the Natural Parks of Proball and North and North.
This Eagle Bridge has a steel bridge at a height of 20 meters (about 7 stories) and it has a skyblanco and a bridge with victory waiting for it to walk away.
Of course, safety measures are under way.
The funster's Colla minor storm released a video on his YouTube showing "Stone Sculptors Can Experience in Japan" and made a topic of discussion.
▪ E-card game for two players, E-card game.
One of the emperor's cards, eight of the citizens' cards, 10 of the slave cards, and 10 of them playing separately, on the side of the emperor, on the side of the slave.
The game is very well played, emperors are strong for citizens, citizens are strong for slaves, slaves are strong for emperors.
Kaiji will fight Kishikawa with the harsh rule that losing will cut his ear.
He realized that, in the end, the ear-damaging device, such as earphones, was reading the mind by detecting and sending pulses, temperature changes, and so forth, and he confused and won the river by cutting his ears to the limit and making the body abnormal.
So, let's say we have an E-card.
On YouTube, a popular YouTuber hikar posted a video of a game played by Motoji Kojio Kojima and E-card in a movie and started talking about it.
▪ Do you sometimes experience the feeling of kriji?
It's true that no one wants to be in such a situation, but when I read the cartoons, I feel only as good as I feel.
Let's see what we can see in the world through the game.
One step towards New Year's Eve, gently pushing the town's Occupyai.
The new year's preparation for the new state's shrine has appeared next year's estuary.
The students of the Tokyo Institute of Arts and Arts designed to visit the shrine on the 11th day, where the festival was held in front of God.
Since last year, the shrine has been asking a geisha artist to do his first painting.
In this case, a three-year-old piece of Kunihito's garment was adopted by the nine of the Arts and Japan Film courses, conducted by Professor Nagai Nagai.
So, let's take a look at this.
He said he painted the "image of cherry blossoms pushing their backs forward into the new year."
Stopping and looking at the cherry blossoms, the tiger is asked, "How can we afford to enjoy the beauty of nature in a world that is so changing?"
His designs are also depicted in popularly distributed drawing horses.
Chiba Chiba, 44, said, "I think it will help all people to overcome their difficulties."

In part of research and policy proposals for the Center for the Centre for the Intimate Support organization, I'd like to suggest to the mayors that young people live.
When are you having fun?
The facilitator's question is, "When you get excited with so many people, when you're beating the drum..."
First meeting held at the sunrise meeting on the third day of the month.
In a way called World Cafe, where "8 high school students and people in the community" talk about their theme as they move around the island, they think about the town of fun, the town of comfort, and the town of life.
I'm going to write them down.
It's fun to be in a town where there's a lot of young people who don't have trains, buses, and so on.
We're going to talk more and more about what's in common.
"I thought the field was boring, but I thought it was attractive to ride around the beach."
The three-year-old student (8) noticed not only local challenges but also charms when he spoke with adults, saying: "The shop is scarce, the traffic is difficult, but the natural abundance is good."
"The second time in February, only high school students met.
Next February, we're going to invite the mayors and the school presidents to announce.
The head of the center says, "When young people get involved in the process as well as growing up in high school country."

It's a huge disaster in the U.S. that's caused by an outlying heat and a strong cold.
Ten days of local time, from night to night, 11 days, and many tornadoes centered around the South of the United States.
It is estimated that during this period of time, the effects of the intense cold that hit the record temperature are extremely unstable in the atmosphere, and the cloud is rapidly developing.
It's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature of nine days of local time, and ten days of gold is rising to close to 30 degrees.
As these record warm spots descend below -500 meters above -30 ° F., they form active front lines, which quickly develop along the front lines.
We're looking at a couple of tornadoes around here.
South America is a region where tornadoes are naturally occurring, but the high season between early summer and summer does not cause much damage at this time.
The tornado warning reached nearly 150 times during the winter day, and was recorded in numerous numbers.
The U.S. National Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and tornadoes in just ten days of local time.
This shows that there are two areas of central focus, including the south line from Kentucky to Texas and the north line, including Illinois.
In Kentucky, it is believed that the EF scale of tornado strength reached the third highest EF3 from the strongest of the six stages, and that in a moment, a wind of 70 m/s fell.
So, we're going to look at this in the next video, and we're going to look at this in the future.
In Japan, JEF is used to match the conditions of Japanese architecture based on the improvement scale.
JEF3, the equivalent of this American tornado, is a lot more likely to occur in Japan, and a lot more likely to be destroyed by a wooden house.

"The largest" in the history of the U.S.
Concerning tornado damage in the midwestern and south of the United States, President Byden of the United States took a strange view of the 11th day, "one of the largest tornadoes in the history of the United States."
U.S. CNN TV reported.
"We do everything we can as a federal government," Mr. Byden stressed.
"I don't know how many lives were lost yet," he explained.
More than 100 people were killed.
A resident of Kentucky, affected by a tornado, carrying household items and other items from broken houses during the night from 10 to 11 days after the storm hit at least 30 tornadoes in Kentucky and elsewhere.
Weather experts in the U.S.C.C.N. have also calculated that this time it was about 250 miles (400 km) and the largest.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, a badly damaged candle factory was under construction 24 hours in preparation for the Christmas business.
At the time, 110 people were working, but the building was destroyed and no trace of it.
She felt the weight of a rescuer searching over the rubble, and asked for help from her Facebook live feed.
The live broadcast also heard the voices of the women calling for help, as well as the cries and the cries of other women who seemed to sing "Happy Birthday to You" to distract fear:
Amber Brown, a convenience store owner in Mayfield, was safe in the basement of his five-year-old son and his home because of a tornado alert.
"Many people think of the sound of the train, but it sounded like something was blowing out of the ground."
Mayfield P.D. police will continue their search until there is no need.

It's an old saying that there is a different view of the star system.
They argue that Japan will add or decrease three stars as neutral.
So, if you look at this example, you'll see that there are already two different stars at the point of reference.

So let's think about how we can do that.
And that's what we're talking about.
I don't think that's a good fit.
It's a global history boom.
The World History of Crops, Slaves, and Plagues is one of the many ways in which world history can be counted.
The "Hakobuune" book, "The Fish and the Sea- Old Tar sauce" by Hakobuune.
A luncheon of fish and shrimps and homemade tartar sauces.
A colorful luncheon and Deli's menu shop called "hakobuune" ..
"May the restaurant feel better at home," said Komichi-san (39) and his wife (38) who opened last August.
One of the popular menus for lunches is "The Fish and Squirrels of the Sea."
Fish choose the best of times in the market.
"Fry keeps flour as thin as possible so as to understand the texture of the material."
There are about four kinds of vegetables and diodes for lunches, and rice and soup for rice.
Vegetables are made in the fields by hand, and sold in the provincial district.
The side vegetables change at different times of the day, but Koji is practicing French, and Lape and Latatouyille add their colors.
On the other hand, they have a taste of familiar flavor, like a cylindrical egg, and a sumo that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations.
The food lunches are also popular with hamburgers.
From now on, we'll also release some wine and other meat processed for wine.

Look around you, look around you, look at you, look at you, look at you, it's good, it's good, but it's hard
It's not bad in general, but it still had a lot to do with improvement.
I'm sorry it's easier to use with less people or more attention.

A man was cut off and fled on a motorcycle on the 12th day of the attempted murder and accident in Saga.
About 1:25 a.m., on the first street of Saga, 40-year-old men in Fukuoka, Fukuoka, were cut off with a blade and wounded in the face.
The man fled on his bike, and the Saga Police Department is following him as a murder attempt.
According to the south police station, there was Number 110 that said "we're fighting" by passersby.
Males are said to be about six inches long, about one inch deep, but conscious.
The man who escaped is meat and skinhead.
There was a blade left that appears to have been used in the vicinity of the crime scene.
The men were drinking with a number of people they knew, looking for traffic problems between the pedestrians and the motorcycle men.

A long way for families to take root in the Chinese frontier (JBPress) - Yahoo! News
China, with its vast land, is also important in terms of biodiversity.
Some governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote the activities of environmental activists as well as the environment.
One of these is Shisapana, a region in the southern part of China.
She is now serving as an actress, Sisaphana is a border area between Laos and Myanmar, a region where many ethnic groups live, including the Thai people of Thailand and their roots.
The Mekong River flows through Southeast Asia.
The Seapana Thai people (Western Bibelforsis) have only about 0.2% of the territory in China, but about 25% of the wild animals and 20 percent of the plant species.
This time, Kunihito, an environmentalist in Sisapana, visited the area and told us about his activities.
▪ Beginning environmental activities with German husbands — for 20 years.
What was the motivation?
Zhang-san, our environmental effort has started since 2000.
My husband is Joseph Margraff.
My husband is from Germany, and he came to Seysapana for a joint science project with the United Nations and China.
This is China's only rain forest area, and it was one of the most diverse.
And that's what we're talking about.
Thus, massive deforestation of the rainforests has taken place before in order to establish industry in the region and to produce missing rubber in China.
He was sent here from Germany to study the recovery of natural resources and biological resources.
And then I got married, knowing me and the journalist here.
- Was he interested in conservation before that?
I was not interested in the importance of rain forest or the meaning of biodiversity.
So I decided to promote my project with my husband without that knowledge.
Sometimes I see people who aren't dressed, who aren't particularly tall.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
The aura is not something to come out of.
It's something that comes out of nature in a moment of self-confidence.
I'm sure he's very confident inside.

It doesn't cost you anything, so I suggest you open the NISA account at the same time so you can use it when you want it.

It took about a month and a half to start causing CTD in the MOD environment.
There are multiple factors that have taken place while stable data has not had much time to play since March, and it's been very consistent to do a little bit of research at the center of the holiday.
So, why didn't we log in on the Net Project Foundation in just a few minutes?
Mainly CTD Timing
* All of them are Papyris, Net Script Flash, log type.dll pug-ins log.
* Some NPC murders/ attacks en masse:
* Camerawork for a kill-and-kill on some NPCs, based on the KFF from the PC via 'OF': A basic improvement in the DOAR+Nemesis relationship?
* On the move (for example, in the ice line) + some magic (i. e. an ice line), NPPC (in the middle of the day): Set up the SPID PID application (right on the MCCC) for all 5 consecutive trials in OFF.
In addition, 2.0's SPID default will have a format error, but as a result, the NPC's prior PPC will be applied.
At first, we made a major check of partial attacks and the action of OnHit and battle MODs (.dl).
I don't think there's any similar bug reports at least in English or German or French.
I've been asked to post that if there's one person who has similar CTD problems in the Japanese environment, it might be useful as a memory.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
They don't know about it.
When I look around, I'm optimistic that he's doing his job so well.
But maybe he's also a mental man.
I didn't retire in the name of mental illness, but I think I was limited before retirement.
And what I'm going to talk about today is the importance of mental health care.
I have been visited for a long time because of my bipolar disorder, but I believe that I have a longer relationship and a very good relationship with the nurse at the visiting station I'm using.
I'll tell you a lot of stories every week.
Of course he does what he needs to do to manage his medication, but I think most of all, I've come to see how pleasant communication is for those with mental illness.
Today we're discussing the gender difference and gender issues.
We talk about the sexual appetite of men and women, why she divorced, and why she should care for her.
Sometimes I dress like a woman.
But I've heard stories about grandmothers who can't work in the ward, who can't work in the hospital, who can't come to the hospital, who can't do it, who can't do it, who can't do it, who can't do it, and who can't do it, and who can't do it.
I'm using a little visiting station run by social justice, but I think it's a really good nurse who faces Frank as well as me with a mental illness.
She's beautiful, by the way.
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
It's very important to be able to care for patients with mental illness.
I'd like to take it if the doctor agrees.
So let's pick one of these.
So let's do that.
I'm sorry.
I know it's a false warning, but I came out in English and I was scared.
(Laughter)
There's a few possible causes, for example...
- I don't know what it looks like in Japanese.
-A language test failure
- The browser's settings are in English priority.
So let's look at the number of times that we're going to go through the loop.
And I'm going to ask you, why is it so hard to get an odd number?
It's strange.
There's a pattern that looks like it.
It's going to be repeated, followed by repeated.
It's called the Collona disaster.
But I can't concentrate on work at home.
It's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like,
It's not going to be easy to get a cup of coffee.
How are you guys doing?
I've got to do it again, and I've got to do it again, and I've got to do it without concentration.
I think you're getting the hang of it.
I'm going to touch it in the same way.
South Korea's hydrogen technology patent, five-tenths Chinese delay in carrying out the hydrogen economic road map.
The South Korean government released a hydrogen-economic road map in '09.
By 2022, they had distributed 65,000 fuel-powered vehicles and run the hydrogen station 3 0 points across the country.
So let's say that the price of hydrogen is 6,000 wons per kilo.
But this year, the fuel battery car is only 27% of the target.
The period of expansion of the hydrogen station in the core infrastructure is 38 percent of the target, and 8400 Wands are not much different from when the map was released.
And we've seen that the government's performance of the hydrogen economic road map is lower than the target.
The National Association of Economics (England) has issued a report on the hydrogen economy and its direction of policy in two days.
According to the report, the hydrogen industry’s core parts and materials are mostly dependent on US and Japan.
The carbon fiber from the core materials of fuel-celled cars is supplied by the East, the white - and the membran membrane by Kymera, the Du Pont, the United States of America, and the 3M.
The number of hydrogen patents in six countries leading the world's hydrogen market has increased by 4% a year.
The number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (20"-20-2020) and South Korea's fifth place in the world.
However, the whole school said, "In fact, six countries occupy a large part of the world's hydrogen market, and in fact, they mean lower in the competition."
The country's patent order is China, the United States, the EU, Japan.
China has expanded since '20', when it came to the U.S..
The number of patents registered in 2020 was 4 percent higher than Japan (974 cases) in "033" and 22 percent more than China (472).
The entire school has suggested that the hydrogen technology should be designated as ‘national strategic technology’ with a high rate of investment and research and tax revenues.
It's been a month and a half.

U.S., aid ammunition arrives in Ukraine (CNN.co.jp) and engage in military training - Yahoo! News
(CN) U.S. Department of State reported that by the second day, based on a security plan approved by President Biden, the equipment containing firearms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine.
Military aid amounts to 60 million dollars (U.S.), and by the end of the year, the last equipment, including four radars, will be transported to Ukraine, including mortars.
According to the US Department of Defense, these help includes deadly weapons such as anti-car missile Javelin.
The aim of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's ability to defend itself, for example, to strengthen the military forces that move around the border of Ukraine.
The U.S. alerts the movement of the Russians, talks with members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and plans to deal with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Byden approved arms aid on September 9th this year when Ukrainian President Selensky visited the American White House.
The U.S. military support for Ukraine reached about 450 million dollars this year.
Since Russia enforced the Ukraine Crimea Peninsula, the total amount of aid has gone up to more than 2.5 billion dollars.
The U.S. Army has been engaged in a Ukrainian training mission.
Last month, he sent state soldiers to the United States of Florida following a joint Ukrainian training program.
According to the U.S. Defense Department's statement, the U.S. Special Operations Forces in Europe also play a major role in Ukrainian Special Forces training and advice.
The number of U.S. Special Forces active in Ukraine has not been revealed as a covert operation.
Byden had an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, but the situation in Ukraine was tense.
The United States is also ready to face severe economic sanctions when the invasion takes place.

The process of re-examination of the inheritance and gift tax that prohibits preeminence is a direct blow to the pre-Cursion of the Party!
The first feature of the December 18th issue of the weekly Diamonds is "We speak with our family at the end of the year!"
It's called "Pretty-Spirit-Eyed Heritage."
In the ongoing debate about the combination of the inheritance tax and the gift tax, the concerned 2022 Law Regulations Act has been seen, but in the near future, it is very likely that the royal line of inheritances, the royal line of royalties, will become the "Declarator".
What's the difference between the rules of inheritance and the rules of inheritance?
The President of the People’s Party of Taxes, along with a direct attack on the MPs of the Republic of Korea, is fully informed of the basics of the gift and inheritance and the tax practice.
"Education of Diamonds"
● "From an asset to an office worker, from a wealthy person to an urban employee, from a more integrated view of the inheritance and the gift tax to a tax, we are going to take a serious look at the creation of a neutral tax system in choosing the time of the transfer of assets. —...
A statement released last year by the ruling party in 2021 by the High Line of Tax Reforms has caused great turmoil in the middle as well as among the wealthy.
That's because it changes the rules of inheritance and prohibits the "presidy" of inheritance tax policy.
The law of tax-responsive inheritance taxes is to reduce the property to be taxed.
The greatest gift of all has been widely used by the wealthy, as well as by office workers whose homes are located in three major urban areas, resulting in a small inheritance tax.
The discussion of the "counselization of the inheritance tax and the gift tax" .
Although it was observed on December 10th that the fastest introduction was to the 22-year-old tax amendment, it was reevaluated "to see where the current inheritance tax system and the calendar system are." "The tax obligation is a system which requires no tax on the transfer of property in the family within a limited amount of time."
In an interview with the editors of the Pre-Citizenial Taxation Survey, the president of the National Party says:
"The advantage of the transition of property, the loss of disadvantages and the equal burden of taxes are the most important.
"We're now in the middle of a simulation of what the problem is, and what it is that comes up with."
In the near future, there will be no doubt that you will cut a large hole in a direction that will disable your pre-payment as a tax measure.
So how exactly do the rules of inheritance and gift tax change?

"My Right Brother" from January 10, 2022.
It was decided that the FD original drama "My Right Brother" would be broadcast on TV from late night of January 10, 2022.
The book that originally produced the same popular cartoon by Molietosi, which was a series of comics from the 2018 Talk "BE LOVE" by the heroine, is a pure love story of men and women who have suffered too much in the past.
The main character is Shibuya Shibuya.
I'm going to go to college. I'm going to go to college.
There are many mysterious young people who are able to get a good night's sleep with the shoulders of reason.
Is it not true that he is attracted to the sea, which is similar to his brother who broke up after his parents' divorce?
"My Right Brother" was broadcast on the ground wave on January 10!
I hope you'll look forward to watching the FOD, and if you've ever seen it, you'll see more about the complex psychology of the ocean, the complex psychology of the world, the conflict and the changing of the two.
I hope you enjoy your original fans too.

[NFL] Three match passes, three match passes.
In this match, Jones threw the pass of the past-Pitoriots only three times.
This has been a small number since the 2 passes of Bills at the New York Jets fight in the third week of 1974.
In the 1974 Bills, there was the first time in the previous season, O.J. Simpson, an uninhabitable RB.
Bills beat him up in a run at Simpson and the other RB Jim Braxton.
This time, it was weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and it's not the same as the northern coast.
And on this day, the temperature almost fell once or twice, the wind blew 18 meters per hour, and before the match.
Bills was only local. He didn't change much in his choice of play.
Twenty-five runs on the path.
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no intercept, never failed.
There were four Red Zone break-ins in the 10 fence series and a score machine.
Since the end of the 3Q especially, we have moved on to the red zone three times.
I can only take three FGs in three of those.
The goal front fence at the end of the game.
The four-pointed Bills committed a penalty in 3rd and 9 and became 3rd and 14th.
18 yards to the finish line.
In 3rd & 14 QB Allen was surrounded by the rush of the Parisian fence and moved out of his pocket to the right.
And he threw a pass at TEdson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
In this play, it seems that Ace WRhffon Digs, who was on the right, had been free in front of the end zone when he ran through Shalocs.
4th and 18th, Allen aimed at WR Gabriel Davis running from the left in the end zone, but his pass ended in failure by being hit by D.B.l.
Bryant was covering the WR Cole Beasley in Bills, but on the way, he saw Allen's movements and let him go and react to the pass.
Allen missed two lecibers, threw a pass at the end zone two times.
The 4th down path might have been decided, but 3rddown didn't have to be targeted.
We'll take the first down in two plays.
It's just before two minits, so if I shorted out 4th and then Allen's ability to do his own run would be alive.

It's time to throw away the " &" and "times" item in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's BAZAR) - Harper's Bazaar - News Yahoo!
Sponge
It's not that it's not that easy to change it as often as it's recommended.
From a study of 2017, we know that even if the kitchen sponges were to be killed by microwaves every day, there would be a lot of bacteria in the range.
The German researcher who conducted the study recommended that sponges be replaced once a week to keep clean.
A cutting board.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pointed out that when there is a beginning of wear and tear, the board should be replaced.
Once the wound or grooves have progressed, it becomes harder to keep clean, and the bacteria reproduce.
If it's still okay, don't forget to drain a gallon of water with a bottle of unscentened bleach.
So let's do that.
It's clean water, it's dry, it's light, it's dry, it's dry, it's dry, it's light, it's dry, it's dry, it's dry, it's dry, it's dry, it's dry, it's dry, it's dry, it's dry, it's dry, it's dry, it's dry,
It's a dish that's broken and broken.
It's hard to get rid of your favorite mug, but the missing surface is a new bed for bacteria and bacteria.
It can also cause the lips to be cut off with a missing part, or the drink to spill.
That's my chance to buy my new favorite mug!

According to the MSI blog, it'll be over in about five minutes, but it won't be over in time.

"Evolution of Efforts" is a human hymn to celebrate the beginning of anime" (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
One of the most unusual among the recent youth cartoons is "the blade of destruction".
There is almost no battle, and training day in the morning and night has established that readers are not popular.
It's also possible that when a bunch of straws got separated from each other on the same jump cartoon, they were taught for two years, but they were able to draw only the touch and the rest of them were happy to skip it.
Well, one of the fascinating things about the exoticness of the land that moves around is that it's sometimes not so compatible.
Now, the work of the hero of the cut of destruction has begun with a solemn statement: "Don't let others take the right to life!"
The weak have no right, no choice, and with every power they can defeat the strong.
In the meantime, I've introduced you to a fosterer, near the left, who doesn't explain his intentions.
The first contact between Tanijiro and Shibuwa was asked, "What about you when your sister eats people?"
It's an unfair exchange of tales among fans.
It is possible that the moment will come when you will be forced to make that decision.
I'd say it's an open-minded initiative.
But he took a dominatrix, an amateur, to the narrow mountain and told him to come down to the bottom of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain is thin and full of holes, stone throwers and traps, and dies before entering the training.
Still, they smell the faint smell of a trap that has been put on human hands by their previous sense of smell and are barely able to avoid it.
But that doesn't mean that you suddenly become more physically able to avoid all of it!
The average person doesn't suddenly become stronger or stronger, or wake up with his own potential.
The exchange of effort, perhaps only rewards those who have worked hard, and no reward for efforts that have not been made, is a non-human hymn with superpower and a hard rule that is consistent with the book.

South Korean Samsung's new "DX division" that integrates domestic mobile devices and highlights user experience - Yahoo! News
After Samsung's electronic integration as a set of CE and IM sectors, he decided his name was DX, and he announced on the 12th of the year that he would reflect it in an organization revision at the end of the year.
Through various services from mobile to home power, we can read how to strengthen user experience.
Samsung's electronic analysis of the new DX sector by combining CE and I, VD, Live Electric, Medical Devices, MX, Network, and so on.
Samsung Electrics explained that “this change of name reflected the long-term business structure and future orientation and global leadership.”
He added that the products such as television, home power, smartphones, and communications, as well as service solutions that reflect customer needs, emphasized the intention of consumers to enjoy the optimised experience with ease.
The initiative to build a platform for products and services on a global scale beyond the borders of organizations has also reflected its name.
Samsung has already developed a strategy to make content and services available to the user via a multi-deviation experience, such as the Internet (IOT), artificial intelligence (AI), and mobile phones, which are based on devices.

Twenty-four collisions, trailer drivers are ill and careless (ANN) - Yahoo! News
It was found that 24 cars crashed in Kochi, Japan, that the trailer driver who was arrested and checked was not ill and that some neglect caused the accident.
Twenty-four trucks, cars and other vehicles collided at 41 A.M. 10 A.M., and 12 people suffered light damage.
Police arrested Katsumura, who was driving the trailer on 12 mornings for the first assault on a 71-year-old man.
In the wake of the accident, our suspect, trailer, continued without brakes, and the fire protection was making sure that he was unconscious shortly after the accident.
But according to the authorities, there are no wild suspects and may be some sort of neglect.

The 20th meta-human Olympics, which started with the 3rd volume, were completed in the 4th!
We are full of new devices focused only on one battle, as opposed to the one that quickly drew the curtain from the opening to the semifinals!
● "Ken-Man" four volumes, reviewer's name is Xho, and the meta-human professional has already started before the match!
In a word, this is one of the most carefully painted finals of the Kintexman v. Robin Mask.
It's not easy to go to a game that starts with the signing, and that's not boring.
This feeling of growing tension about the beginning of the century is indeed connected to the rise of our readers and it is a truly calculated production for this period.
And before the important final, another mountain, which we can't overlook, is the third final of the Teriman v. Ramenman.
"I'm going to play for you now!" she said, "and I'm going to play with you."
And try to hit chops.
But the occasional passing of Teriman stopped his sword and stood in the way of silence, and left the scene alone.
What's great about this is that both of them are already out, and we're not going to have the chance to fight Kim-Man in this competition.
But there's something about the man.
If you see this, you can't help but think about the achievements of the distant future!
This is what it's like to be a character, and I'm still a comics artist!
Their fight ends with less scale, but the famed expression of rammen's tears after the match.
Don't let God's luck hold you back!'
It's like, "Oh, my God, that's so cool!"
I think that's a great meta-word to the work itself.
But by letting Ramenman say those words, Dr. Zhiki has stabbed his lying hand in the face of his own will.
The reader said, "Well, then, does Kim-Man want to beat Robin with his wits?"
How?
And if you look at the other side of the picture, it's as if you've tied yourself up by your teacher.
I thought this was gonna be great.
I think that's one of the big points in this scroll.

The first winter Illemination in the Isle of Habarville, Takasaka, has begun, and the garden is surrounded by a kind light.
The winter Irmination, which began on 26th of February, is filled with 50,000 LED light bulbs, including 20-foot-high cytokines and other materials, along with sidewalks and lawns.
Visitors from Miyaga province came to Fukui for a long time and were surprised to find this place.
"It's so beautiful, it's so nice."
The Ilumination is the first to be able to feel healing while avoiding secrecy, and it lights from 5 to 8:30 Friday Saturday Sunday until February 25.
Also, on the 25th of the last day, there will be a button pot and a film showing.
I think there's only so many people who can read documents in order.

It's very easy to learn from Linux or Linux rather than from something that's a lot higher in abstracts like docker.

We've been working on this project for over a hundred years.
On 11 days, the Council for the Development of Agriculture, made up of local towns and JAs, expanded the PR activities of farm animals using live-commercials, which are used to sell goods on the Internet.
A group of loving soldiers at the National Market TV, which was first organized by the Tokyo port district, have appeared remote and have brought local charms along with special products.
A shop was set up with the "Customer X and Open Port Project" initiative, which was broadcast from the Nakamura vision house in Nakamura, Japan.
Katsuya Mitaka, who works as "Somrei", wear the "Nitorio" fabric, and introduces the attraction of the natural environment.
I also shared with the loving army officers how the boils were.
In Tokyo's studios, Emiko's "Fuck" village, and more than 300,000 registered .
When I told the audience how delicious it was, there was a lot of comments saying, "There's a lot of good things to drink and a lot of good things to eat."
Is there any way to post something in a form on the same PHP page?
We're going to use this as an example.
Isn't that what you're saying?
I want to plant it in my garden.
Is it hot in the summer?
Then when the flowers are finished in the spring, let's cut them with two inches.
So let's see if we can do that.

I'm sorry about this morning.
I'm not going to be able to get the power off my Nass computer.
What happened?
1) Open windows in the morning for ventilation.
This time, he's on the computer.
2) After a while, I went back to my room and noticed that the computer sounded like a pink router.
At this point, I thought the fans were only getting worse because of a drop in temperature (6°C).
So I'm going to heat up the room and try it again.
3.) Don't start.
When the power button is pressed, the light is turned on for only a moment, and the fans are moving, but immediately stop.
After that, I won't say a word.
I'll pull the power plug and try again, but it'll only take a second.
4.) Only the motherboard and ATX20 pins are connected and the other parts are removed and not started.
I suspect it's the PSU because I've always heard a PSU fan hit something.
I'll find the ATX power source that's on it later.
Maybe.
What if I don't?
You're gonna change the case with your mother.
I've seen rabbits in the wild recently.
So let's see.
So let's see if we can do that.
I live in northeast.
We'll be anywhere near you.
There's some in the garden or in the company parking lot.

So let's see if we can do that.
According to the source Unicode, 92 percent of the world's population uses text.
So let's see.
We're going to use the first, third and fifth laughing letters.
It's fun. It's fun.
I don't think many people use it on their own, even when they feel like it's impossible.
And that's what we're going to do.
I want you to keep that style.

I've brought it in once, but it's not enough to collect it from Miyagi.
(If you're new, you're free.)
* Invertnet
I didn't use it, but it would be free of charge.
So let's see if we can do that.
* Miscreants, postage boxes, plagiarism boxes.
* Sell it used to be.
Merkali, hard off
I don't know, I've never sold used computers.
It might be a wise choice to sell it while it's worth the money.

We've got a bunch of broken printers, old UPS and so on.
It's not like it's a trash size, so maybe it won't cost you money, but it's a little ahead of you.
It's a hobby. It's a collection of coins.
Let's do another one.
Coins that are distributed abroad are not worth anything.
In Japan, we change bills, but we don't change coins.
It's worth a fortune. It's worth a fortune.
He didn't do anything wrong, did he?

I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

So, I'm going to tell you a little bit about it, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about it, and I'm going to tell you about it.

I thought I was going to get a second set of 3's, but I didn't think I'd win the full set if I got a third set in x2.
I'll be defeated by the U.S., not by Japanese medals.
I think it was different than the person who got to the semifinals, but why are they in third place?
Let's say I want to plant a tree that is blindfolded in the garden.
So let's see if we can do that.
Thank you.
So, if you want to produce a feijore, it's better to plant trees nearby, such as olives, blueberry, plums, and so on.
How much money do we have to spend on each other's lives?
So let's see.
It depends on where we live and what we have to do with it.
I think we should stop living together.
It's very likely we're going to split up.
You better make a proper relationship, tie up, and then go to the Brydal to celebrate the wedding.
Living together has no merit.
I think you should stop.
So let's go back to the game center.
If you look at Regendrea, you'll see that he's a redecorating legendrea (^^;)
