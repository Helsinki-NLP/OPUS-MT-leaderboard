In addition to the reaction, the full-powered body touch, and the full-powered subservients, were increasingly escalating their violentness.

Driving on high heels is dangerous!
A young man's pedal error (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
Violations against road traffic laws.
It’s a big mistake to think that it’s only the elderly driver's problem, as reports of misadventures such as Pedal's missteps have been raised.
In the number of errors that occurred in the pedals (in 2015), more people were under 24 years of age and have resulted in 1032 accidents over 75.
It's important to call the younger ones to the same attention.
Do you want to take your foot off of me?
Are you sure you're safe?
There are no gender ratios or causes in this data, but unlike older people who are often thought to be caused by physical deterioration, such as driving skills or reflexes, younger people may be unaware of other things, such as music and conversation, and may be misinformed as to their mistakes, as well as their appearance.
In particular, some women choose various shoes according to their dress for the day: high heels, pans, sandals, mulls, and so on.
Some people find it difficult to change their clothes, knowing that it is not suitable for driving, but many have no idea how dangerous it is to drive.
However, driving on high heels and sandals is against road traffic laws.
One is to control steering, brake and other operations, and not to drive in such a way as to harm people in an accident.
The other is Article 71, which states that drivers must abide by what is set out by the Ministry of Public Security in the province of São Paulo, such as in Article 12 in the law code of road traffic laws of Miyazaki, in which they wear their clothes, which prevent high heels, and other driving, and not driving (excluding car drivers).
The same is true of each municipality and its view of driving as a violation of ‘feet that might prevent driving’ until it is not specified as high heels.
And that's why we're driving with high heels.
It's clear from the basics of safe pedal control.
For secure pedal control, hold your heel on the floor, step forward against the brake pedal, and lean to the right when you step on the accelerator.
It's important to be sure that your heel does not break, regardless of how the car behaves.
But the smaller the area of the heel on the floor, the smaller the area of the heel will always blend with the granular, and the smaller the distance to the pedal will not fit properly, because the heel is high and the whole foot is angled.
I think this could be dangerous.
Also, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pick with the heel, and the pedals can't get stuck, or the heel can get stuck and the heel can’t get stuck, and the heel can get stuck in the back of the pedal and the heel can get stuck.
There are also cases where the heel is stuck behind the pedal and the gas pedal is stuck on the back of the pedal.

I've been asked to go into bankruptcy about two billion yen debt - Yahoo!
The decline in the housing market, the frequent earthquake damage, has also affected the spread of consumer debris.
The TDB company code (TB company code: 530173983, capital gold, 199.2 million yen, Japan's 888-8 and 44 employees) filed for sub-contractor bankruptcy on August 30.
The application is only one legal attorney, Yoshida Nagata, Japan, 1-10-8, Yoshida-665-6038.
Our company was founded in June 1895, 1961, a reformed brick manufacturer in April.
At first, he started his project as a construction industry on the island of Tsukiji, a trading post in Nagata and Yosuke, Japan.
In October 86, he took over the conglomeration of the union trade and the business of the local industry.

Build a broad operating platform central to Japan, such as a large housemaker, a construction company, a roofmaker, and so on.
He had a reputation for being a brickmaker at the top of the island.
However, in the last year, the demand went down to about 134 million US dollars in annual sales during the 2018 period, due to the frequent earthquake damage from housing lost areas since Leiman Shock, Japan's earthquake, and Kakuma's earthquake.
In addition to the decline in profits due to increased fuel prices, there was a series of deficits with overprivileged debt due to inventory and investment in equipment, which had to be severely funded.
Thus, the financial institutions were trying to rebuild their operations by demanding that their loans be paid back, but the situation was getting worse and worse.
He refused to continue his project and was taken into action.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is expected to be about two billion yen.

Especially in the latter part of the war, the form of the ball was stable, and the ball was so powerful and so powerful that it kept playing with the opponent.

In a discussion of the main operation, the director of the fishing union Ejima Tanikawa, who is a fisherman, pointed out that "it is necessary to raise the opinion from below."
An umbrella station organized a meeting to resolve one of the problems and then draw the conclusion as a city fishing partnership.
The director of Shibuya’s Bilar Fisheries Association says "We need to talk to the fishermen as well as to the brokers."
With the support of the country and the arrival of seven new ships in the next year, the "first priority is to restore the catch" was the idea of a full-time discussion and the idea of improving the environment.

"Beauty and ugly" is a little bit of paper?
The image of the snake with the beautiful girls of the works - Yahoo! News
Is there anything in common between my mysterious beauty and my shadowy look?
In the 1950s, a collection of works was released, focusing on the beautiful girls, who were known as 'terrible Manga' and who were the first ones to be known as 'terrible Manga'.
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
Is that what's attractive with the shadow?
Five of the beautiful girls from the show.
There was also a statement in the introduction to the "Beauty's Collections" saying, "They stand out in the face of fear, uglyness, shocking events and developments, but the contrast between the beautiful faces of their beauty, and the expression of their envy, may be more fear."
There are many of the key words in the works, but snakes are captured by the viewer as "dug creatures", and there are many different ways of receiving and receiving people who feel "beautiful".
Some people say they like reptiles.
So, beauty and uglyness may be the snake because of the human senses.
This creature is also worshiped as a spirit creature from ancient times, and the home where the White Serpent resides is a good reminder.
In the "Serpent" work, there's "Mama" in 1965!
She's a beautiful woman with a shadow.
Can we say "Colour Beauty" in a word that sounds like something that's in common with the beautiful girls in the drawing?
Among other things, the "Direct" character, which was featured in "Sunday the Week" from 1969 to '1969, is a figure of beauty, but it reminds us of the snake's "where the snake finds its way into deep sleep every hundred years in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth.

According to surveys by the NPO lawmen and others, around 3,700 locations have been active throughout the country this year.
In Fukui, there are 24 cases of increase last year.
I don't know why I'm in the children's cafeteria right now.
Yuasa Yuasa, a social activist and director of the NPO, explained the background and meaning of the talk held in Sakurai city.
Younger age left the area lonely, and business districts dwindled.
There's no place for people to meet.
"It was necessary to have a local contact center in which people are in contact with each other."
The children's cafeteria is a place where old people join in.
Not only do they eliminate food, but they also contribute to child rearing and the health of the elderly.
Cut the chain of poverty and cheer up the community.
(Laughter)
It's been a long time since I've been here.
There are several to hundreds of people in the audience, from private homes to temples.
It's starting to feel like the people who want to do it.
That low threshold is fascinating.
It's hard to get the money and the staff.
I'm not going to talk about it. I'm going to talk about it.
Yuasa says being connected to society can be a safe net for disaster and other things.
It's like hope for a closed society.

"The real killer" (FRIDAY) - Yaho! News
"The Iranian drone "Abbeer" used in the bombing has been dramatically improved in recent years by analyzing U.S. military drones that have crashed.
It's cheap. It's about 1,000 kilometers away.
It's also very strong that the radar is hard to catch because of the low-air flight."
On September 14, the oil plant of Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Arabia's ‘Sabaralamco’ was bombed by 10 military drones.
Shortly after this, Yemen's anti-government group Husi has issued a statement of crime.
"I'm sure it's Iran, led by President Rouhani, who does not approve of Saudi Arabia’s profiting from crude oil in a situation where its country cannot export oil.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production was stopped, and oil prices rose 15%.
Some say the oil shock is coming back.
"Since Trump promises to withdraw US troops from the Middle East, at least until next year's elections, we want to avoid military intervention, and we know that Iran will continue to attack the Hungarians in hiding, but the United States is not going to be able to endure, and it is very likely that Trump will be determined to attack Iran in the future."
The US and Iran's "Special War" is at a critical point.
The reason why Super-Synthesis YouTuber has become a full-time employee.
I'm going to ask the boss who hired me (BizSPA!)
9/ 27 (gold) 8:47 distribution
YouTube, now the most popular YouTube video around youth.
While it is not uncommon now for companies to use their products to advertise their products, some companies have started an unusual scheme called YouTube.
It's a direct marketing mix (DmMiX) based primarily on corporate CRM.
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
This time, I spoke to Kobayashi Kobayashi, director of DmMiX, who is also the first representative of the children's company and staff that was actually adopted by YouTuber.
I want to support young people who are working hard on YouTuber.
I'm going to talk about YouTube.
Kobayashi: The profession of YouTuber is now the envy of many young people.
I'm sure you'll see more and more young people coming up with a career that they're going to want to do in the future.
The company has always adopted and supported young people who pursue dreams like bandman and jokers.
So, we're going to do a couple of videos on YouTube.
So why did you want to do that?
Kobayashi: There's a reality that many young people are eager for a career called YouTuber, but most YouTubers can't make as much money as they think they can.
There's not a lot of creators who make and post videos while they're at work, or they don't recognize the presence of YouTuber in their family.
This initiative provides the creators with the environment for their salary and content production.
I'm going to support the initiative with the support of YouTube, which at first becomes very unstable.

"We hope that South Korea will return to the GSOMIA."
The deputy secretary of the United States of Korea, Napper, in an interview with a single mother-in-law newspaper at the American ambassador's residence in the city on 27 days, said about the Japan Military Information Protection Convention (GSOMIA), which will expire on the 23th of March:
It is not uncommon for U.S. officials to refer to the GSOMIA re-declaration.
The GSOMIA is the basis for Japan, the United States, the United States, and the rest of the world to share missile launch information and so on.
South Korea will inform Japan that its agreement will be broken in August, and if it expires, it will destroy the framework for protecting military information in Japan.
"I can't deal effectively with the crisis without the GSOMIA."
"There's time to expire."
"It's the first time in history," he said, "and it is essential that the Korean Day, which shares values such as democracy and human rights, joins in the alliance."
The current deterioration of the relationship in Korea is "instrumental to the interests of the United States."
He said, "I don't intend to be a mediator," but he said, "I'm going to act in a positive way so that I can be separated and buried."
I'm sorry.

I've noticed that there's a legend of the city, and that's the face of the demon.
To the mother-in-law who has lost her face, a kind wife continues to sing to her mother to help her without being surprised.
I felt the roots of the piety and kindness of Fukui's people.
With hints, Katsuya made interviews for her original work, and the story of a gentle demon couple and a boy.
Since June, I've been living my life in a warm water painting with the "0 scene" and the materials of my book have been added.

A retail shop in Okakayama, Japan, and a special sale.
It's the best place to sell major electric power before tax increases.
From 8 to 8%, on the 28th weekend before the tax tax increase, families from house to house in Okayama, along with families came running in and out of the supermarkets.

The tax increase is a way to put tax rates, such as food and drink, in the home center and in the supermarkets and in the supermarkets.

I don't think Clopp would have been willing to bet on us for the best moment in 2019, in Barcelona, with a lot of experts and myself and a quarter of a inch of the team in Messi and Suarez, and that's like a death sentence, we got a small chance and we could make it.
I don't even know where I am this time because I'm a man plagued by the obsession of self-control. I don't like getting drunk.

This year's salmon shrimp, which was born this year, successfully shot in the deep sea of the Bay of the Sun, is off the coast of Shizuzuoka.
This was the case with the Saklar shrimp project, a project of the Pacific Institute of Industrial Clusters, conducted by physiologists such as Shizuoka, who successfully filmed the salmon shrimp that may have been born in the spring of the year at the time of the egging season in the Gulf of Sun.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the participants want to connect it to the survival of the many mysterious salmon shrimps.
Photo taken near the bottom of the sea off the city's Shizuya district.
We've got about 300 per seven minutes.
The traditional perception that the salmon shrimp in the deep waters during the day "are forming a certain group at the bottom of the sea."
It's about 40 millimeters long, and it's only about 23 millimeters long.
We cross-referenced each season data from the fried salmon shrimp and identified the ovarian period.
A detailed analysis will be sent to the team's private software technology departments and to the University of San Francisco in the U.S.
“I want to see the living pictures of the growing population, including the shrimp.”

The residents of Chiba province will be free to enter until the end of the month.
Many came at the opening of the park under Thursday, and at the entrance gate, the Mascot character Chiba was welcomed by the town's cheers.
The roof has been covered with blue sheets, and the facilities have been repaired, while half of the restaurants have been renovated.

Four strong decisions: The North Sea newspaper, the electronic version
On the 28th day, the 69th round of all the way started with the North Sea newspaper in Sapporo, Japan.
Thirty people entered the competition to compete for the top of the street amateurs, and the best four came out.
The semi-finals will be made by Asano-san (48), Sapporo-Shuto-san (48) = Sapporo (52), Tamma-san (52) = Riyadashi-san (72) = Shibuya-san (72) = the high-freaking area (75) = the Northview district.
The previous year's champion, Rikudou-san (49) was defeated by Asano-san, the eighth-time champion of the competition in the finals.
The youngest person in the history of the convention, Katsuya-sama, (8) Sapporo-Sapporo, was defeated by the previous year's junior Unoi Nakajima, who won the World Cup.
Nakai-san dropped out in the next two battles.
The 29th is the semi-final of the entire road from 1:30 p.m. to the final.
From 0 a.m. to 26th A.M.
They're all from the North Sea newspaper.

The world's champions, Makota's wise, the Dalai Lama, a step-by-step lead!
Boy Singles.
Japan's national champion, who won six medals at the big football event at Budminton, Switzerland, 25th World Cup, in August, will join China OOP, which starts on 17th.
Here we are looking back at the previous half of the battle between May and August, next year's Tokyo Olympics.
From May to May, Budminton's Olympic Olympics (more than Super500) were canceled.
Two of the two who won the two championships in the first four games and the two of Taiwan’s Tianhu Tianchen.
Michida is the world champion, and S1,000 is the winner of the world-runing point of the competition, which will lead directly to Indonesia (S1,000) and the Olympic race.
In addition, Momata also controls Japan (S750).
From May to May, the Sdiman Cup (May / China), Indonesia O (July), Japan O (July), and the World Cup (August).
It's a little bit less than the other top players, but it's a little less of a slow schedule for the rest of the team.
August was only one world championship tournament, and I'm not going to be more tired than it was during the match.
The results of a series of major games since September are expected.
Ace from Taiwan.
Watch out for the young ones in Thailand!
A roundabout competition that also won the top games in Indonesia and Thailand (S500) is already on the 7th.
He was in the war in September at the local capital of S300 and won an impressive win.
It's a very powerful sport, but it doesn't bother to fight.
There's no big problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, winning high points in the first half of the war will make it easier to adjust schedules for future conventions.
Until last year, it was a lack of explosive power, but this year’s increased level of professional stability has made it possible to continue doing well.
To the world's number one Michida, it's going to be worse than ever.
Except for these two players, the results were left in the pre-war battle of Ace Cantafon, Thailand's young player, and the Indian rhino Planets B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen, who are struggling on their own as European forces.
Cantafon has the power to win the top, not being able to finish the top games, not going to the top, not going to the top, not going to the top, not going to the top, not going to the top.
There is still a rough side, but 20-year-old (21-year-old 18-year-old) who has become the equivalent of a top player seems to have a lot of potential for leaping in the ring.
And Sy Planetis B. has stepped out of India with a single player.
The Indian scene since the middle of the war needs to be on guard, just as Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Slykans Kidambi, who is late for injury, will be on the move.
New costs for mobile phones, low prices for fair competition:
"The new cost plan for the mobile phone company, which will be accompanied by the Act of Electric Communications in January, has been launched."
But it's a bit of a dead end.
Despite the high expectations for lower prices, the price competition did not take place.
A major factor is the continued presence of three major companies.
It's better for consumers to have a reasonable competition and to have a convenient fee system.
I'd like to ask for the efforts of every cell phone.
The reform law prohibits a set discount for terminal and communications costs.
Because instead of selling terminals, the cost of communications was set at a high price.
Softbanks and KDDI (au) announced a plan to reduce the maximum cost of the terminal to half.
Both companies, however, have an "SIMlock" system that can't use another line for 00 days.
NTTdocomo only uses its own network of subscribers to pay up to three-thirds of their terminals.
It seems that the three companies are continuing their ‘invasion’ to prevent the transfer to another company.
The SIM lock has been presented by the Ministry of State to require immediate decommissioning.
We need to respond quickly as well.
The delay was due to the failure of the base and other communications networks to follow the plan.
They were expected to be the detonators of the devalued competition.
Maybe he had a sweet outlook.
It's not clear when the service starts or how much it costs.
I want you to work with the responsibilities of the infrastructure industry.
The change in the bill was triggered by what the director of the office said:
"I think the competition is about to begin," he complained about three new costs, "and I don't really think it's okay."
I just don't think that's going to distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
Before the government tells us what to do, we should expand the competition for customer status.
The cost system is very complex, and it's not easy to compare.
The consumer agency has called attention to the fact that there are more than half the costs of consumer advertising, while the terminals are advertising “to be the largest and most expensive.”
We need to make a clear and clear explanation of ourselves and our users' misunderstandings.

"The U.S. FLCKle is rough play. It's not what we call "the former England champion of Tuckle."
Japan's World Cup of rugby (WC) was the last of 20 countries to appear on 26 days, the United States lost 7-45 in England.
The black star has been launched, but later on, the ruff play played by FL John Quill brings waves.
One exit in a way like adding a shorder tackle to the face of the other.
A video of the actual scene has also been released in foreign media, complaining that former England champions are not "indulgent and mean play" or "tuckle".
"Indulgent and despicable play" and a wave abroad!
The actual moment of the "face danger" played by U.S. champion Quill in the midst of a one-time riot.
The hot fight has crossed the line.
I picked you up at 0-38 in the last 29 minutes.
The hostile General Farrell, General England's General, has somewhat lost balance as he grabs the other side's path.
It was Quill who went to tackle this.
I just woke up, not from the waist down, but from the upper body and hit me hard on the upper body.
It's a very, very simple way of doing it.
Farrell was blown to pieces.
A violent protest by the English player trying to push the Quill for lack of justification.
The two players came together, and it became an explosive atmosphere.
As a result of the TMO, Quill got out with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad look, but some of the audience who wanted to play fair asked him to make a round.
The "Lugby W Cup 2019" featured the headline "The U.S. Players Are Out for a Fierce Play, England Wins" .
"Kil was reported to have taken a mean shorder chase on the face of the British star Farrell and had become a war between almost two soldiers."
Here are some comments from former England champion and commentator Wugo Moña:
"It's insulting, it's despicable, it's not called a Tuckle, it's a mean play."
The US, without a single match, managed to escape its final defeat for 81 minutes.
But Quill's play left behind a bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health and Labor released the first 424 of the 424 hospitals in the country's 455 public hospitals and hospitals, such as Red and Red, where they found “a lack of medical record”.
In Fukui province, the Ministry of Health has tested the treatment of the four facilities in the public and public hospitals, including the four facilities of a young Japanese hospital in Tatsuya, Nakata, Nakata, Nakata, Japan.
"I don't know what I'm talking about.
In order to curb the growing cost of medical care in the old age, we have taken a different approach, considering that we need to encourage reorganization and integration with hospitals in the competition region.
"I'm asking for a full-time review of the patient's hospital in September to come to a conclusion by September next year.
There is no force, but the fear that the nearest hospital will be gone is expected by local chiefs and residents.
I released it at a meeting that day.
The target hospital was 29%, and there were relatively few beds.
In the province of the capital, the percentage was high in the order of the New Labyrinz (53/7%), the northern coast (48/6%), the Miyagi (47/5%), the Yamaguchi (46.7%), and the Okayama (43/3%).
The number of targets was 54 in the North Coast, and only zero on the coast.
Based on 20"7-year-old data, the Ministry of Health has investigated the "high-speed" and "epidemic" hospitals in public and public hospitals for seriously ill patients.
Nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency care, have been analyzed to determine whether hospitals in conflict are within 20 minutes of the car and have decided the need to publish the hospital's name.
We need you to consider decommissioning hospitals and moving some medical care to other hospitals.
Medical costs skyrocket in 25 years when the whole generation is over 75.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has a national goal to reduce the number of beds in hospitals with 246,000 (8 years).
Now there are more beds for nurses, more for nurses, more for health care, and more for "higher" and "epidemic", while the elderly lack the need for more rehabilitation.
In order to respond to aging, we need not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase the level of rehabilitation.
Over the hospital’s resurrection consolidation plan, the community health plan has set the number of beds needed for 25 years by each municipality.
The whole country is divided into 339 sectors, with municipalities and medical personnel consulting, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Labor wants to stimulate the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with limited success.
For the first time in eight years, you've been in the North Sea, and you've been doing this for the past few years.
On September 27th, the total fire-proof training for the eruption of the Squeeze River was performed in the forest in the Isle, the Seven, and the town of Sudoku.
About 400 people from 20 agencies, including roads and three towns, participated.

100,000 students in Vancouver's climate demonstration for school vacations - Yehoo! News
About 100,000 citizens, mainly students who were moved by 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to protest against climate change.
Climate protest in Vancouver.
The march took place from Vancouver city hall across Camby Bridge to the library downtown.
A few hours before the beginning of the city hall, the people with the placards began to gather to fill a few blocks of road in front of the city hall at the starting time.
After that, the number of participants continued to increase until eventually more than 100,000 people joined.
On the road along the road, police also worked together to keep everyone on the road for hours.
At the UN Climate Action Summit in New York City, Vancouver has hosted many different events that will be thinking about warming in the past weekend.
On the last day, 27 Fridays for the future, a school strike will take place.
The students who took off from school this day told adults that they wanted to protect the planet until they had missed school, and many adults who took part in the work said they would do their best to learn the future of children seriously.
The Ministry of Agriculture, 9 province recommended for the swine collera vaccine. - Yahoo! News
On 27 days, the Ministry of Agriculture has issued a amendment to a anti-traumatic vaccine to prevent the spread of “colora” pigs, which are not yet recognized.
The districts will choose nine different districts, including pigs and wild boars that have been identified as infected.
Moving such things as fertilized pigs and fertilized eggs is limited in the range, but allows distribution of meat and processed products.
After a public comment (in public opinion), if it is early enough, the process will be completed during the month of January.
By using vaccines and allowing foreign distribution, such as meat, we can no longer be a clean country recognized by international agencies, and could affect the export of pork.
Japan has been on hold since September.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture has set up a "recommunity region" in the opinion of experts on areas that are more likely to be infected by wild wild wild wild boars and pigs.
The city district has created a vaccine program that combines the range, timing, number and how to proceed, and allows it to be used by the Ministry of Justice.
Seven other districts are listed as the recommended regional plan for inoculations: Iwayama, Ishiyama, Fukui, Nano, Miyaga.
The district will determine and determine the situation when the hands are corrected.
Inoculated pigs, sperm, fertilized eggs, dead bodies, and excretions are restricted by principle.
In the case of processed meat and processed goods, they do not depend on the cost of distribution or the impact of farmers, but they allow the distribution to be virtually out of the country.
We're going to do everything we can to keep the virus from spreading.
I'm also involved in preventing the spread of the disease.
The amendment to guidelines was compiled at an informed meeting held the same day at a anti-traumatic task force meeting.
From now on, we will conduct opinions and public comments to the city's provinces until the 7th of November and will administer new anti-traumatic guides.

At last year's time, I left Melbourne Victory, a league of Australian A League, and now I'm an independent Japanese member of Japan, MF, has acted in a remarkable way.
Did you actually go to the game?
The truth will be revealed.
After updating his Twitter account late at night in Japan, he made an open approach to a club that said, "Give me an offer, but I don't need money, but I need to play with a great team and a wonderful teammate."
The person who sent the reverse offer is the world-class Manchester United.
Why did you make a grand request to one of Premium League's strongest clubs?
The initiative was published on 24th, an article published in the Australian edition of FOX Sports.
In an article entitled "Five FWs which Manchester United may catch during the crisis of casualties," five uninhabitable players were picked up at the moment.
Among the players such as Hattem ben Alpha and Jessupe Rossi and Wilfred Boney, there was a name for the show.
Currently, casualties such as MFPaul Poggba, DDF Rook Shaw, DDF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malhal, FW Marcus Rashford are in a state of emergency.
The Red Devil, led by Orle Gunner Surshar, has been forced by the League to make a 2-22-feet break and a hard-to-go-go-go-a-do-a-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-all-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
That's where the Shibuya media named him as the candidate for a new war force for Teko.
The article's analysis of the contract of Harada as a creative side player, rather than as a striker, is that it can fill a hole in which Andreas Perera is buried.
The 9th score for the 18 games in Melbourne Victory is a "hard record," but "33-year-old Shinda has to leave his entertainment and take full note" of the country's national entertainment.
Is it true what you're trying to do?
I'm also interested in the movement of United States for the veterans who publicly declare that Tokyo will be their target next year.
500 mobile translators have been installed.
A mobile translator who lends free money to 500 stores, including shops in Japan City.
On the 26th day, the Japan Council of Merchants announced that 500 of them have been installed in a company that lends free "poquetokes" to its employees' offices.
It would be good for the translators to be concentrated in the same region, the first of the countries in the country, and to be noted for their ability to respond better.
We're going to borrow from the food store, 236, the retailer, 3 and 7 and 34 other.
That's 60 per cent of the city.
We also started showing our loans to the Google Map and using our mobile phones to get to know the location of the "a foreign language store".
You can access it from sites like the beach lake tourist zone.
In April, Poketoket's free loan to the 74th language was launched by nine different organizations in the city with the declaration of "The Japan's 1st Invading City" .
It buys 500 of them and lends them to small businesses for two years that meet requirements such as hospitality, authentication, and cash-responsibility.
The official of the Council said, "I want you to join us in the development of new foreign customers in the business environment."
Do you need to take a step back?
Mr. Caddy, best shot today.
1W shots don't necessarily work well.
So, we're going to use the second test, which is the second test, and we're going to hit the ball on the ground, so called "really-dola."
Now, a lot of players are doing this on the ground, although it's also a risk that the ball will spread because of the volume of the head.
The first victory of the tour awaits you.
In the first year of pro seven, 24 years of age, he was six feet tall and small, and he is now seven in the Drebbing Division (an average of 304.02 yd).
I'm very proud of the long shot.
"I thought I'd try straightdra."
From practice rounds, drop the ball on the lawn of Tieria, and even run 1W.
In the case of Big Carrie, you're using a lot of Timup, but you're using directdras in small halls and so on.
It can be used in halls where the eyes are falling down.
The ballistics monitors record 270 yd to 280 yd on Carrie.
That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japanese Tours championship in June, there's only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is UT at 17 degrees.
I'm happy to hear how the tour team has been surprised to hear the noise of the sounds from the gallery where they saw it.
The trick is to roll the club horizontally.
I'm going to go straight to the right, and I'm going to go straight to the right, and I'm going to go straight to the top of my head, and I'm going to go straight to the right.
The ball won't be caught, and the risk of the slice is that the left side can be erased (no turning left).
I'll tell Cantane.

While the speech is being highlighted, there are voices insulting to greta:
"Why do adults laugh at their children and threaten them?"
Political critic said on American TV that she is mentally ill, "used by her parents and international left wing," and apologized.
In Japan, there are many online comments that comment on part of Gregora's comments, such as, "It’s better to go to school."
In the meantime, Greta posted on Twitter on September 26, saying, "Why do adults laugh at teenagers and children and spend time threatening them?"
"I think of lies and conspiracy as much as I can think of."
"You see, the people who hate me are still active, as you can see, my clothes, my attitude, and I'm going after different people.
He pointed out that it seems like they are distracting the point of conversation because they do not want to face the climate or environmental crisis.

So I thought I could do it in the first place, so I could do it in the second place, but I couldn't do it.
- Eagle 6, did you see the winner at Bardi, number seven?
I'm still stuck here after I hit Boggy on number four, and I'm just trying to get back to you.
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
- What did you get at the convention now?
It's good to see that Fairway has been able to keep pace with the narrow courses.
So I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
- What's the difference?
So this is where we're going to go to the next video. So, we're going to go to the next video.
I didn't really care about it.
It wasn't much else that changed, but it was just a competition where there were fewer Japanese players, so I came to the game with the feeling that I'm not going to lose the competition for the rest of the world.
I'd like to win another game if I don't win more than one game, and I've got ZOZO rights in the near future, so I'm going to try to get ahead of the competition.
How do you keep it as "forgotten" to prevent dementia?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
A major pharmaceutical company or a university hospital has been trying to develop a treatment for dementia that has failed.
But it's becoming apparent that the relationship between dementia and living habits can be very mild and even more forgotten.
I've spoken to Professor Yoichi from the University of Tokyo Hospital.
You're not going to have dementia.
So, we're looking for a cure.
It's not like we're going to be able to do this in any way, whether we're going to be doing this in a different way, from the major to the major.
But it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop a new form of dementia.
Donpell, a common drug in Japan, is already out of insurance in some countries abroad and cannot be expected to have a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people are able to live longer, with fewer deaths due to infections and accidents, and fewer cancer deaths due to massive advances in the treatment of anti-cancers.
And that's why we're seeing more cases of dementia.
We need to make sure that society as a whole isn't the only one that can solve this problem.
How to keep things as "forgotten" as they are.
- Who's vulnerable to dementia?
Even if it's inevitable, it can be kept as low as possible and "forgotten".
It's not a disease, it's a disease.
So let's look at some examples.
It's not a disease. It's not a disease.
It's a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol.
It's not just about the economy. It's about the economy.
In some parts of the United States, for example, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are available for storage: frozen hamburgers, pizzas, chicken.
There are people who can't use gas or electricity and live in a environment where they can't cook.
It makes you eat less vegetables, less protein, and more fats and sugars.
I'm not going to be able to do that.
It's possible that there's a similar situation in Japan.
It's very common for people who don't think about things, and who don't work, to be prone to dementia.
So, to prevent dementia, we need to read books from day to day and think about things.
In Osaka, in Osaka, we also have a full-scale cave VR in Osaka, where we have a special treat for tourism and production, as well.
As a result of the "PR of tourism and special products in the area", the "Marshe" in a sunny country began on 27 days in the square of JR's Osaka Station.
Earlier this month, the new city, which was hit by the local heavy rains, created the VR's (virtually real-life) experience section of the Great Cave, which attracted the people of the Cemetery region.
Seven cities are in town.
There were corners, such as the construction of a matting tape, the making of a denimkey holder, and the making of a kaleidoscope from an astronomical telescope.
In the VR experience of the Grand Cave, visitors used their own Goggles to fake their way through the caves.
A woman from Izaki, Japan, said, "If you turn to the left, you can see the view on the right, you can see the view on the right, you're really walking inside, and if you have the opportunity, you'd like to experience a real cave."
You are the brother of Takanoki-kun, the newspaper Ates of the Dereliction.
The brother of the two of the two sons of Seikichi, who was motivated by the Shibuya Association to quit on his own due to violent sumo-gang attacks and other attacks on the Japanese Shibuya-kun, said he would take a firm stand for the fact that he had been punished for his actions that had gone beyond his leadership on the 28th day: he would start from a negative point of view.
I was interviewed at Tokyo and Tokyo's Dumas Arts Museum.
On the 27th, Takanoki opened a press conference hoping to continue.
but since then, I've been unable to contact you.
"I grew up in the same environment, but my brother and I thought differently."
Jaguar F-PACE, for the first major improvement... (Responsible) - Yahoo! News
The first Jaguar to cross-over-UV, an improved prototype "FPACE" (FPACE) was first captured in southern Europe.
F-PACE is the origin of the four-sea concept "C-X17" first published in 2013.
In 2014, the 5-Sheeter edition was officially viewed as "F-PACE" at the Frankfurt Motors Show in 2015.
The following year, the first modern model was released, this time the first face lift.
The prototype is covered with thick camouflage, but we can see some of the new designs.
In addition to the more compact and thinly designed headlights, side-air interfaces seem to have been modified into a more portable ellipse.
Grills are completely faked, but we're sure they'll be re-engineered.
In the rear end, you can see some of the newly updated detail lights, with a long crosslight at the top.
It's possible that the design, like the current model, has been compactly modified.
In the cabin, the new digital clusters, HVAC control screens, steering wheel, and gear collector will be updated, as well as their "Pivi Pros" touch screen installation system.
Power trays are expected to set up the 6th straight cylinder in a hybridized column, as well as a 4.0 L (.0 L) of T-V-V-A-V-A-T-T-A-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-E-T-T-E-T-T.
