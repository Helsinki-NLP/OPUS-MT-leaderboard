Congressional Councilman Wells, concerned about shame (AM)
The proposal to change the name of the Welsh Parliament from AM (Assemble Member) to MWP (Member of the World Palace) has caused confusion among some of them.
The plan to change the name of the Welsh Parliament is the beginning.
MPs from all walks of life are concerned that this could lead to stupid events.
A member of the Labor Party is concerned that he will follow the rhymes of "Twp" and "Pwp" in the party.
For the benefit of non- Welsh readers, Twp in Wales means "duck," Pwp means "shit".
A member of the Pride Camry Party said that the party's entire party proposed alternative proposals as being unhappy.
In a change of name, a member of the Welsh conservative Party said that although the party is "open," the pronunciation of the MWP and the "duck" is not much different:
It's called the "w" because it's the same thing as "u" in the Welsh accent.
"The final decision regarding the call of parliament is, of course, left to the council itself."
In 2017, the Wells Regulation Act authorized the Council of Wales to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a civil council meeting on the proposal, which revealed that there was a great deal of approval for the changes in parliament's name from Assemble to Welch Palace.
In the name of the Council of Wales, the committee supported the idea of WMP, but the idea of MWP was the most popular in the civil council.
The senator has actually proposed alternative proposals, but the way to reach an agreement could be a headache for President Erin Jones, who is expected to present a bill for a change of name within a few weeks.
The reform bill will include rules on the council’s vote of distrust and other reforms on how Congress operates, including the structure of the committee system.
In the process of the bill, the MP has the final right to decide what to call himself.
Macedonia has voted to change the country's name
A vote will be held on Sunday to ask whether the name will be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The poll was organized to resolve decades of debate with the neighboring Greek country, which claims to be Macedonia in the country.
Greece has long argued that the name of its neighbors in the north is worthy of claim to ownership of Greek territory, and has strongly opposed Macedonia’s joining the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's president Jorge Ivanov, who opposes the change of the country's name, said he intends to ignore the vote:
However, supporters of the polls, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that a change of name is a price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent as the church in Harrem struggles
"When you talk to an old man, you always hear that there were bars and churches in the past."
Now none of them exist.
No wonder the bar is gone.
We're communicating in a different way.
"The bar is no longer the neighborhood living room that goes through."
As for the church, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the authorities expect, but will sooner or later be a start.
In addition, the church is replaced by apartments and apartments, and he says the people who live there will not cooperate with the maintenance of the church:
"I think the majority of the people who live in this building will be white," he says, "this will speed up the closing of the church, because most of them who migrate should not be in the church."
The church was built by a white congregation, and then Harem became a black city.
The original white Mesopotamian congregation went away in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying nearby owned the building.
St. Martin was inherited by a black congregation, a pastor, John Howard Johnson.
The fires in 1939 severely damaged the church, but Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it and requested a carion.
Reverend John Howard Johnson and the successor of Reverend Johnson named him St. Martin, "The Bell of the Poor Man."
In July, the player who came to play the carion called, "The Treasures of Culture" and "The Greatest Historical Musical Instruments."
According to Tifalny Gun, of the University of Michigan, Dionysio Dionysio D. Lind, the first carion played by a black musician in the world, came to Carrión in a church along the river 18 years ago.
Mr. Merwether said St. Martin didn't replace him.
In the past few months, the story of St. Martin has been told by the builders, some of it by the faithful leaders of the church, and others by the diocese.
In July, the governing body of the parish sent a letter to the parish asking that the parish be concerned about the cost, but it was not involved in hiring architects and contractors.
Some of the parishioners complained that the bishop's actions were inconsistency.
A shark attacked a 13-year-old kid in a lobster, California.
Authorities reported on Saturday that a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy swimming in lobster, California, the day the lobster season began.
Just before 7:00 A.M., it happened at Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
According to KSWB-TV, Chad Hamel was bathing with his friend on Saturday morning in San Diego for an hour and a half when the boy heard the call for help and went to and pulled him up.
Hamel thought that at first, he was just too excited to take the lobster, but soon he realized that it was a scream.
He bit me!
His entire clavicle was torn apart when he rescued the boy.
"All the sharks are out of the ocean."
The boy is in danger of being airlifted to Rudy Children's Hospital in San Diego.
We still don't know the kind of shark that attacked us.
In an interview, lifeguard Captain Larry Jails said that while it was confirmed that the shark was there a few weeks ago, it was not dangerous.
And there's a very serious trauma to the top of the boy's body.
For investigation and security, authorities have sealed off for 48 hours from Pont Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Esinitas.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered dangerous.
Seinsbury's plan is a big step forward to the beauty market in England.
Seinsbury hired Bots, Superdrugs, and Devenhams in their department-style beauty corridors.
As a result of a huge breakthrough in the British beauty market, which continues to grow while fashion and household products are on the decline, more beauty corridors will be tested at 11 beauty shops across the country and will be expanded next year.
The investment in beauty was created by trying to figure out how to use all the space on the shelf when supermarkets are sued on television, microwaves, and household products.
According to Seinsbury, the number of cosmetic products is twice as high as 3,000.
Even existing products such as L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burn's Bees can take more space with brand space like you see at Bots.
The store is renovating the Boutic Zone, and it responds to young people's wishes and uses most of its products for Beigan.
And the perfumer's flagrans shop will be divided into two stores in Seinsbury.
Because of online shopping and the tendency to buy small amounts of food in local convenience stores, supermarkets have to work to attract customers.
According to Seinsbury CEO Mike Koupe, the store becomes a department store as the supermarket chain provides more services to reduce food consumption and counters the discounts Aldi and Lidl:
Seinsbury has put Argos' shop in hundreds of stores since two years ago, which strengthened the sale of food and increased the profits of buying.
The last supermarket attempt to renovate a beauty shop and a pharmacy failed.
Seinsbury worked with Bots in the early 2000s.
Three years ago, Seinsbury sold 281 stores for £25 million in the Ceresio, the owner of the Lryds Palmy chain.
This was also involved in Lloyds, who introduced skin-care brands like La Roche-Posoy and Vichi in four stores.
Paul Mill Hicks, a commercial director of Seinsbury, says:
I'm investing in a specially trained colleague who's going to give me advice again.
Our brands respond to every need and show new beauty businesses to their attractive surroundings and convenient estates.
And when Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million-pound deal, Peter Joes was furious.
Star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, was "excused" for leaving Peter's 11 million pounds of business with his lifestyle brand business, focusing on his new contract with Holly Willowby.
Willowby cannot spend time with household items and accessories "Truly".
Their business was likened to Guwines Partlow's Goop brand.
This morning, Willowby reported leaving the business at Instagram.
Holly Willowby threw away Peter Jones of Dragons Den by retreating from their advantage of lifestyle brand business at the time of the gulli, to focus on a new big deal with Marks, Spencer, and ITV.
On Thursday, the Golden Girls show revealed that it was impossible to spend time at home, accessory brand "Truly" with her 1.5 million pounds of new contracts.
The business was compared to Guwines Partlow's Goop brand, which doubled Wylowby's estimated assets of 11 million.
When Willowby reported leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones left England and headed for one of the jets.
The source said, "Truly has the highest priority so far for Holly.
It's going to be a long-term event that we've seen for decades.
Everyone was amazed at the decision to retreat.
No one can believe what happened on Thursday, it was right up to the release.
Marlowe has a warehouse full of products ready to sell.
According to experts, millions of dollars are spent on large investments and the possibility of further delays in the production of such products as cushions, candles, clothing, and household items from Britain’s most trusted star Willoughby.
This means the end of a long friend.
My three-year-old mother, Willowby, and my husband, Dan Baldwin, had been in love with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for 10 years.
Willowby launched Cap and Truly in 2016, and Jones participated as president in March.
They're also on holiday, and Jones is investing 40 percent of the total in Baldwin's TV production.
Willowby is going to be an M&S sign, and on behalf of Ant McPartlin, I'm going to be I'm going to be a Celebrity.
Last night, information close to Jones said, "No comment on his business."
"I fell in love with him."
He joked about the media's criticism of being too optimistic about the North Korean leaders that the comments were supposed to be "unpublic".
Why did President Trump give up?
The president said the news anchor was false.
I'm not giving up on anything.
President Kim Jong-un said Kim Jong-un was willing to attend the second meeting in Singapore in June after the first meeting praised by the President as a great step forward to denuclearizing North Korea.
But the non-nuclear negotiations are dead.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Shibuya, addressed world leaders on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
Instead, he said the United States continues to enforce sanctions to impose pressure.
The card was far more optimistic in Larry's speech.
He's doing well with North Korea.
"I used to plan a war with North Korea.
Millions of people will die.
Now it is a wonderful relationship."
Trump says efforts to improve the relationship with North Korea have brought good results, including the end of missile experiments, the release of innocent hostages, and the conversion of the bodies of American soldiers.
And when we talked about our relationship with Kim Jong-un, we used an odd metaphor.
"It's easy to be president," Trump said, pointing directly to the 200 people in front of them, "and now instead of calling 10,000 people outside to pack them into a crowded room,
A tsunami and earthquake hit Indonesia, killing hundreds of people.
It's the aftermath of the Ronbok earthquake.
Even though more than 10 percent of the island's population has been torn apart, no national disaster has been declared necessary to demand international aid.
"We have made it clear, unfortunately, that we do not seek international assistance.
"Save the Children" is preparing for Par, but it's still not clear if foreign staff can work there.
Spock, a spokesman for the state disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities are deciding whether to allow the international authorities to help with the situation.
In view of the constant earthquake in Indonesia, the country is desperately not prepared for the anger of nature.
There's a tsunami shelter in Ache, but there aren't many other coastlines.
The pal clearly has fewer tsunami sirens, and with the sirens, it can save more lives.
Even when it’s the best time to go to Indonesia, it’s a very liski.
Natural disasters have made the current even more complicated.
The rescue ships that were stationed at Loon me to carry the people of the earthquake are on their way to Par, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widdo has put money into roads and railways as the focus of the election campaign to improve Indonesia's fragile infrastructure.
But next year's reelection and lack of funds have plagued Joko's regime.
President Joko is under pressure from prolonged tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims are more conservative.
More than a thousand people died and tens of thousands are separated from their homes.
I'm sure you'll find Daniel Starridge in Liverpool, and I'm sure you'll find a way to get deep into the Icolyser Vs Chelsea.
Daniel Starridge defeated Liverpool in the Premium League on Saturday, and won in 89 minutes on the Stanford Bridge in London.
When Starridge received a pass from Sheldon Shakili, it was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, and his team was at 1-0.
He taps the ball to the left and shoots it to the Farpost.
The ball went up and down and fell into the net in the upper right.
The ball is a goal for the jumper, Kepa Alyzabaraga.
"I've only been in my position to get the ball, since a player like Sack is as fast as I can, and I'm just trying to play myself while there's time."
"I saw kate coming. I touched it a little, I didn't think too much, I just shot."
In 25 minutes, Chelsea has taken a point from the Belgian star Eden Hazard and is leading it at half-time at 1-0.
Bruce's striker blocked the path to Matteo Kovachic in the match, ran around Midfield, headed for Liverpool.
Kovach made a quick Gibb and Go in Midfield.
There he sent out a beautiful smooth path and pushed towards the goal.
He broke through the difar, reached the Farpostnet, and hit him with his left foot across Allison Becker in Liverpool.
On Wednesday at Stadio San.Paoro in Naples, Italy, Liverpool fought Naples at 3:00 p.m. in a group stage of the Champions League.
In London on Thursday, Chelsea fights the video to the UEFA European League at 3:00 p.m.
There are 832 deaths in the Indonesian tsunami.
The country's disaster authorities reported early Sunday that 832 people died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Stopo Pulva Nugrojo, a newsman for the agency, reported that many people were trapped in the rubble of a building that was destroyed by a 7.5-millimeter earthquake on Friday, and that there were waves up to 20 feet high.
In Par, where there are 380,000 people, fragments of the building are scattered.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for the murder of a woman.
A female body was found and investigated this morning at Birkenhead on Margeside.
A 44-year-old man with a stab wound at Grayson Muss on John Street was found at 7:55 a.m. and was arrested by a 32-year-old man.
The police are calling on locals to provide information.
Detective Brian O'Hagan says, "The investigation started early, but it's called for information to be provided to a person in Birkenhead on the side of the merger.
I'm asking a cab driver in particular, because there may be video of the investigation being recorded in a dash.
Police spokesman confirmed that the body of a woman was found in the Birkenhead area and died inside.
A friend who knows a woman arrived at the scene this morning to hear a story about where she was found.
Police are trying to inform the victim's neighbors, and the investigation is under way.
When a taxi driver in Grayson Mus is trying to get back into his building, he says he cannot get inside the building from the police.
When he understood what happened, he didn't say a word.
Now it was said that the tenants would not be allowed inside until a few hours.
I heard the cops were treating the whole city as a murder scene.
A woman showed up at the scene crying.
He kept saying, "It's awful."
At 2 p.m., there was a police car on two ropes, and the other one was just outside.
Some of the cops were on the rope, watching the building block.

The Klomwell statue of the House of Parliament will be the latest monument to the "History Revived."
The expulsion was poetic justice against the destruction of many British cultural and religious arts by the fanatic Puritans like the Taliban.
Mr. Click said the Cromwell Society was "foolish and trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, says: "The object of Oliver Cromwell's statue outside the Palace of Westminster was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of images.
The symbol of the British civil war was not given to Cromwell or carried out.
Perhaps a different Cromwell was sacrificed by the actions of his ancestors in the previous century.
The magnificent expression of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Sonecroft is evidence of 19th century belief, and part of the history of a man who believes that many are still worthy of celebrating.
"Clomwell was the champion of the parliament against external pressure to many people in the latter part of the 19th century, more than today, and of course, he is the monarchy."
It's the subject of a ongoing debate on whether it's a perfectly correct expression.
It's true that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the development of the country after it.
His work as a protector is also a celebration, a memorial."
Morth of the killer pig kills the Chinese farmer.
According to local media, farmers were attacked and killed by pigs in the south-west markets of China.
The only man known by the name “Yuan” was found bleeding around a pighouse with an artery cut in the Ministry's six water market.
On May 30, 2005, at a pig farm in West China, pig farmers were immunizing pigs.
He said he was moving with his cousin on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market next door to Cloudnan.
The next morning, my cousin found him dead and found the door to the pig shed next to him.
I heard there was a big male pig with a big, bloody mouth in the hut.
According to reports, a forensic examination confirmed that 550 pounds of pigs killed farmers.
"My cousin's feet were covered in blood," said a cousin named "U" according to Guyyan Evining News:
The security cameras showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 Thursday afternoon to feed a pig.
The body had been dead for an hour.
The pig that killed him wasn't Yuan's or my cousin's.
The market manager told Evining News that the pigs were isolated from anyone and the police were collecting evidence:
Yuan's family and market manager are supposed to be negotiating compensation for his death.
It's rare, but there's an example of a pig attacking a human.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband on a Massachusetts farm in 2016 and seriously injured her husband.
Ten years ago, a 200-pound pig trapped a Wales farmer in a truck, and his wife got rid of the animals.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, one farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can become a trigger.
"I'm just playing."
He's a kid, he's curious, he doesn't mean he's hunting.
He says, "I just have to be honest and be right."
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, the hurricane has weakened as it passes through cold waters north of the Gulf of Mexico.
But Rosa will continue to see flooding rain in North Mexico and the southwestern United States for the next few days.
In the middle of the night, the wind of Lota, at 5 a.m., was 85 miles per hour, the one-level hurricane of category.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
On the other hand, new trafs are born in the Pacific, moving east toward the west coast of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa brought 10 inches of rain to Mexico.
And as the humidity of the tropics and the approaching traf, in the next few days, there will be widespread rainfall in the Southwest.
In rural areas, one-and-a-half inch of rain could be dangerous to flood, mud, and landslides.
A lot of tropical humidity, especially in parts of Arizona and southern Nevada, increases rainfall from 2 to 3 inches per hour.
It's raining from two to four inches in part of the southwest, especially in many parts of Arizona.
Because of the nature of the tropical rain, the flood may strike, and the situation may worsen rapidly.
So walking through the desert on foot in the rain is extremely dangerous.
The heavy rains threaten to turn the valley into a river, and there will be lightning and strong winds, and dust will be blown away.
The approaching trafs are part of the southern California coastline, bringing local heavy rain.
This could result in a total of more than half an inch of rain.
This will be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Late Sundays and early Mondays, a sudden tropical rain is approaching Arizona, and rain is expected to spread on Mondays and Tuesdays.
The heavy rain is expected to spread widely on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
In October, temperatures are rapidly changing across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic Circle, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
So, if you look at this, you'll see that there's a huge change in temperature between.
There's an example of a dramatic temperature difference in central America on Sunday.
There's almost 20 degrees temperature difference between St. Louis, Nebraska, and Des Moines in Kansas City, Missouri.
In the days ahead, the heat of summer will continue to grow.
When 80 degrees is extended from the southern plain to the part of the northeast, many of the central and eastern parts of the United States expect to be warmer in October.
On Tuesday, New York could reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term weather forecast predicts that by the beginning of October, temperatures in the eastern United States will often exceed average.
More than 20 million people will listen to Bret Kavaneau.
More than 20 million people saw Bresey Ford on Thursday, the testimony of the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavaneau and a woman who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, on Friday's last day, the station interrupted a regular program and continued its political support for an agreement designed by Senator Arizonan Jeff Freke to conduct a week's investigation against the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100% convinced Kavaneau was drunk and was trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanu testified . . . . . .
On Friday, more than 20.4 million people seem to have seen it.
The average of their viewers at this time was CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Chanel, MSNBC.
Other company figures such as PBS, C-SPAN, Fox Business Network were not available immediately.
Nielsen always sees in his office a problem with how to scale.
In the general sense, it's the same number as football and academy awards.
Fox News Chanel says that Niel received an average of 59.6 million viewers in a daily hearing because of a host whose opinion is in support of the Kavaneau's appointment:
ABC was second only to 3.6 million viewers.
According to Neilsen, CBS is 3.1 million, NBC is 244 million, MSNBC is 2.8 million, CNN is 25.2 million.
We've been talking about it since we were hearing it.
Freck was the star of Friday.
On Friday morning, he was surrounded by CNN and CBS reporters and shouted:
He was standing with his eyes closed in the middle of a live CNN broadcast, while he was beheaded.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He was also told, "You have power because women are not strong."
According to Fred, his office issued a statement saying that before the elevator closed, more should be said at the committee hearings.
A few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee has decided to vote for Kavano, all the senators will begin broadcasting live.
But he said he would only do so with the knowledge that the FBI will investigate the case against next week's candidates, as a few Democrats claim.
He had some confidence in a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Cohns and the other senators, he made a decision.
Freke's choice was powerful, because without the investigation, Republicans were clearly unable to vote for Kavanu.
President card has the FBI investigate the charges against the Kavanau.
British Prime Minister May blames the criticism that he's playing politics over the Bregzit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May denounced the criticism that she is using the future of Britain to “take advantage of politics” in a program to leave the EU.
British Prime Minister Teresa May attends a conservative party meeting in Bamingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
On the other hand, her former minister, Borris Johnson, who appeared on the cover of the newspaper, highlighted his attack on the so-called checkers plan as “very good” for the British and EU to collect customs between themselves.
Police arrested Datheon Cympson for the death of an LSU player who was hit by Wade Simms.
Police arrested a 20-year-old Los Angeles basketball player, Wade Sims, who was shot and killed.
Baton Rouge P.D. said he was arrested for the second murder, 20 years old.
The authorities released the video, showing Sims and Simpson fighting, and the police pointed out that Sims had lost his glasses on the way.
A CBS WAFB reported that police found glasses on the scene, and that there was a sinkson's DNA.
The police said that after hearing about what happened to the Simpsons, they admitted he shot Wade dead and killed him.
It was reported that he was going to pay $350,000.
On Friday, the Bishop of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a head-to-head gunshot wound.
The agency thanked the Louisiana State Police Forces, the National Police Institute of Crimes, and the cooperation of the South University police and local citizens:
Joe Areva, the LSU Astrotic Director, thanked the local law enforcement agency for "dependence and the pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20.
He grew up in Baton Rouge and his father Wayne played basketball in LSU.
So, here's another example.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, a coach for LSU, reported that Wade's death had destroyed his team and was devastated.
"I've been afraid, Wade says.
A volcanic eruption in Mexico City.
Ash from Popocatepetl volcano has reached the south side of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Center warned them to leave the volcano on Saturday and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions from the volcano in 24 hours.
The center was watching the shaking and shaking.
Image on social media shows images of the ashes covering car windshields in the vicinity of Mexico City, like Sochimirco.
Geologists have confirmed that since September 2017, the 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico had increased the activity of the volcano at 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Stand by for the Day of Independence, the Catalan Separatists and the police clash.
Six people were arrested on Saturday after a pro-separate party clash with the police in Barcelona, and thousands took part in a protest against the Catalonia vote.
When a group of pro-separates, who hide their faces, were pushed by a moving force, they threw eggs and powders of paint at them, and created a dark cloud of clouds on the streets that are usually tourists.
Scaffles also used their guards to work with the police on that day to end the fighting.
For a few hours, a group of pro-democracy stood up against the Allies, shouting, "Forget it, Spain, forever."
According to the local newspaper, 14 people are being treated by protesters for light treatment.
While considered illegal by Madrid, tensions are increasing in the independent-minded region a year after the October 1 vote that was blessed by the Separatist Catalonias.
Overwhelmingly many voting for independence, the opposition was low because of boycotting.
According to Catalonia authorities, police tried to stop the elections in the polls, where about a thousand people were injured.
The pro-democracy group spent the night on Fridays camping to stop the demonstrations from being supported by the National Police.
We've moved on, but we've been forced to go on another path.
My wife and Separatists, Narsis Termes, 68 years old, say they no longer have any hope in Catalonia:
"This year was a great opportunity.
I saw my parents vote, and I cried with joy, but now I’m stuck."
Despite the slightest victory in the regional elections last December, the independent party in Catalonia is still struggling to get a boost this year for its own asylum and leaders in detention to decide on their role in organizing the vote and then on the draft of the Declaration of Independence.
The 42-year-old Mechanic, Joan Puig, who was recording the protests on the phone for the police, said that the conflict was growing by two politicians:
"It's getting more and more tense," he says.
Orior Funkelas, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced on Sunday that he will run for the European parliament next year.
“ running for the European elections is the best way to condemn the neglect and oppression we received from the Spanish government,” he says.
The men who got arrested when the London Belly car crashed into their house.
Three men, 33, 34, 39, were arrested while clashing with Londonbury homes.
The incident took place on Thursday at around 19:30 p.m. at Barrynaguard Crescent.
Det Insec Bob Bremings said the gate and the building itself were damaged:
Looks like a crossbow was fired from the car.
In Menga's strike, Livingstone won the Rangers 1-0.
The first goal of Dolly Menga was to ensure the victory of Rivingston.
The rangers were amazed that Livingstone gave Steve Gerard the second defeat in 18 fights.
Since Gary Holt's side has leveled with the second Hiberian, the attack on Dory Menga has proved to be different.
The side of Gerrard will remain this season's premeditation without the Away victory and will face the leader's Hertz, who will be traveling at eight points next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers on Thursday will host the European League of Rapidween.
In the meantime, Livingstone expands their undefeated series of departments to six games, since head coach Holt hasn't yet experienced defeat.
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
So, if we were to do that, we would have been ahead of the Holt team long before we were to score, and that directness caused the Jones to have all kinds of problems.
Skot Robinson broke through, but he dragged his efforts towards the goal, and then Alan Lesgour could only direct extensive efforts after those slides to fill the Harding of Craig Hallet beyond the goal.
The host was happy to let the runner play in front of him.
And that's how the key goals were achieved.
Rangers recognized the kicks, and Rivingston set up the Menga in combination with Ounging, Declangar, Robinson.
By that stage, the Rangers had taken control of their property, but they couldn't pass through the homey fence, and the goalkeeper Lim Kerry was hardly disturbed.
Alfredo Morelos forced a safe from Kelly, but the pattern went on for the second time.
Scott Pittman was denied when he saw the goalkeepers of the Rangers and the squirrels' feet spread out from another Livingstone set.
And so, in the first video, we saw that, while Cyrus came into the Liveston box and was still cleared, Harket replaced Glenn Midlett, and the two Penaltems for the handballs were rejected.
Analyzing Rivingston's phenomenon.
Tony Macaronia, Alas de Almont, BBC Scotland
The extraordinary performance and results of the Rivingston project.
They were good for men, and they were beyond expectations of this upward trend.
But he's got to go to Holt because of the way he's fed his team with electricity.
He had a lot of heroes.
While Mengha took a close look at Conor Goldson and Joe Worall, Captain Harket had a great organized defense.
The Rangers, but lack inspiration.
They were just as good as they were sometimes under Gerards, and they didn't cover their standards enough.
It was only once that they opened the home side and it was like a call to wake up for the Rangers.
A mixed reception in Eldon, Cologne.
On Saturday, Turkish and German leaders gathered for breakfast in Berlin, so there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day that Eldon visited Germany, and it aims to restore relations between NATO’s allies.
They discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of press, and Turkey's EU membership.
Elvern then went to open up a huge new mosque in Cologne.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police gave security reasons to stop more than 25,000 strong crowds from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were found to be close to meeting their president.
Hundreds of Erdoan protesters (many of them Kurdish) also heard their voices and condemned the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protests of conflict reflect the disagreement between visitors welcomed by some German Turks as heroes and those criticized by others as dictators.
Deptford Road Conflict: Car collision killed bike driver.
A bike driver who was caught in a car crash in London died.
The crash took place at 10:15 in the vicinity of Westwood and Evelyn Street, a road with a high traffic rate in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the scene.
A month later, another bike driver died in a hit-and-run on Charilder Street, about a mile away from the Saturday crash.
Metropolitan police say the police are encouraging identification of men and reporting to relatives.
Roads are closed and bus bypasses are being conducted, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Longratin prison: Six guards injured in a riot.
The guards said that six guards were injured in a riot in a heavily guarded man's prison.
There's still a riot going on at Oostershire's HMP Longratin, British time Sunday, around 09:30.
The professional "Tornado" guards were called to deal with the disturbances in the wing area of eight inmates.
The cops were treated at the scene with a slight injury to their faces.
Prison representative said: "A specially trained guard was stationed to handle the HMP Longratin incident.
Six staff members were treated for their injuries.
Those of us who do not allow violence in prison and are held accountable will be mentioned by the police and will spend longer hours in prison."
HMP Longratin has more than 500 prisoners in the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the warden was reported to have been attacked by a prisoner and treated in a hospital.
And last October they were sent to prison to deal with a serious disturbance where staff was attacked at a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa flash flood in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (may benefit the drought zone)
It is rare for tropical low pressure to occur in Arizona, but there is a very high chance that a flash flood will occur at the beginning of next week due to hurricane energy in hurricanes across the southwest desert.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flash flood warning on Mondays and Tuesdays from Phoenix, Flagmen, Las Vegas, and from west Arizona, including Salt Lake City, South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah.
Rosa will be approached with rain late Monday and will be told to hit Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said on Twitter: "Since 1950, there have been only 10 low-pressure tropical storms and low pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of AZ border.
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts two to four inches of rain, and in Arizona’s Mogolons, it will be up to six inches of rain.
The rest of the Southwest desert, including the Central Rocky and the Great Basson, could be between 1 and 2 inches and a rare maximum of 4 inches.
Rosa's rain could be a blessing for those who don't risk flash water.
It's a very serious problem, but because the Southwest is in a drought, some rain could be beneficial.
According to the United States, more than 40 percent of Arizona is in the ultimate drought, and it is in the second highest category, ” reported a drought monitor by Weather.com.
First of all, Hurricane Roza's path leads to landing across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa's strength is 85 miles per Sunday morning at 385 miles south of Punta Yuzinia, Mexico, and 12 miles per hour.
The storm hits the cold water of the Pacific, and it's losing its grip.
That's why it's predicted that Monday afternoon, or at night, a tropical storm will land in Mexico.
There's a lot of rain in Mexico, and there's a huge flood risk.
"A total rain of 3 to 6 inches, up to 10 inches will be expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora," reported Weather.com.
We're going to see Rosa going north across Mexico as a tropical storm before she gets near the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, and through Arizona by midnight on Tuesday to the south of Utah.
The National Hurricane Center said that the main threat to Rosa and her impact is the very heavy rain in Baja California, northern Sonola, and the United States.
It is predicted that this rain will cause life-threatening flash floods, earthslides in the desert, and landslides in the mountains.
Mid-Samernton Attak: We arrested four men for attempted murder.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after they were found stabbed to death at the age of 16.
A teenage boy was found injured in Excelcior Terrace in Mid-Sammer-Nutt. around 0400:00 BST on Saturday.
He's in a stable state.
Somerset police said that 17-year-olds, 2-year-olds, 18-year-olds, and 20-year-olds were arrested overnight in Radd Stock in Avon.
The police are waiting for someone to come forward with a cell phone video of what happened.
The card says Kabanu is suffering from the democracy's despicableness and anger.
"The vote of Judge Cavano is a vote against the harsh and evil of the Democrats."
The card described the Democrats' "inflict and angry" career and their appointments.
Cavano testified in front of the parliament Thursday, and strongly denied her claim that they had sexually assaulted Christine Brown when they were teenagers a few decades ago.
Feed also testified to her claim in the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said, "The American people saw the beauty, the character, and the courage of the Kabanu that day."
"The vote approved by Judge Cavano is one of the most sophisticated legal spirits of our time, a vote approved by legal experts with impressive records of public affairs."
When the president was talking about the importance of Republicans in the mid-term elections, he went a long way and referred to Kabanu's recommendation:
"It's been five weeks until one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running around.
"That's why I'm everywhere to fight for the great candidates."
The card argued that it was a mission for Democrats to "resiste or interfere."
When the first key procedural vote in the Senate in Cavano's appointment was held by Friday, GOP's assistant in charge told CNN:
Hundreds of people were killed and more were killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people died, many were washed away, said the authorities on Saturday, as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, and the waves surged to the beach.
Hundreds of people were gathered on Friday at the beach of Parth.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were killed because they were active at the beach and did not run away immediately.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it drove, it dragged cars, wood, houses, it hit all over land." "Nogrojo said the tsunami came around at the speed of 800 kp (497 mph) before it hit the shore," he added.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and he said:
About 16,700 people have taken refuge at the 24 center of Par.
Aerial photos released by the Department of Disasters showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges torn down, and mosques surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued in coastal cities.
I could feel a series of earthquakes in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Rating Technology Application (BPT) has declared that the energy released in a big earthquake on Friday was about 200 times as powerful as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II:
He said the scale of the tsunami could have been increased on the city's geography at the edge of a long narrow bay.
Nugrojo described the damage as "wide" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Some of the victims were found in the rubble of a destroyed building, and he said 540 people were injured and 29 were reported missing.
Nugrojo said the casualties and damage were worse than the 300 km north of Par, near Dongara, near the source of the quake.
"The information from Dongara was completely out of communication," Nagrobo said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, and added that they are headed for areas affected by staff and volunteers.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Officials say the waves came during the alert, but on Saturday they were widely criticized for not knowing that the tsunami had struck Par:
In the amateur video shared on social media, I heard a man on the top of a building screaming at the approach of tsunamis, desperate for people on the road below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, and the building and the car were swept away.
Reuter couldn't authenticate the footage immediately.
It's difficult for the authorities to work together as an earthquake and tsunami have gone out of power and communications around Par.
The army is carrying supplies from Jakarta and other cities on cargo planes, but the refugees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airports are resuming only for relief efforts, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widdo is scheduled to visit Par's evacuation center on Sunday.
There are more than 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
It's terrible.
Doseva said that the world vision staff in Dongara were safe in the city of Par, which is taking refuge in a water supply shelter set up by employees in an office yard.
"I'm sorry," he said. "I'm sorry."
It's terrible.
While relief organizations have begun to launch relief efforts, some have claimed that the journey to Par has been blocked by deep expertise.
According to Indonesia regulations, funds and resources from overseas will only begin to be distributed when disaster sites are declared a disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a state-level disaster, and Aria Ariani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross, said:
"One time the government says, 'I understand this is a disaster in the country.'"
On Friday night in Parr, after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family who were still missing hoped that the people they loved would be a miracle of the tragic stories of natural disasters.
The boy was dragged out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuer rescued a woman trapped under the rubble beside her mother's body beside her mother.
Gendon Svanno, a coach for Indonesia’s National Para-Linging Team, trained two missing paraglinders at the first Asian convention in Indonesia this month.
Besides those who were locked up in the Loroa Hotel, including Mandagi, his students were there.
"I have my own emotional burden as a cinia in the region of paragrating."
Gendon traveled among the Paragrying community several hours after the collapse of the Roague Hotel and told of his desperate wish to send a WatsAp message to a competition company in Par, where he was participating in the beach festival:
His message was only a gray check mark instead of a blue check mark.
"I think it means that the message didn't come."
A thief in Levey's Newport robbed $26,755 while supplementing an ATM.
According to a news release from the police station in Newport, the thieves stole $226,7550 while Breck employees were supplementing their new port at Levy's ATM.
The car driver was preparing to empty out the ATM of the entertainment complex and deliver more money.
While he was working, another man came running behind an employee of Blink and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
According to the release, the witness saw more than one suspect running away from the scene, but the police did not identify the number of people involved in the incident.
If you have any information on their identity, please contact Newport Police 859-292-3680.

The trumpeter, the West, will change his name to Yee.
When he announced his change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "What is officially known as Canie West."
The 41-year-old West was sometimes nicknamed Ye, and it was also used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change will take place before the arrival of Yandhi's new album on Saturday night live, which will be expected to be released.
The creator of the show said he was going to show up instead of Ariana Grande, who canceled for "Encyclopædia":
Like his current professional name, West said in the past that the word had religious significance for him.
"I believe "Y" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you."
"So I'm with you, and I'm with us, and it's with us."
It starts with the one word meaning only, and becomes a reflection of our good and evil, of all our confusion.
The album reflects more of who we are.
He's one of the many famous rappers who change their names.
Sean Comms, known by various people as P.D., P.ditty, or Dedi, announced his choice this year by the name Love And Brother Love:
JAY-Z, the former West Collaborater, also used to make hyphens or capitals.
Mexico's AMLO swears to use military forces against its citizens.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obladl, elected president of Mexico, vowed never to use military force against ordinary citizens by the state to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the vengeance of blood on students:
Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use his military force to take over the Mexican people on Saturday at Tratero-Praza.
On October 2, 1968, when the leftist student movement was based in Latin America, an army shot at a peaceful protest in Plaza, killing 300 people at the time.
Lopez Obladl has promised students a monthly grant, a free college release, and a promise to support the youth of Mexico.
He said young people are running to criminal gangs because of unemployment and lack of education.
The U.S. should double its A.I. financial support.
As China is more aggressive in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an AI businessman who works at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
While the United States as a whole lacks the AI strategy, the comment was made after the AI notice was issued in various departments of the US government.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: to be the best in AI innovation by 2030.
Double the AI research budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are much slower than the United States, and Lee said we want to take the next step in the AI:
The doubling of the funds will also double the chances of the next major achievement in US AI, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC:
The book AI Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houton Miphlin Harbat, invested in Face++, China's most famous AI company.
In the 1980s, he created an AI system at Carnegie Mellon where he defeated the American top Otero player, and then he became an Executive for Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
Lee came to the conclusion that he agreed to past U.S. government technical conventions, such as the Robotics Challenge at the Department of Defense Research and Research, and what time will it be?
American researchers work hard to get government subsidized, Lee said:
"China's not taking academic leadership, it's cooperation," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently hired leaders from universities studying AI.
Lee said the change in immigration policy would also help strengthen the US's approach to AI:
"I think PHD should be given a green card automatically in the AI field.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Department issued its next generation of artificial intelligence projects.
While the National Science Foundation of China provides funds to the academic community in a way similar to the State Science Foundation and other government agencies paying US researchers, Lee said China's academic research is low:
At the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Defense in the United States established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to join partners in business and academic studies, and the White House has announced the installation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
And now the DARPA announced that 2 billion dollars of investment will be put into an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is now spending over 100 million dollars a year on AI research.
On the other hand, US regulations to establish a national security committee with artificial intelligence have not been seen for months.
Macedonians are going to change the name of their country and vote for it.
The Macedonians are trying to resolve a decade-long dispute between the European Union and NATO, which has either changed the country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia" on Sunday.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, claimed that the people of the North claimed their territory and voted to join NATO and EU.
The government signed an agreement based on a new name proposed in June, but anti-nationalists argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the main Slav population in Macedonia.
President Georgi Iwanov does not vote for the vote, and the boycott campaign is questioning whether the vote rate will meet at least 50 percent of the votes that are valid.
Read the question about the vote: "Do you agree to accept the agreement with Greece and become a member of the NATO and EU?"
Supporters of a change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth joining institutions like the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country today, so they will be free to live under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us."
We don't have the legal restraints, but enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the results of the vote for the decision.
Change of name will require two-thirds of Congress.
The week's electoral committee said there was no report of fraud by 1:00 p.m.
However, compared to 34 percent of the last polls in 2016, 66 percent of registered voters voted, the vote rate remained only 16 percent.
"I came to vote for my children, our location is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje, aged 62.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zorran Zaev, his wife and son, Dasco, took part in a Macedonian poll on September 30, 2018, about a change in the name of a country that would open the way for NATO and the European Union in St.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardrakov, 54, prepared a small stage and pulled a chair in front of a tent set up by those boycotting the voters.
"We agree with NATO and the EU, but we want to participate, not through a service door, but with caution."
"We are a poor country, but dignified.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, they can be part of European Asia integration by other countries like China and Russia."
The Prime Minister has said that NATO membership will provide the investment needed for Macedonia with a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that more than 80 percent of the people support the EU and NATO and that the majority support it," Zayev said after voting.
He said the result of "yes" would be "a proof of our future."
According to the Macedonian Policy Research Institute, last Monday, the polls published below the required vote rate by 30 to 43 percent of voters who said they would participate in the polls.
In another public opinion, by Thelma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the respondents said they were going to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote for it.
For a vote to succeed, you need 50 percent and one vote.
The failure of the vote will be the first serious blow to the Western party government since last May.

Serhio Agulo and Rahem Stirling won a 2-0 victory in Manchester City on Sunday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
After 65 minutes, Aguero made the score foolishly easy.
Argentin's striker got a pass in Midfield at the beginning of a series.
He competed with three DiFenders in Brighton before leaving the open field.
Agero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed away a Diferder and shook more people at the end of the Brighton Box.
And he found Starling and gave him a pass to his left.
The English FW returned the ball to Aguero with its first touch in the box and used its right boots to beat thekeeper, Matthew Ryan, and put a shot on the right side of the net.
"Agulo was struggling with foot problems."
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he decided to score at that moment."
But it was starling that gave Skybrew the first offer in the Premium League fight.
That goal took place in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton in that match.
He sent a beautiful smooth path along the left side to Leroy Sanne.
He kicked Starling a few times before he sent him to the Farpost.
SkyBlue forward pushed the ball online just before it slipped into the border.
At Rhine Necker Alena in Zinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday afternoon at 12:55 p.m., the city faces Huffenheim.
Shazard wants to play with Spokane.
Nationals has been removed from playoffs, so there is little reason to start.
But the battled Shazer wants the Coloradocs to take a mound on Sunday, but only if the Lokkeys, who lead Los Angeles on the west side of the NL, still have a playoff.
Rockys wins the Nationals on Friday night, winning at least 5-2, but wants to ensure the first district win.
"We can throw at least, even if we're playing for no reason, and the crowd here in Denver is probably the highest level of play at any time that the rest of the team is facing this year.
"How could you not want to fight like that?"
Nationals hasn't released their Sunday Star yet, but they report that Shaza will be picked up in such circumstances.
Shazar is going to start his 34th day, he's going to throw it at the Burpen season on Thursday, and he's going to throw it at the usual Sunday break.
This season, 220 right-handers in Washington, two-thirds of an E.RA., 18-7 in a three-thirds-one-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two
The cards are a big rally in West Virginia.
When the president was talking about the importance of Republicans in the midterm, he went a long way and referred to the situation in which the Supreme Court has chosen Bret Kabaneau.
"Everything we've done takes place in November.
"It's been five weeks until one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big--I don't run, but I run around, so I'm everywhere to fight for the great candidates.
The cards continued, "Look at this terrible Democratic extremist group and you'll see what's happening right now.
And they will see that it's vulgar and offensive that they decide to use any means necessary to restore power.
They don't care who they're hurting themselves to get power and control, because that's what they want, and we don't give them it."
He said the Democrats are missioned to "resiste or interfere."
"and you'll see it for the last four days."
He took on the Senate Judicial Committee to rank the Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein, and received a huge round of applause from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did the papers leak?
Oh, yeah, what is it?
No, no, no, no, no, I'm really bad body language--waiting for the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labor Party is no longer a large church.
I can't stand the people who speak my mind.
When my local party Momentam activist voted to evacuate me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I'm at the front row of the supposedly unrecognizable labor party MPs - all of them speak spirit.
Joan Ryan, a colleague of the parliament, was treated similarly because she stood strong for anti-Semitism:
In my case, the accusation took place by not agreeing with Jeremy Colvin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, and even in Europe, it was ironic that Jeremy did not agree with his former leader.
On Friday at the Nothingham East Labor Party meeting, he said, "We want to make the meeting comprehensive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labor Party MP, Friday night GC was just like that.
Sadly, there has long been a promise of a policy that is "kinder and kinder" if it does not have many tones of meeting today or actually started.
It is gradually becoming clear that different views are not acceptable in the Labor Party, and that all opinions are acceptable to the party leaders.
This started right after Jeremy became a leader, and my colleagues, whom I thought had shared similar political views, began to wish I could turn around and take the place I had never seen before, or agree on national security or on a single market in the EU.
Whenever I publicly announced, there was a series of harassments on social media, such as demanding that I speak of less importance – and calling for the removal of elections and the centre’s policy criticism – I said I shouldn’t be part of the labor party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, my comments tend to be political, so I think I'm better off than some of my colleagues.
I am awed by the professionality and determination of my colleagues, who face a daily spiral of sexism and racism, but never shy.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how much abuse has become normal.
Last week Jeremy Colvin argued that the Labor Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
It is true that we are no longer a large church.
Over the past two years, I have tried to be humble, not too loud, and I have given a lot of advice to make it all work.
But we didn't go into politics to do that.
Ever since I joined the Labor Party as a student 32 years ago, I have been inspired by the neglect of the Satcher government, which literally destroyed my general school classroom.
I have never hidden my policies, including the last election.
Nobody was confused in the Nottingham East about my policy and the areas where I disagree with my current leader.
For those who have promoted the movement on Friday, what I can say is that the country is struggling with the Bregjits that damage family, business and our public services, and I do not understand my desire to waste my energy on time and my loyalty to the Labor Party leader.
But my message is not against Momentam in Nottingham, but to those who support me: I am proud to work for you, and I promise that I will not prevail against my actions from my belief that the threat or political advantage is the best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP for the Nottingham East.
Air 38-17 Melrose:
If the final outcome of the two late trials has changed somewhat, the air today is definitely worth winning in this very Entrepremational Premation Match.
Now they're at the top of the table, only 10 undefeated sides.
Finally, by having a better chance with a better fence, the coach Peter Murchi has every welcome right to travel to the home side.
"We have been tested through the games, and we are still undefeated and should be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Trust in the Air; they got better opportunities than we do."
The 14th minute test of Grant Anderson, instead of Frager Crimo, pushed the air forward, and the game was launched by Wally Hughes, who gave Melrose numbers, and Jason Bagoat took the unconfirmed trial.
Klimo took a break at 17-5 in the air, extending the air's lead with the Penalty just before half-time.
But Melrose went into the latter, and Patrick Anderson's try from Baggot was reduced to five points.
Then he waited a long time for L'Arid Nott, who was put on a badly injured stretcher, and after the resumption, air went further by the Stafford McDwall test.
Captain Blair McPherson received the yellow card, and once again Melrose paid off Bruce Colvin's extra player at the end of the spell of intense pressure.
However, the home side came back, and Staruan hutton got a yellow card without a ball, and landed behind the air mall that McPherson was moving forward from the Penaltium out.
After Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kicks, Crimmo almost re-started, and he sent Frankie's Gregor Henry to the fifth trial on the platform.
The Styll Game Star has a new career in the restaurant industry.
Stir game star Ford Kieran, after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company, seems to be ready to move to the Hospity industry.
Jack Jarvis, 56 years old, wrote and played with Greg Hemphill, a long-time comedian, on a popular BBC show.
That Duo announced that the nineth series would be one of the last parts of the show, and it seems that Kienan is planning a life after Craigsong.
According to official records, he is the director of Adrift Moon Limited.
Scottishsan's sources suggested that Kienan was involved in the "active restaurant trade" in Glasgow, but the actor refused to comment on the story.
"The sea belongs to us":
The sailors patrol the navy headquarters equipped with La Paz.
There's a blue flag in the public building.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to Amazon is covered with motto: "By right, the sea is ours.
It's my duty to get it back.
The memory of the coastal lines that were lost in the bloody conflict of 19th century in Chile through inland Bolivia is still vivid: the desire to sail the Pacific once more.
On October 1, Bolivia is probably the best hope for decades to await the decision of the International Court of Justice after a five-year review.
"Bolivia has a momentum, solidarity and calm spirit, and of course, I expect the results to be positive," said Boliviaan diplomat Roberto Karzadira.
Many Bolivians see the ICJ ruling on the national screen, and expect the Hag court to agree optimistically with Bolivia's claim that Chile, after decades of proper consultation, is obliged to negotiate a way out of its sovereignty to the sea.
Evo Morales, the indigenous President of Bolivia, who is facing a controversy in the next year's reelection, also participates in the ruling on Monday:
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts feel that the courts are less likely to decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and that would not change much.
The Dutch-based United Nations organization has no authority to give Chile territory, and it stipulates that it will not decide the possible outcome of a conference.
The decision of the ICJ was made in just six months after the final argument, and it showed that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zarate, an expert in international law.
It's a long way from moving forward with Bolivia's factors, and it may have turned back in the last four years.
"The issue of accessing the sea was taken over by the current Bolivian government," says Zarate.
Morares' war-tricks, she suggested, shattered the good-will of Chile that remained.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk until some point, but it is extremely difficult to continue.
Since 1962, the two countries have not traded ambassadors.
Former President Eduald Rodríguez Vertze, the group's Bolivia representative, denied that the court's decision was abnormally swift:
On Monday, Bolivia will be "a special opportunity to create a new era of relations with Chile" and will give "the opportunity to put an end to the 139-year conflict over mutual interests," he said.
Karzadira also denied that Morales (one of the most popular presidents in Latin America) is using the ocean as a political support.
"Bolivia never gives up access to the Pacific," he added.
The judgment is an opportunity to find out what's going on in the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if we don't trust the United States
North Korea's foreign minister Li Yong-ho says if Washington can't be trusted, his country will never disarm the nuclear weapon in the first place.
Li was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the US to comply with a promise made during a summit meeting in Singapore between rival leaders:
His comments will be made by the United States.
Li continues the sanctions and says it’s a fantasy dream that American opposition to the declaration to end the Korean War has brought North Korea to an end.
Washington is concerned that the plain will agree to this declaration without the first significant disarmament move:
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a growing skepticism about the seriousness of the practice of abandoning weapons that might be considered the only way to guarantee security.
Pompeo is going to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show has released an up-to-date line of massive headware and is being carried to high street near you.
It's decided if you want to increase the collection of hats or block the sun completely.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have published a line-up of crazy weight-head gear for the S.19 collection of runways that attracted the style of Paris fashion week:
These designers have sent their spectacular works to Cat Walk this summer.
The painting that caught Valentino's eye was an over-sized beige hat with a large feathered feather.
The other oversize accessories were made of jeweled watermelons, wizard hats, and pineapples, but they were not designed to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also released a strange mask make-up--and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were more like Hannibal Lecter than an autoktull.
One of the works was like a complete scuba diving gear with a snorkel and a goggles, but the other was like a melted ice cream cone.
You're lucky if you continue much of your fashion philosophy.
The fashion experts predict that a giant hood might go to High Street near you.
The biggest hat, from Leahna to Emily Latajkovski, is getting hot with the heel of the two-foot-long straw hat La Bomba.
The cult brand behind a very unrealistic hat that jumps to social media is a straw beach bag, almost as large as a bathing model.
The burned orange raffia bag, with its raffia fringes and white leather handle, was a prominent piece at the La Riviera SS19 collection in Jeckms, Paris.
"We expect large hats and beach bags to appear on high streets next summer.
John Edwards: The language skills required for global citizens.
Scotland's private schools maintain academic achievement, and this is another set of excellent test results that will only be strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community performances.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Independent School Council (SCIS), which has more than 30,000 students across Scotland, are trying to provide students and their parents with the highest level of service.
Private schools aim to prepare students for higher education, their chosen careers, and their social lives as global citizens.
In this educational sector, where we design and implement custom maids' school curriculum, modern languages continue to be popular subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak in a language that you understand, it goes into your head.
If you speak his native tongue, it goes into his heart."
This reminds us that we should not rely only on English when building relationships and trusts with other people.
The results of recent tests this year show that language is at the top of the league table and students at private schools are most likely to pass.
The total number of students learning a foreign language is 68 percent.
The data collected from 74 schools of the SCHS shows that 72 percent of the students who learn Mandarin get Haigrade A, but 72 percent of the students who learn German, 69 percent of the students who learn French, and 63 percent who learn Spanish also get A.
This shows that the Scottish private schools encourage learning in foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Language is currently treated as a choice subject, like science, technology, engineering, mathematics, etc.
A 2014 survey of the British Job Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the reasons why employers struggled to fill out a vagrancy was due to a lack of language skills.
So language skills are increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in situations where globalization increases the opportunities for jobs that require language.
No matter what career you choose, if you get a foreign language, you will have acquired this skill for life, and it will be a real success in the future.
To be able to communicate directly with foreign people means that a maringarian person can gain the upper hand in competition.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent did not have enough foreign resources to talk, and the ratio of people who speak two-digit languages was only 15 percent French.
That's why it's important for children today to invest in language education.
In particular, children in the developing world will be more likely to get meaningful jobs by having multiple language abilities.
In Scotland, different languages are taught by different schools.
Many schools focus on more traditional modern languages, but in other schools they will be teaching the most important languages in Britain, including Beijing and Japanese.
No matter what the kids are interested in, there are a lot of choice of language in private schools where there are professionals in this field.
In Scotland, private schools are focused on providing a learning environment that provides children with the skills they need to prepare for the future and succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In a global business environment, language continues to be so important for the future of the country that it needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should be regarded as an international communication skill.
Private schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice, diversity and better education.
I ought to do that.
John Edwards is the director of the Scotland Council of Private Schools.
Leblon, Sunday at San Diego.
Leblon James will soon be graced with a fan-sustaining Los Angeles Lakes debut.
Ruk Wolton, director of the Lakes, announced that James will be in the pre-season with the Denver Naguetz in San Diego on Sunday.
But I don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be less than a minute and less than 48 minutes," said Walton on the Raykers official website.
Mike Trudel, a reporter for the Lakers, tweeted that James plays only for a limited time:
After training earlier this week, James was asked about the pre-season six games of the Lakers.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need a pre-season game to prepare for the season.
Larry, YouTube channel, card.
President Donald Trump will start a series of election meetings tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first meeting scheduled for next week in five places, including friendly places on cards such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval for the Supreme Court pending, Trump aims to strengthen support for the coming midterm elections, since the Republicans are at risk of losing the majority of the parliament in the November elections.
What time is this Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The rally at Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled today at 7 p.m. on September 29, 2018.
Larry from card West Virginia can watch live streams on YouTube below.
While the FBI investigates the alleged sexual assault of Supreme Court candidate Bret Cavano, the Trump is more likely to comment on this week’s Kabanu hearing, while a vote of approval at the Senate has been postponed and tense for a week while the FBI investigates the charges of sexual assault.
But the main objective of the rally is to hit the momentum of the Republicans facing difficult battles for the November elections.
According to Reuter, the next week, the next five meetings in President Trump's camp are aimed at "strengthening volunteers and supporters to protect the Republican majority in the Senate and the House."
"The majority of parliament's seats are so important to his policy that the president is going to visit as many states as possible for a busy election season.
According to Metro News in West Virginia, tonight's gathering at Wesvankoreina in Wheeling is "a potential source of support from Ohio and Pennsylvania for media coverage in Pittsburgh.
The card won more than 40 percent in West Virginia in 2016, but Saturday's visit to West Virginia will be the second one in a month.
The cards are trying to support West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Molysi, who is late in the polls.
According to Reuters, political scholar Simon Haider at the University of West Virginia said that the president's coming to support him is not a good sign for Molysie.
The US's choice shows hope and courage to fight for the singles on Sunday.
On Saturday afternoon, after three session games which resulted in one-sided results, Fosom just needed this ridercup.
In sports, the notion of 'stimulation' is not based, especially in such games.
So, who's going to get the momentum now?
"I think we're going to have a little more momentum because we've got a six-point lead, but now we've got four points," Jordan Skobby says when he's finished the day and pulls up.
Of course, Europe has a four-point lead, leaving 12 games.
As Sponge puts it, there are many factors in the success of the United States selection, as well as the success of Sponge and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points at four games.
Sculles are ruthlessly attacked from tea to green, leaving an example.
He and Thomas were led two points after two holes, but as the round went on, the cry of blessings grew, and the final Pat went down to match the fourth match.
When I put him in 15 holes and won, the same male shout he raised was a demonstration of his belief that the US team was not yet losing.
"I have to focus on my match and do my best," said Sponge.
Now, each of these players has only one game left.
18 holes will win.
In the last two days, the only players who've raised more points are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Freetwood, the main topic of the rider-cup.
These two crazy and beloved European winners won four victories in four battles without making a mistake.
They were not only the only pair that didn't hit Boggy at the Saturday afternoon session, but they also avoided him on Friday afternoons, Fridays, and late Fridays in the late 9th and late afternoons.
When you look at the energy of the two players in addition to carrying these games and the fierce crowd, it is clear that they should be defeated on Sunday, and that none of them are more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari in order to prevent European victory in the final battle of Le Golf National.
We want them to achieve it at the same time in another hall.
However, the European victory has not yet been won.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson have easily won a win for the morning hero of the Forball, Sergei García and Alex Norlen.
Garcia and Lennon couldn't make it after digging a grave with Boggy and two double-boggy in the first nine.
Sunday, I don't have any friends to help me.
So, forballs and forsams are very interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between each pair, the advice they give and the lack of advice, and the rapid change in strategy.
Although Europe has been a better team and has taken a big lead in the final day, the Forsum session showed that it is willing to fight over the anxieties of the US, especially the fears of the American side.
On the last day of the rider-cup, Europe's selection is leading at 10-6.
The European race, after a Saturday game of Forball and Forthham, is leading the United States at 10-6, and is moving well towards the final day of the rider-cup.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who have won the fight against Tiger Woods, have expanded their scores to four points previously at Le Golf National.
Thomas Byon's European choice for a trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltin was to take over the U.S. for the first time in the morning and set the score to 3-1.
The U.S. race won two fights in Forsam, but it still couldn't lose its mark.
The US selection, led by Jim Fulik, needs to get eight points in a single 12th of Sunday in order to preserve the trophy.
Freewood and Molinari, who not only became Europe's first rooky in series, but also became the second in history to raise four points in the first four match:
After sending down Woods and Patrick Reed in Forball, they showed great solidarity, and they won a score of 5 and 4 that stands out even in the depressed Woods and the Bryson Deshanbos of Rukie.
Woods, who didn't get up in two games on Saturdays, has sometimes shown a great performance, but he's not only lost in 19 of the 29 games but also lost seven times.
Justin Rose, who took a break in the morning forball, joined with Henrik Stenson in Forsam and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka in two and one in the world.
The south-west course of Paris has become a good day for the breezes, but not the European's.
Three major champions, Jordan Scud and Justin Thomas, raised two points on Saturday and set the criteria for the US selection.
They won 2&1 against John Lamu and Ian Paulter in Spain and won 4&3 on the first two holes.
In the history of the rider-cup, it has been reversed from four points in the history of singles twice in the past.
But for the U.S., who's been out of line for two days, it seems that Sunday's fighting back is beyond their ability.
North Korea says there's no way to disarm one side without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions that follow have increased their distrust of the United States and will not abandon nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the annual UN General Assembly, foreign minister Li Yong-ho said that North Korea has taken "an important act of goodwill" during the past year, such as stopping nuclear tests, stopping missile launch experiments, dismantling nuclear testing stations, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But there is no significant response from the United States," he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, our trust in national security will be lost, and under such circumstances we will not be disarmed one by one."
He repeated his complaints that North Korea would not be rewarded by the US government for its progressive "non-nuclear" approach to North Korea, but his statement was significant in that the North Korean government, unlike ever before, did not immediately reject one-sided nuclearization.
At the first summit between the President of the United States and the North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, Kim Jong-un promised to focus on the "unnuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and mentioned a joint statement that Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the US says it needs to give up nuclear weapons first.
The U.S. government also resisted the call to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. claims "unnuclearization first" and imposes further pressure on the United States by sanctions to achieve its goal, and against the Declaration of the End."
"The perception that we can yield by sanctions is the illusion of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the sanctions continue to increase our distrust."
She did not mention President Trump's plans for the second summit of gold and cards in the United Nations earlier this week:
Instead, highlighting three meetings with President Mun Jein in South Korea for the past five months, he added: "If the non-nuclear parties were not in the US, then the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been too difficult."
Even so, the tone of the foreign minister's speech was quite different from when the gold called the "president of evil" and the Trump called the money "the rocketman" in a suicide attempt, at the United Nations General Assembly last year, saying that North Korea's rockets would not be able to reach the mainland of the United States.
The Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised the United Nations for its courage to work on disarmament this year, but said that there are many challenges and that we need to keep sanctions until North Korea becomes nuclear.
On Wednesday, Trump can take two, three years, even five months, and I didn't set this time frame.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should pay for North Korea's actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Ponteo said on Thursday at the United Nations Security Council: "The Security Council sanction must continue severely until it is confirmed that there has been a complete and final non-nuclearization."
Since 2006, the Security Council has combined the sanctions against North Korea to block the funding for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile development.
Pompeo has a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the United Nations General Assembly, and said that he will go back to China next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but no results have been made on his last visit.
After leaving Moshu in July, he told us that there was a development, but in a few hours North Korea accused him of making "a gang request".
North Korea has promised to dismantle missile facilities and nuclear facilities this month, if the US takes the corresponding action.
He told him that money was the corresponding action he was looking for: the security Trump promised in Singapore and a move to normalize the relationship between the US government and the US government.
So let's take a look at a couple of examples.
This year, at Harvard University's new course, we're going to try to get all the students to sleep more in order to fight the expansion of the "all-night" culture by taking a cafe.
The world's best Harvard students are often ignorant about the very basics, such as how to take care of themselves.
Charles Zeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham & Wimens Hospital, designed this course.
He talked about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning, and then came up with the idea of starting the course.
"The last girl came to me and said, "Why am I finally listening to this?"
I was surprised that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep.
In the first course of this year, we will explain to students how good sleep habits promote learning and motor skills and improve general wellbeing.
Paul Valeira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's medical services, says that the university decided to introduce a course after learning that week of serious lack of sleep among students:
One hour's course contains a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students can learn about coffee cups, curtains, sneakers in the dorm room, the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deprivation, and the importance of day - sleep.
Another section explains how chronic sleep loss can contribute to heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Also, a map on campus where interactive icons are distributed encourages participants to think about their daily affairs.
"I know that the student's behavior will not change immediately.
But they have the right to know, they have the same right to know how smoking affects their health.
There is also a culture that boasts of "Study All Night" and says that the increased pressure on modern technology and students has increased the problem of sleeplessness.
Good sleep is a "secret weapon" of students fighting stress, fatigue and anxiety.
Raymond Thor from California, who studied chemistry and physics, helped design his course after his first class at Harvard University.
The course woke him up and wanted to expand the course throughout the campus.
And the next step he wants is to make sure that every graduate student gets a similar learning program before they start to learn where the competition is called Harvard.
Professor Tsaisler recommends setting alarm time for students at the same time as they go to bed, being released from electronic screens and LED lighting, and being aware of the harmful effects of "Blue Light" that can lead to sleep problems.
Rifigston 1 - 0 Rangers:
The Rangers were defeated again at the Way, and thanks to the goal of the Riverston's Dory Menga, the missing Rangers in Stephen Gerard's pack were defeated at 1-0.
The IBrocks-based Rangers were trying to win the Away for the first time since the 4-1 victory in St. Johnston in February.
Menga's goal was up seven minutes before half-time, and then it didn't seem like the inspired rangers were getting the same hit.
The Rangers are now in sixth place, but Rivingston has surfaced in third place, second only to the Hiberian.
And since the jury's column Spence had to be treated with a head wound after being thrown from an Away audience, the Rangers could face further trouble.
Gerard changed eight members when he broke the Air and entered the Bettfred Cup semi-finals and entered the match.
On the other hand, Holt maintained the same Illession as he did last week when he took the points from the Hertz.
The Rangers won the property rate, but Rivingston hit more effectively with less Possion.
Just two days after it started, Mid-Filler Scott Pittman, from Menga's first pass, has faced the goal to protect Alan McClelger, but he's off the side and miss out on a decisive chance.
Then, General Craig Halket received the free kick at the Penalty area of Kegan Jacobs.
The Rangers took control of the ball, but the finals ended up playing, not with a certain play, but with a hopeful observation.
Colombian Alfred Morelos insisted on Penalty when he collided with Stephen Lolles after 15 minutes.
The Rangers gave up two in-depth shots, but former rangers GKliam Kelly saved Lassana Krivari's head and a single Ovié Ejalia's shot without difficulty.
The last 34 minutes of Rivingston were contrary to the course of the match, but no one can deny that they are a gift from hard work.
The Rangers couldn't handle Jacob's setpiece in the Penalti area.
Declan Gallagher passed to Scott Robinson, Robinson calmly sent Menga a path, and Menga made it easy for him to reach the goal, but Scott Arfield couldn't handle it.
Gerard replaces Ryan Kent at half-time with Krivari, which soon worked out well, and the Winger Krivari sends a pass to Morelos, but Kelly came out from the goal line and blocked the ball with a safe.
But Rivingston played the game at his best and handled the longballs that were sent out in succession by Lisgo and Halket.
The Holt-led Rivingston had the chance to stretch the lead at the end, but Jacobs's shawt was blocked by the Macleather's good fortune, and the squirrel's headshot from the next corner fell off the side.
Glenn Middleton of the Rangers, on the way out, offered the penalty when he was involved with Jacobs.
(Applause)
"Sunday Morning" page: September 30, 1882.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, which will eventually become known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger counter, a major scientific force, has been the power of pop culture, as seen in the 1950 movie Bell of the Bell of Coronado, dressed as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, an unlikely cowboy scientist.
(Laughter) man:
"It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium."
With earphones, you can actually hear the effect of atoms released by radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Oh, my God, I can hear you playing."
Hans Geiger died a few days before his 63th birthday in 1945.
But the invention that bears his name continues.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify damaged cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify and kill defective cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of its treatment.
We're going to use this technique to extract immune cells from the patient, and we're going to make changes in the lab.
This allows the cells to "discover" proteins that are common to many cancers and to re-inject them.
The test vaccine shows promising results among large-scale cancer patients.
In the case of a woman who received a vaccine to tell her immune system to recognize defective cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this way, when you extract immune cells from the patient and make changes in the lab, you'll be able to "discover" proteins that are common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject this cell.
Professor Jay Bersovsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results showed the effectiveness of the vaccine.
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has also been effective in treating some form of leukemia.
Kanye West used SNL to spread his support for the cards wearing maguilars.
It buys bad publicity.
Kanye West was hit with a bow, saying he'd run in 2020 with the support of President Donald Trump in the studio while performing the Saturday Night Live.
After singing the third song of that night, "The Ghost Town" with the "Maek America Great Agene" cap, the West continued to speak out against the Democrats and support the Trump.
When I spoke to a white man, he said, "How can I like a Trump?
But if I had been concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago."
SNL started this day with a Hollywood star, Matt Damon, who gave the testimony of Bret Kavaneau at the Senate Judiciary Committee against the charges of sexual assault by Christine Bresey Ford.
Although not aired on the West's violent video, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
Whether Locke tried to mock the West with that post or not is unknown.
The West also complained to the audience that he had struggled behind the scenes for the hat.
"They picked me up on the backstage.
They say, "Don't go out with your hat on."
I've been bullied!
He says I'm at the bottom.
The West said, "Would you like to see the abyss?" and then he went on, "I'm going to wear Superman's cape, and nobody can tell me to move on to the world.
Then let's try love."
In his comments, the SNL casts seemed confused, and Baraéti reported that the whole studio was quieted.
West was invited to replace his former rapper, Mack Miller, who died a few days ago.
The West sang "I Love It" in Pelier bottle costumes, and they got a lot of people confused.
"Thank you for the bravest spirit to stand against the mob."
But Karen Hunter, host of the talk show, tweeted that the West is simply "they are, and very wonderful".
"But I chose (by buying his music and clothes and supporting his "art") not to pay people who spread harmful ideologies to my community.
He's free.
She added that we should.
Before the show, rapper announced that he had changed his name on Twitter, and now he said he's officially known as Canie West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, but he's following the footsteps of Didi, also known as Phdadi, Puffy, and Pdi.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dog, has a name for a Snoop Lion, and of course, the legendary prince of music changed his name to a symbol and then changed it to an artist previously known as Prince.
An attempted stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast.
A man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday, and a 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder.
Police report that this happened in Barry Hakamore.
On Monday, the defendant will appear before Belfast's Judicial Court.
The prosecution will review the charges.
The Star of Rhodes, Kit Harrington, attacked a man of poison.
Kit Harrington is known as Jon Snow, the sword's best friend, in the HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Salts.
But Kit, 31 years old, attacked such a rival hero's stereo type, and said that the role on the screen made the boys feel that they have to be strong enough to get their hands on them.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times culture, Kit said he felt that something was wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic maleity in the #MeTooo era.
Recently married to Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old co-worker at Game of Rhodes, she admitted to feeling "very strong" about dealing with this issue.
"I don't know what's going on," said Mr. Marvel.
"What have you taught the growing boys about the problems we see now?"
Thanks to the very masculine character, I believe TV may bear a part of the responsibility for the increase in toxic maleity.
He continued, "What was it that was born and taught?"
Do not the boys feel that they have to be men of certain qualities because of what they see on TV or on the street?
I think this is one of the big problems of our time.
When you look at a young man, it is clear that something is wrong.
In the interview, he also said, "No more battlefields and horses," and admitted that after the game of salts ended next summer, he wouldn't listen to the first and the last of them.
Since November, Sam Shepherd will be performing for "Tru-West" again.
He says the best thing recently was meeting his wife Rose.
"Because I met my wife on this show, she gave me a future family and a life to live."
Rose played Igritte, a lover of Jon Snow, in this fantasy series that won the Emmy Prize.
They were presented in June 2018 at a real resley home in Scotland.
HIV/ AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
More than 280,000 people in the country are affected, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sexual intercourse, with changes from the past.
In the Middle World, HIV spread rapidly in some areas as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has dropped almost to zero in this way, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in Hokunan.
But the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 over the previous year.
In China's LGBT community, HIV infection due to sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
While homosexuality has been legalized in China in 1997, there is said to be a growing discrimination against LGBT people.
According to the survey, 70 to 90 percent of gay men and women will eventually marry women due to the country's conservative values.
Many of the infections are due to a lack of precautions in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide broad access to anti-HIV drugs as part of the initiative.
You've been accused of being a "dangerous lie" and a "conspiracy theory" by the Congressional senators who deny the leak of data from their staff.
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters denied the charge on Saturday that one of her staff posted an identity of three Republican Senators on his Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrats affirm that the claim is made by critics of the "super-right" and the website.
"False, lie, and base lie," said Waters in a Twitter statement:
Sources indicate that Senator Lindsey Graham of the state of South Carolina and the home address and phone number of both Senators Mike Lee and Orlin hutch, elected from Utah.
This information was posted online by an anonymous person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on the charge of sexual assault on Supreme Court candidate Bret Kabano.
The data leak occurred after three senators questioned Kabanu.
The newspaper The Hill reports that conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedState have an IP address that belongs to Waters' office and has published information about its employees:
"This baseless claim is a total lie, and it's absolutely a lie, and Waters continued.
"My staff has violated identity, identity, and security due to these false accusations, but this leak of information has nothing to do with them.
This baseless claim is a complete lie, and it is absolutely a lie."
Waters' statement was immediately criticized online by some, including former White House reporter Ali Frysher:
Frysher wrote that this denial was only anger.
"This showed that she was not worthy of the senator.
Don't be angry if you are accused of something you didn't do.
Don't be arrogant.
Don't ask the defendant's motives.
We must act calm and calm."
Frysher seems to be comparing the reaction of the Democrats to the reaction of the Kabanu's attitude at a hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Oma Navarro, who seeks a seat in Waters in the middle election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter:
"It would be great if it were true."
In her statement, Waters says that her office has been "reporting these false claims to the authorities and to the police."
She says, "We will do everything we can to make sure that the killer finds out."
"Johnny English" film review of the "Reverse of Analog"
In recent years, it has been decided to identify the meaning of Briggsy for a new movie that depicts Britain’s decline, which seems to be the same as Johnny English's follow-up comedy.
Can this ironic self-sympathetic cartoon about how powerless we are, be a new export opportunity for Britain?
In any case, Johnny English, an insensible man with a rubbery face, keeps repeating his mistakes in this work, his name suggests that he is more than anything else a comedy made for movie lovers outside the English-language world.
Of course, he's a stupid secret agent who's misunderstood to his charms, but he has all the elements of the character that played only the song of the fire runner at the 2012 London Olympics.
Johnny English was originally based on Atkinson's world traveler in a now forgotten Berkeley card TV advertisement, which is a mystery.
This latest one has one or two good scenes.
When Johnny English comes near a helicopter wearing medieval armor, it's a scene where the Lotter Blade makes a sound on his helmet.
While atkinson's body of comedy is also being demonstrated, when you consider that "real" movies such as 007 and Mission Incessible also include comedy elements, the humor is quite weak and strange.
Its humor feels like it's for kids rather than adults, and Johnny English's extraordinary adventures seem to me to be less original and less focused than the game of the silent movie in Atkinson.
In this film, the current permanent topic of serious British problems is presupposed:
The cyber-scraper's invasion of the British secret spy web network and the identity of all British agents in action have left our agent in a state of shock.
The news has already gone beyond the limits for the noble Prime Minister, who has already had a lot of problems and a low support rate.
Her clever advisor says she has to summon retired spies because of the identity of all active agents.
So it's also heard of Johnny English, who works as the head of an elegant school and teaches him how to be a secret agent, secretly.
English will head to the White Hall for a quick briefing and meet his former partner, Ben Miller, who's been struggling for years.
Boff is now married and married to a submarine commander (in a healthy, blood-type role).
And the Queen's secret service's shoddy company will be resurrected and meet up with the beautiful Fém Fatar, Ofilia Britova, who plays Olga Cullenco.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister has been at the mercy of a billionaire named Jason Volta, who claims to solve the plight of British computers.
English and Boff, dressed as waiters, set fire in luxury French restaurants, and make a fuss about breaking into Volta's luxury yachts, and cause great confusion when English uses the virtualized headset to know what's inside the Volta house.
It's true that all the tricks are gathered at the end of the mountain, but this lovely comedy is generally like a children's show.
It's quite ordinary.
And like other Johnny English movies, the British film industry could not help thinking that Rowan Atkinson could not give him a role that suited his talents:
The Labor Party denied that they were considering a plan to pay five days' wages for four days of work a week for their citizens.
Jeremy Corbin's Labor Party seems to discuss a radical plan for citizens to receive five days' pay for their work four days a week.
The party wants to share with the workers by increasing their salary on funds obtained by the companies' management through the AI revolution.
It is estimated that employees will work three days a week while earning the same salary.
Information sources say that the idea follows the party's economic policy and plans to make a country that would benefit the workers:
The change to four days a week is approved by the Labor Union Assembly as a way to benefit from the economy changing the workers.
"The review of policy will be announced by the end of the year," says a labor official in The Sunday Times.
"It is not possible to do this overnight, but the four-day workweek is the target of the party's approach to reconciling the economy to the advantage of the workers and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Green Party has pledged four days of work a week during the 2017 general election campaign, so the Labor Party does not support the idea for the first time.
However, at present the entire Labor Party is not supporting its goal.
A spokesman for the Labor Party said, "The four-day labor system is not the policy of the party and the party is not considering it."
The Minister of Shadow, John McDonnell, created a vision of the socialist revolution in the economy last week at a labor conference.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from a faceless executive of a public interest firm and a misbehavior.
The plan of the Minister of Shadow can also be "responsible" because the Labor Party's government recognized the injustice, and the current water company's shareholders may not be able to recover all their share of it.
He also put workers in the company's board, created a comprehensive ownership fund, put 10% of the private sector's capital there, and confirmed that the employees were planning to receive an annual salary of up to 500 pounds.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
The FBI's investigation of Judge Brett Cavano's accusations has led to the question that the final vote on the appointment of the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week and that the government's investigations could endanger the support of the Republican Senator.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, special correspondent Scott Perry asked Republican Senators, Lindsey Gram and John Kennedy if they could find something that would change the FBI's mind:
Kennedy was more open than Gram, a fellow in South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
I told him I was going into a hearing.
And then, after an accusation, I called him and said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined and clear.
But it seems impossible to change the vote.
"In the case of Brett Cavano, I'm determined, and it will be very hard to blame."
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett strongly denied it.
"I'm sure you're right," said Mary. "I'm sorry."
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new changes.
What did the Global City Festival help to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host an annual musical event, the Global City Festival.
In the 7th year of this year, tens of thousands of people gather in Central Park's lawn square to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, Sean Mendez, to raise awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Cities Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international rights organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting.
Unless they wanted to buy free tickets for the event (if they wanted to buy VIP tickets), concert participants had to volunteer, email the world leaders, phone calls, or other meaningful work to raise awareness about ending poverty, namely, "action".
But how many more years has the Global City Festival achieved?
Is it an honest way to convince people to take action in exchange for a free concert, or is it just a matter of signing or tweeting an online petition?
Since 2011, Global City has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from supporters and has promoted different goals.
These actions have caused world leaders to announce a commitment and policy worth more than $37 billion, affecting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars had already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that the money received has had a direct impact on about 649 million people around the world.
The major commitments include a commitment to help children grow up to the full potential and include a power commitment, a partnership between British-based investors and the organizers.
"With the support of the British government, the donors, the governments, and you, we can remember the social injustices of malnutrition.
The group also said that there were more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom calling on mothers and children to improve their nutrition, and that the government has announced funding for power integration, a project to provide nutrition for five million women and children.
The question on that website, "Do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
And then the last thing we're going to talk about is global Citizens saying, "It's going to be a long and difficult road.
But since we have power when we gather together, we will succeed like the great civil rights and the anti-parity movement.

The U.S. can use the Navy to seal off Russian energy exports.
The U.S. government has revealed that if it is needed to prevent Russian energy from destroying the market, it can “reliance to the navy” in areas including the Middle East, reports the director of the interior of the United States, Ryan Zink.
Jink argued that the involvement in Russia in Syria is an excuse to open a new energy market, especially if it is at the invitation of the legitimate government.
"They're in the Middle East because they want to communicate energy, just like Eastern Europe and southern Europe."
According to the officials, there are ways and means to work on it.
"The United States, along with the Navy, can confirm that the Sirens are open and seal off the market if necessary," he said.
Jink was speaking to delegates at an event hosted by Consamer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that takes a position as an energy consumer in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran to the fact that both companies are the same:
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is to use more or less fuel," he said, and he said that Russia is "one trick pony" that is economically dependent on fossil fuels.
While the card regime has a mission to promote the export of hydrocarbons to Europe as a much cheaper option for European consumers instead of Russia, this statement was made:
To that end, the management of the Trump regime, including President Trump himself, is trying to convince Germany to get out of the "inappropriate" two pipeline.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the 11.1 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipelines planned to double the capacity of the existing pipelines:
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of the competition.
"We believe that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers.
The U.S. Stans has provoked a reaction, and Germany has re-confirmed commitment to the project.
The BDI (BDI), a major German industrial organization, asked the United States not to talk to the EU’s energy policy and the two-state agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem for Third World countries to interfere with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to "search the details" of her presidential election in 2020.
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "search closely" the presidential election candidates after the middle elections.
At the city hall in Hol York, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
According to Mr. Hill, it's time for a woman to enter Washington and rebuild a broken government, including a woman to take the top.
I'm going to look into the presidential candidates after 6th of May."
Warren joined the debate about President Donald Trump during the Town Hall.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy," she said.
Warren has made bitter criticisms against Trump and Bret Kavaneau, the candidate of the Supreme Court that he has appointed.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said before he voted, "We need an FBI investigation, of course."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that Warren's own district did not expect her to run for office in 2020.
According to the University of Suffolk's Center for Political Research/Boston Grove survey, 58% of Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run for office:
32% supported the candidate.
The polls showed that 38% of the former governors supported the possibility of running for Deval Patrick.
The names of other prominent Democrat politicians that are being discussed on the potential candidates in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Byden said it would be officially decided by January.
Sarah Palin referred to Palin's PTSD at the Donald Trump rally.
A 26-year-old truck Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is experiencing, and what he is experiencing when he returns, I share with other families the bad effects of PTSD and the wounds the soldiers have on them on their return.
And then he said, "Well, I don't know about you, but I'll tell you a little bit about Paul, who called his arrest "the elephant in the room," and about his son and other war veterans, and they'll come back a little bit, and they'll be stubborn, wondering if they have that much respect for what all the other members of the army have given to the country.
According to the spokesman for the Oleira Police Department, Dan Bennett, he was arrested on Monday in Isleira, Alaska, obstructing reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons during drunkenness, and charged with domestic violence against women.
18 states and Washington D.C. support opposition to new refugee policies
18 states and special districts of Colombia support legal objections to a new U.S. policy to prevent the asylum of victims fleeing gangs and domestic violence.
According to NBC News, a representative of 18 states and special districts filed a court-advised report in Washington on Friday and supported a protest against the policies of refugees.
Grace, Sessions, the case was filed by the United States Civil Freedom Union against federal policy in August, but the full name of the appeal has not been revealed.
She said that her partner and "his violent gang members" had abused her, but the US authorities refused to apply for protection on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorneys supporting Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are facing widespread gang and domestic violence and that there are numerous refugee applications in the United States.
The new U.S. refugee policy reversed the decision of the 2014 Eid Council of Migregants, which allowed migrants fleeing from domestic violence to seek asylum without documents.
In a Friday statement, Columbia District Attorney General Carl Racine said that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires all refugee claims to be determined based on certain facts and circumstances, and such hard times are violated by those principles," says a court adviser.
In his report, the director also said that immigration is more likely to become an entrepreneur, and that the policy to refuse to enter the country is damaging the U.S. economy, while "supply the necessary labor force".
In June, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the victims of domestic violence and gang violence to no longer protect immigration officials.
"Refuge is available to those who leave their country because of racial, religious, national, or political persecution or fear of a particular social group," said Sessions in his policy on June 11.
asylum was not intended to reduce all the problems that people around the world face every day, even the most serious ones.
In the battle of finding survivors, the death toll in Par's desperate rescue effort
For the survivors, the situation is even worse.
"You look very nervous," said 35-year-old Lisa Ksma, who kidnapped a hot baby boy in a fire shelter in Par.
"An ambulance will bring in people every minute or so.
There's very little clean water.
They returned to their destroyed homes, picked up their flooded belongings, and saw residents trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude were filled.
Some of the wounded, including Dui Harris with his waist and shoulders, were resting outside Paul's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside because of the strong aftershocks.
When I remembered when the fifth floor room in the hotel where my wife and daughter were with him was shaken by a severe earthquake, tears came to his eyes.
I didn't have time to run.
I think I'm stuck in a broken wall.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then I couldn't hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and her kids.
I hope you're safe.
US Ambassador, China's "advertising" harassment.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement promoting the mutual interest in trade in the United States, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American newspapers for propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who denied China last Wednesday, blamed China for trying to interfere with the American parliament elections on November 6, and then referred to China's paid advertisement for the newspaper in Demoine Register, the largest newspaper in Iowa.
The criticism of Beijing’s efforts to interfere with the U.S. elections showed that, as U.S. authorities told Reuters, it is a new phase of Washington's campaign to pressure China.
It's normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements for trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently in the midst of a growing trade war that imposes the same tax on each other’s imports.
China and US experts said that China's retaliation tax was designed to hit state exporters like Iowa, who supported the Republicans who led the Trump.
Terry Brandtt, an American ambassador to China and a long time ago the governor of Iowa, a major exporter of produce to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses:
In the opinion of the demonstrators on Sunday, the Chinese Brandtt posted that “aggression of propaganda against our country’s freedom of press is increasing.”
According to Brandtad, "the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's most important tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of publication by posting a paid petition to the Demoin Register to spread propaganda."
"By contrast, here at Beijing's street newsstands, we can't see any real reflections of the different opinions that the Chinese people would have about China's confused economic orbits, which are under Chinese Communist control."
He added: "One of China's most famous newspapers prevented me from publishing."
An analyst warns that the riots surrounding Kaabaner will lead to the separation of women voters from the Republicans before the middle elections.
Many Republican leaders are defending the Supreme Court's candidate, Bret Kabourg, for multiple charges of sexual violence, and analysts warn that the Republicans will be rejected by women in the upcoming midterm elections.
This riot has caused a lot of emotions, most Republicans are already hoping to go ahead with the vote.
In an article published in The Hill on Saturday, Professor Grant Leil, of the University of Laques School of Political Sciences, said:
Professor Leiller said that Senator Jeff Freke's initiative to investigate the FBI at Girygiri is questionable as to whether it is enough to make the voters angry.
According to a Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karin Jean Pierre, a senior advisor and national Spokane Woman of Moveon, said, "The women will not forget what happened yesterday and will not forget it until November."
In spite of the testimony of Dr. Christine Brassley Ford by the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee on Friday morning, protesters in front of the Senate shouted, "November is coming!"
Political analyst Stu Rosenberg, a political analyst outside of the party, told news sites that the party's enthusiasm and motivations would be incalculable."
"Some say this was originally a high one, but it is true.
But this could be even more likely, especially for the women voters in urban areas, and the young voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who have no good opinion of the president, but the majority of those voting rates are low."
In front of public testimony that Mr. Ford has been sexually assaulted by a court of justice, analysts suggest that if the Republicans went ahead with their approval, there would be a reaction.
According to NBC news, Michael Sutier, former chairman of the Republican National Party, said last week, "this disturbance has caused a terrible mess with the Gop."
Guy Cecil, a Democratic campaign support group, pointed out that "the issue is not just the vote of the committee and the final vote to decide whether and whether Kabourg will be appointed on the news channel, but the question is how Republicans handle this disturbance and how to deal with her."
However, the American public is divided between whether to believe in Mr. Ford or Kabourg's testimony, and the latter seems to be the majority.
According to a Yugava poll, Kasbourg was 35 percent when 41% said they believed in Ford's testimony absolutely/likely.
In addition, 38% said in his testimony that he probably lied.
With his backing, the FBI has also begun investigating the testimony of Ford and another accuser, Debola Ramiretz, the Guardian.
Mr. Ford testified under oath last week to the Senate Legal Committee that he was attacked by a drunken Mr. Kabourg when he was 17 years old.
Ramiretz also testified that he exposed his genitals during a party in the 1980s, where the Supreme Court's appointed judge was at Yale University.
Plan to launch the world-wide web inventor, Google and Facebook instead.
Tim Berners Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has set up a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon, Google.
Inlp is the latest project by Lee, a technology regenerator, and is based on the open-source platform "Solid" by Berners Lee.
Solid gives users a choice: where the data is stored, and who has access to the information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast, Berners Lee gave the joke that the secret intentions of the Infrapt are "world domination".
We're going to talk about startups and startups and startups.
This is a historic moment.
This app allows you to create your own "private online data store" using Solid technology.
This includes contacts lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's also available from a single browser, like Google Draw, Microsoft Outlook, Sack, and Spotify.
A unique feature of personal online data stores is that who can access information depends entirely on the user.
It's called "the personal enforcement through data."
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inlp, the idea is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills so that everyone can use Solid.
The Inlp is currently composed of the developers of the On staff and the community of volunteers.
From this week, technology developers around the world will be able to make their dispersal apps using tools available on the Input website.
Berners Lee says that he and his team are talking about introducing a complete change in the way Facebook and Google business models are stuck in one night.
"I do not ask their permission."
On Saturday's media release, Berners Lee says the mission is to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem that ensures the integration and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
Berners Lee founded the World Wide Web Constituency at the University of Technology in 1994 and changed the Internet.
In the past few months, Berners Lee has been making an influential statement in online debates:
Barners Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Foundation, Webfunding and Open Data Institution, even while it is being launched.
"I'm very optimistic about this next generation of Webs," added Berners Lee.

Having won the Victorian Cross Medal as a combatant during World War I, celebrations were held in the town of a hundred years ago in connection with the only Church of England.
Minister Bernard Van Van won his medal on September 29, 1818, by the Battle of Bergeringleys and Leowkor.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper, and did not know that he was the highest honor of the British army.
On Saturday, a parade was held in Lashden, North Santos, and the monument was opened by his two grandsons.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was a very synergy thing about the stela, and that it had just been published just a hundred years ago from the works that his grandfather had been medalized for.
According to The Guardian of London, on September 29, 1818, Commander Van led his army through a very dense fog, a fierce fire from a front line, and a machine gun.
Then, with "Great Courage" on the front line of the fire, he rushed with one of his arms, pushed back the front line, and defeated three of his squads.
Commander Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1818, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72 years old, says, "I cannot imitate my grandfather's actions.
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, held a big celebration after a parade led by the Brandtwood Youth Band.
Michael Vann said, "I felt a great honor to participate in the parade," and added, "The courage of the real hero has been demonstrated through the support of many."
It's a little bit like this.
Imagine how you feel when Verrator 206 spent the whole night without seeing this main event.
The building of San Jose was made up of 13 battles.
At 6 a.m., the broadcast turned to Peppagg while George Moussasi and Lori McDonald were preparing to fight.
The audience who stayed awake until early in the morning for this fight was particularly depressed.
One fan posted on Twitter about what happened on TV for children: "This is some kind of a bad joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Verrater's senior vice president, Dave Schwarz, who is in charge of communications, replied, "At 6 a.m., the government has forced us to switch to children's programs because of regulations that say combat skills are not suitable for viewers."
"Peppag is the right one.
Verratur, president of Verrator, says that in the future, he will consider schedule adjustments that will take into account British viewers.
"I think it'll be all right by the time we rerun it."
"But since it was 6 a.m. on Sunday, I couldn't adjust until Monday in England.
We're in the process of adjusting.
When the broadcast went off, there was a lot of text going on.
And I tried to get it back to the point where I had a technical flaw.
But that wasn't the case.
This is what's happening on the next broadcast.
So we're going to go from the six to the five, and we're going to go from the six to the five.
This was an unfortunate situation.
Dessert Island Disk.
The Olympic diver Tom Daley, who grew up feeling inferior in the case of sexuality, became a motivation for success.
The 24-year-old Dare didn't realize until he went to middle school that he was different from the kids around him.
On Radio 4 Dessert Island disk, presented by Lauren Raburn, the dale player told others about Gaylatz to give them hope.
I also told them that being a parent has reduced my interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a temporary presenter on the long-term show, has not been present in months due to his illness.
In his first show, he appeared as cast-away, and said that he felt inferior to everyone, because "to love both boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He says: "To this day, feelings of inferiority and isolation have always been real, giving us the strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that he was worth something.
This year, at the Commonweals convention in Australia, Dalé, who won a couple of bronze medals at the Olympics, joined a major LGBT campaign, and appealed to more countries to legitimize homosexuality.
Dare says he's lucky to be able to open his sexuality and live without interference, and he's decided to speak up to give others hope.
The three world champions, Darre, tell of falling in love with American filmmaker and man Dustin Lance Black, who said it was “a surprise” when he met him in 2013.
Darley married Mr. Black, who won the Oscar award in 20 years.
"I've had a lot of experiences since I was very young, and I've been in the Olympics for the first time since I was 14 and I've lost my father to cancer three years later.
This couple became parents in June, and his son is Robert Ray Black-Darley, who says "all values" have changed since his birth.
"If you were asked about this last year, you would have said it was all about taking a gold medal."
"But actually, there is something more important than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is the lobby."
His son was diagnosed with a brain tumor and succeeded his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
One of my father's last words was that he had already arranged tickets to the 2012 London convention.
"By the time I was in the front row, I was no longer in the world, I couldn't say."
He held his hand until he stopped breathing.
The following year, Daleer attended the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"Then I thought this was all I wanted in my life.
This experience has also inspired the first selection of Dare, and Heather Small's "Proud" sounds like a growing process of his journey to the Olympics.
Dessert Island Disk, BBC Radio 4, Sunday British Time 11:15.
I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
The U.S. Phil Mikelson is trying to set a new record for the 47th race against the rider cup on Sunday, but we need to review the form so that this doesn't turn out to be an unfortunate outcome.
Mikelson, who is trying to set a 12-part record for this two-year event, was ordered by Captain Jim Fulik to enter the bench on Saturday for the Forballs and Forsam.
Mikelson, who has five majors' experience, has gained much attention in many games in the United States, this time leaving his role behind to participate in competitions.
For him, it's the top of his career, but drivers aren't perfectly straight.
The course itself is harsh, but on Sunday, it's going to be the ninth match against Francesco Molinari, the champion of the English Open, who teamed up with Rukie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of the games this week.
If the United States starts with 12 single matches with four points lost, it'll be hot from the beginning, and the Mikelson game will be very decisive.
He said he trusted Mikelson, but he didn't say much.
"He knows exactly what he's doing today, and he says he's ready tomorrow with my back lightly and shoulders together."
"There seems to be enough confidence.
He's a very popular player, and he's contributed a lot to the team in the past.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I thought I'd play a little bit more, but this is what I did.
"I want to go to the other side of the room, and I want to go to the other side.
Mikelson will remove the record of Nick Fard on Sundays and set up the most frequent track for the rider cup.
This could lead to the end of the career in the Mikelson rider cup.
However, Furik says that his presence brings him to the team a spiritual place.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, and he loves to mess with people.
And he said, "Well, I think this week, young players enjoy working with him.
"He's the one who will bring more than a play."
The great leader is soon to disappear.
From his own experience, European captain Thomas Byon has learned that even though he is leading a lot at the start of the last day of the ridercup, the situation can be reversed.
Byon from Denmark had his debut in Valderma in 1997, and the team then led five points to the United States, with the result that he managed to win a victory of 141⁄1-131⁄2.
Remember, the photograph of Billon, who won the game in Le Golf National on Friday, 5-3, and yesterday after he saw his team lead at 10-6, he took a big lead in Valdelama.
This history shows that I and my team have not yet decided on it.
So I'll do my best tomorrow.
So let's do that.
So let's do another one.
We have a goal to win the trophy.
I've been saying this for a long time, but I'm passionate about my team's 12 players, but I know what they might be.
As I am happy that my team's players are on a high-level golf course, Billon adds: "I'm never proud of myself.
We have enemies tomorrow.
So, we're going to be able to see the performance of the individual tomorrow and the different elements.
It's nice to be with friends when it's good, but in personal warfare, all the qualities of a golfer are tested.
We have to send this message to all of our athletes.
We need to get away from them this time, and they need to do their own best.
In contrast to Byon, Jim Fulik is trying to get his players to take on more personally than the team.
Fulik himself has taken both sides about the outcome of his fate.
When Captain Ben Krenshaw, in 1999, was asked to gather players for the final day, he said, "I remember the words clearly."
"There are 12 matches for tomorrow, but it's expected to happen quickly, as we saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
It's a little bit more complicated, but it's a little bit more complicated.
We've got a strategy for the situation, and we've chosen people according to intuition.
Thomas is the leader of the team, and the top match is against the rosley makii, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Lam, Tommy Freetwood, and Ian Poulter are the top European players.
"I put the players in this order because I think this is how they get through the whole."
Germany's new army and postponement
Local media reported that the German Navy was planning to renew its present degenerative warship to the latest frigate ship in 2014, but the system's problems and the cost of continuing to swell were at least impossible until next year.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, who quoted a spokesman for the army, the launch of the Reinland Fartz, the latest frigate ship in the Verden Virtenberg class, was extended until mid-2019.
The battleship was scheduled to be introduced in 2014, but the post-conflict trouble that followed made the ambitious plan a lot worse.
In 2007 the Navy ordered four Barden Vultenberg frigate ships to be used by the military on behalf of the currently degenerating Bremen-Frygate ships.
In addition to powerful cannons, anti-aircraft missiles and antiship missiles, there are also some stealth technologies, such as de-degraders, infrared and sound signatures.
Other important features are the long maintenance cycle.
However, the newspaper Die Zeit points out that the latest military vessels that are supposed to play an important role in displaying military power abroad because of the continued delay in the project will be obsolete by the time the actual use of them is started.
The F125 frigate that follows the trouble became a big news story when it was returned to Broome Unt Fawces, Hamburg, after the German Navy officially refused to launch last year.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a ship-builder after its entry.
We do not know the exact cause of the return, but German media have quoted information about several serious software and structural defects that could have been incompatible to combat missions.
The breach in software is particularly significant because the Verden Vültenberg frigate, which is half of the personnel required for a generation of Bremen, is driven by about 120 marines.
It's also so heavy that it reduces performance and restricts future upgrades for the navy.
The weight of these 7,000 tons of Rhineland Falz is said to be twice as much as the ship that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to structural defects, the overall cost of the project, including training of the crew, has also emerged as a problem.
The overall cost of the project has been said to be rising from the first 22 euros to 31 euros (36 U.S. U.S. dollars).
Recently, there has been a warning that the German navy forces have been weakened, and the issue over this latest frigate is very important.
Since the turn of the year, the German Parliament's Secretary of Defense Hans Peter Bertels acknowledged that the Navy has actually lost a military vessel with a capacity for deploying Capacity.
He said the use of old warships has been suspended, but there is no alternative, so the problem is increasing with time.
He also expressed regret for the fact that the Verden Vultenberg frigate was never introduced to the Navy.
National Trust, pressing on the bat's mystery.
A new study conducted on land in a highland region of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use their terrain to hunt.
The study is expected to bring new information about this unique flight of mammals and contribute to future conservation efforts.
In this study conducted by researchers in National Trust for Scotland, we track common bats, sopranopells, roundingers, and doventons in the Inverwe Gardens of Webster.
We set up a special recorder at the main points of the site and track bat activity through the seasons.
The NHS staff and volunteers also conduct mobile devices using mobile devices.
All the sounds recorded are analyzed by experts, as well as the frequency of the calls made by bats, and reveal what kind of species they are.
Based on analysis, you will produce a habitat map and a report, and the behavior of bats will be detailed in order to fit the terrain.
Robb Duwa Nature Advisor of NTS hopes studies will reveal where bats are most important habitats and how they are used by different species.
This information can be used to determine the benefits of habitat management, as well as how to establish habitats for bats and related species, and how to protect the forest.
Throughout Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the past 100 years.
Bats are at risk of extinction due to construction and loss of habitats that affect the state of dead trees.
In addition to the chemical processing of insects and building materials, attacks from pet cats, windmills and lighting, are also at risk for bats.
And they're not blind, they're not blind.
But because of their nightly behavior, bats have a tendency to depend more on hearing than they can see.
Bats use their development of echolocation skills to capture insects at pinpoints and recognize obstacles in flight routes.
There are 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and the NTS, who manages assets over 76,000 hectares of land in the country, facing bats very seriously.
The NTS has 10 experts who study regularly and test the trees and even protect the bats.
The NTS also has the first bat reserve in Scotland in the Three Estates of Dunfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten bats live in Scotland.
David Thompson, who manages the Estate, believes the land is an ideal environment for bats.
"This is the best place for bats," he says.
"There's an old building, there's lots of old trees, all of which are part of the habitat for bats.
But since there are so many things that bats don't yet know, activities here and elsewhere can help us understand what we need to reproduce bats."
He believes that if a bat accidentally destroys a tree that is raising a child, it will kill up to 400 female and young bats, and it will lead to extinction of the land, so it is important to confirm the bat’s conservation efforts in the land before performing any conservation work.
Bats are a protected animal, and it is illegal to kill, abuse, interfere, or cut down a tree.
Elizabeth Ferrel, director of Scotland's Department for Bat Protection Trust, wants local support:
He said, "There's still a lot to learn about Scottish bats, and I really don't know how bats behave."
Lawyers are prepared to deny the Ronoado rape charge and sue a private magazine.
Kristiano Lonaid denied the rapes he was accused of and used his name as his "prostitution" to accuse him of being a liar.
His lawyer is preparing to file a lawsuit against the German weekly magazine Deia Der Spiegel, which published this doubt.
The Portuguese player, who works for the Forwards in Yuventos, has been accused of rapeing an American woman named Kaslin Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He also suspected that he had handed this woman $375,000 and asked her to tell him that the case was missing.
A few hours after this report was received, a 33-year-old man called the news "fayk news" to 142 million followers through his live video on Instagram.
"No, no, no, no, no.
The article reported on Faik news today, and Ronaldo, who has won Valondor the last five times, said to his camera:
"I'm going to use my name to promote myself.
So let's say that this is the same thing as this.
And if you want to make a name for yourself, you want to make my name known to your magazine.
"I'm fine. I'm totally fine."
According to Reuter, his lawyers are preparing to sue Deia Schpygel for the doubt, and they have criticized the journal for “reporting in an unsolvable form of speculation that could fill the realm of privacy.”
According to Christian Schultz, he is likely to charge "one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years, with enough compensation to match the severity of the violations.
The spiraling incident is reported to have taken place in a suite at Las Vegas Hotel and Casino in 2009.
According to documents set up by the Clark County District Court of Nevada, Mr. Lonaud and Mayorga went to his room after they met him at a nightclub, where he had raped Marjorga's anus.
Marorga says he kneels after the incident and says he's "99%" and "one percent" bad part.
According to the document, he recognized the sexual relationship between them but agreed:
Marjorga also went to the police and asked for a picture of the bite at the hospital.
The 34-year-old Manorga is now asking for abdication because of the ongoing trauma caused by a suspected case.
Lonaad was transferred this summer to the strong Italian Yuventos, when he was transferred from Manchester United to Realmad.
Bregzit, England, will forever regret the loss of the auto industry."
Greg Clark, the Minister of Business, said that the British would "be sorry" for losing their status as a car manufacturer who is driving the world by the briggit:
They added that they were "aggregating" that if the British Toyota leaves the EU without consent to the BBC, they will stop manufacturing at their Bernaston factory.
Clark, the Minister of Business, said we need an agreement.
Japan's auto manufacturer says that if the Bregzit was established without agreement, the delays at the border would result in loss of business.
In the Bernaston factory in Toyota, "Orlis" and "Avensis" were produced, and of the 150,000 cars produced last year, 90 percent were exported to the European Union outside the United Kingdom.
The director of the Barnaston factory in Toyota said, "If the British are forced to leave the EU at the end of March, the factory will be shut down."
Honda, BMW, Jaggerland Rover, and other British auto manufacturers are also concerned about leaving the EU without an agreement on border transactions.
So, we're going to talk about this in a few minutes.
The central concern of each car manufacturer is the supply chain risk of unconventional brigzits.
The production line is based on "Jeist in Time", and custom-made vehicles use parts that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
According to the auto industry, leaving the EU without agreement on March 29 could lead to delays at the border and delays in the arrival of parts.
The company's Derbyshire factory cannot maintain its inventory for more than a day, so production will be shut down.
Clark said that Prime Minister May's "checkers Plan" was "well designed to avoid inspections at the borders that the industry is concerned about."
"We need an agreement, not only to enjoy the success of the present moment, but also to make the event a chance," he said on a BBC Radio 4-today program.
"Not just toyitas, but other manufacturers have shown that we need to be able to keep up with the supply chain that has worked very well until now."
Although the Toyota doesn’t know how long it will take to stop production, in the long run, additional costs will reduce factory competitiveness and will eventually affect employment.
Peter Zowbalis, a 24-year worker at the Barnaston factory and a representative of the union union, said that there is growing concern among the union members: "If you lose this experience, no one will ever ask you again.
The government's spokesman said that the government is offering a reliable and reliable plan on the relationship between Britain and the EU.
"The conference of Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed."
A high level meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Secretary Rob Rosenstein was announced on Sunday by the White House that another "week" could be postponed because of the ongoing conflict over the candidate of Brett Kabano Supreme Court.
Rosenstein oversees the operation of special agent Robert Moller, who is investigating Russian electoral interventions, the link between President Trump and Russia, and the President's obstruction of justice.
In the past few months, attention has been drawn from around Washington to see if the President of the Justice Chief of Justice, Mr. Mora, will be affected by his independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was in a meeting wearing a device to record a conversation with President Trump, showing the possibility that he would be released through Article 25 of the U.S. Constitution.
Mr. Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House and reported that he had resigned.
At the time, it was announced that a meeting would be held on Thursday with President Trump at the UN headquarters in New York.
The meeting was postponed because of the weight of the Senate's judicial committee's schedule and the weight of the hearing, after which Mr. Rosenstein's release of the card, both of Dr. Christine Bresey Ford, one of the women who is accusing Mr. Kavaneau of making fun of him, said in the hearing:
On Friday, Mr. Trump ordered an FBI investigation of a week's charge against Mr. Kabbouran, and the vote in the Senate would be further delayed.
Sarah Sanders, a card reporter, responded to Fox News on Saturday.
I was asked about the meeting with Mr. Rosenstein, and she said, "That day is not over yet.
So, we're going to talk a little bit more about what's going on here.
Some reporters will disagree: Mr. Sanders hasn't been in the press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why:
Sanders told me that the lack of briefings did not mean that she disliked the TV reporter's standplay.
It suggests that Mr. Card will have more direct contact with Press.
President Trump also said that he was spending more time in response than the former president, but he didn't give evidence: "The number of times he did was confirmed."
The briefing will continue, but Mr. Sanders, if you have a chance to ask the President of the United States a direct question, it should be absolutely better than asking me.
We've been doing a lot of work to make this happen, and you know we've been doing a lot in the past few weeks.
He often asks questions when he leaves the White House to attend a public meeting or a press conference.
But the single press conferences are rare.
The reason for this is because of the President's character, such as his freeness of speech this week in New York, or his unnatural appearance in front of a crowd of reporters.
Open a letter to EU workers in Scotland’s NHS, who are worried by the Minister of Health, Bregzit
The Minister of Health has told the EU staff working in Scotland NHS that they want to be grateful as a country and to remain in the same position after Bregjit.
Now, six months after Britain left the EU, Jean Freema of MSP published her letter:
The Scottish government promises to provide EU citizens who already work in government public services with the cost of applying for permanent housing.
In his letter, Mr. Freeman wrote:
But the British government is preparing to consider the possibility of the Nodir scenario.
Let's do another one.
So I want to tell you that I think the contribution of all staff, regardless of nationality, is very valuable.
Our colleagues from EU and other countries are bringing valuable experiences and skills, improving health services and contributing to the patient and community we serve.
I'm sure Scotland is your home, and I hope you stay here.
Christyon Akhlonby, head injury and emergency surgery.
Christoon Akhlonby, a lineback in Tiger, Tennessee, lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Comovez, injured in his head on Saturday, and had emergency surgery, reports the Tenesian Mike Organ.
According to Head Coach Rod Reed of Tennessee, the injuries occurred just before the half-time:
"He came to the sideline and collapsed," said Reed.
The trainer and medical staff took oxygen from the sidelines before carrying the Akhlonby on the stretcher, and took it to a stretcher for a detailed examination.
The Tennessee State Bulletin told WSMV Chris Harris that the Ajaklonby had been operated on at the Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.
Harris added, "We still don't know much about the type of injury or the severity of the injury."
This was the first season in Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois to Akhlonby, a second-year Red Shirt player.
On Saturday, he successfully successfully tackled a total of five tackles until he left the match, 18 times during the season.
To more tariffs and tariffs for foreign buyers in British real estate.
Foreign buyers are going to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy British property.
Kobin was successful in collecting young votes, but this move is expected to counter it.
The higher tariff tax is aimed at people who don't pay taxes in Britain.
The agency hopes to earn more than 120 million pounds per year, which is filled with homeless support.
Prime Minister Teresa May today announced that foreign buyers will be charged with higher tariffs when buying British property, and profits will be filled with homeless help.
Jeremy Corvin has succeeded in collecting young votes, but this move is seen as an attempt against the forces by promising to tax the higher incomes while providing more cheap housing.
The higher taxes are imposed on individuals and lawyers who don't pay taxes in Britain.
The tax revenues are now added to the print tax, which is up to 3%.
The agency predicts that it will make 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new buildings are being purchased by foreign residents.
The rich areas of England, especially the capital, are becoming "ghost town" as more and more foreigners spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new policy was announced a week after Borris Johnson suggested that young people reduce their postage tax so that their first home would be easier to buy:
He accused a large construction company of taking over the land to keep housing prices high, and urged Prime Minister May to cut off the upper limit of the cheap housing to correct the British housing problem.
Kobin has issued a series of proposals that have focused attention on housing reform, including the control of loans and the rooting of the "no pay" agenda.
He also wants to empower the parliament to build a new residence.
Prime Minister May said: " last year, I told the Prime Minister that I would try to rebuild the British Dream through the office of prime minister.
This is what we're going to do in the next video.
It's not just the United States, it's the United Kingdom.
However, while British residents are working hard, the situation is certainly not good for the uninhabited individuals and foreign companies in Britain who can easily afford housing.
"For many people who dream of having a house, it is no longer a far-off dream.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate dream is to be manager of the Scotland team."
Jack Roth, a Sanderland boss, told me that one day he would be manager of the Scotland team about his "final dream".
He's 42th member of the Scottish team, trying to revive the North East Club, now in third place in League One, with three points on top.
Last season, the man who led St. Milan to the Scotland Premium moved to the stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play as a player in my mother's country.
I got a B Cap, but that was all."
"When I was a kid, I grew up watching the Scotland team in Hamden.
"I'm not going to do that." "I'm going to do that.
Before Mr. Ross, the Sanderland managers include Dick Adfot, David Moys, Sam Aladdis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gustavo Poje, and Paso di Carnio.
He, too, has been rejected from Burnsley and Ipswich Town in the past because he is not afraid to associate with famous people at such famous clubs.
"My success now depends on whether I can get this club back to the Premium.
The club's organization and facilities are no doubt the Premium League itself,” he says.
"It's never easy to get there, but you probably don't think you've succeeded unless you get the club back to it."
I've only been the manager of Los Angeles for three years, but I've been an assistant boss in Danvers, and I've had 15 months as a coach for the Hertz.
After that, he restored Aroa from a third-hand position and led St. Milan to the winner of the championships in the next season.
Ross says he's calmer now than he was when he played in Clyde, Hartpur, Volker, St. Milan, Hamilton Akadec.
"It was really a turning point in my life."
"I really thought that management was better than players.
I was doing well as an athlete, so this might seem strange.
But playing is hard.
So let's do one more problem.
It's the same thing in terms of stress and pressure, but it's like management is good for you.
I've always wanted to be part of the management, and now it's happening.
The previous interview will be broadcast on Sunday, September 30, at 12:00 to 13:00 in the sports sound of Radio Scotland.
The study found that the best time for drinking was 5:30 p.m. Saturday.
British pubs are suffering from financial difficulties, but they're increasing their sales due to the intense heat of summer.
According to the survey, sales in July increased 2.7% in pub bars and 4.8% in restaurants.
Peter Martin of CGA, a business consultant who took together the results of the survey, said: "The strong days followed, the longer the British fought in the World Cup, and the seven months passed, in June of the previous month, when the pub increased by 2.8%, but it was a further blow to the restaurant.
In June, the restaurant business dropped by 1.8%, but July was even more severe.
In the previous year's sync ratio, pubs and bars, which are the main products for drinking, have become the best in Dantuts.
The pub, which is the main food commodity, is not as strong as the restaurant business, but is suffering from the sun.
So let's think about it a little bit.
The sales of drinks in the pubs and bars in the department have increased by 6.6% over the previous month, but the diet has decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, RSM's RSM columnist, says: "These results have been a continuing trend that we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and large social/ sports events are a major factor in the sales of foreign food industries.
It's no longer surprising that the restaurant group is running in a constant fashion, but it will be particularly painful to see that the annual synchronization rate has been reduced by 4.8%.
The long summer heat has come at an even worse time for those who make the meal their main product.
The price of July in the whole pub and restaurant, including the new openings, increased by 2.7%.
The Caffer People's Tracker monitors the sales of British pubs, bars, and restaurant sectors and collects and analyzes performance data from 47 management groups.
One out of five children keeps a social media account hidden from their parents.
A survey revealed that 1 out of every 5 children holds a social media account hidden from their parents and teachers.
The survey was conducted on 20,000 middle school students and found that the "false input" pages were increasing.
This news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
It's called the "main" account.
One out of five children has created a social media account to hide it from adults, including 11-year-olds.
The study was conducted on 20,000 middle school students and found that the "false input" pages were rapidly increasing.
This news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
It's said that 20 percent of students have a "main" account and a secret account at the same time to show parents that they don't like content.
One mother happened to discover a secret website for her 13-year-old daughter and found her posting "raping" to others.
The study was conducted by digital Avatarness UK and the Head of the Independent School of Schools (HMC), with 40 percent of students between 11 and 18 years of age having two profiles, one of which was a secret account.
Mike Butchaman, chief of the HMC, says: "I’m shocked to find out that many teenagers want to create an online space that their parents and teachers can't find."
Ally Doyle, Scotland's Olympic Committee, will be the voice of the athlete.
At a general meeting of Scotland's Astrotic Committees, Ary Doyle was elected as Non-Edstivative Director.
Doyle is a land athlete with the most glorious achievements in Scotland, and President Ian Beatty told people in the sports field about his decision that it would be a good opportunity to apply her experience at an international level for the past 10 years.
"We are convinced that allies are highly respected by Scotland, the UK and the world's Olympic community, and that by electing her as a member, the Scottish Olympic world will benefit greatly," he says.
"I would like to work very hard to bring the voice of the athlete to you, to help you contribute to and fight Scottish sports."
Four Olympic medals, including the 1996 Olympic medal winner 200 meters in the Athens Olympics and 400 meters, were won by an American male who now appeared in the BBC as an expert with a temporary cerebral hemorrhagic attack and was unable to walk.
He posted on Twitter: “Today, a month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor told me it's not gonna be long before I can recover.
It was a very difficult journey, but I was able to fully recover and walk again.
"Thank you so much for the encouraging message!"
We've got two minutes online.
A milking machine manufacturer has published ad that shows milk cows milking their nursing mothers while they are nursing, and two opinions have been divided online.
A consumer technology company, Elby, published an advertisement that was inspired by a comical music video to announce the release of the nursing mother by this new milking machine.
Four real mothers dancing in a cowhouse filled with buns and songs containing lyrics like, "I'm milking myself.
The chorus continues: "Sweet, milk, milk the baby, milk the milk, milk the human woman, and I milk the human woman."
The ad, published on the Facebook page of the company, has provoked an online controversy.
The video has been played 77,000 times, has gathered hundreds of comments, the audience's reaction was both adversarial and a lot of it exposed to the 'fear' of the dairy industry in broad daylight.
"It's quite a mistake to use cow to advertise this product.
"The cow, like us, needs to be pregnant and give birth to milk, and the cow needs to be separated from the baby in the next few days," said one of the posts.
Elby's milking machine fits quietly inside the breast-feeding bra
Other comments say: "Of course, this is traumatic for the mother and the baby.
What about human mothers who don't take their babies?
One of them added: "It's an impossible ad.
Some people defend this ad.
"I think I'm a genius idea.
If I was still feeding, I'd be using myself.
The milking makes me feel really like a cow.
I'm glad the ads are just a little crazy.
Some said, "This is a great product.
Others commented: "This is an interesting advertisement for a mother who's breast-feeding and who thinks she's like a cow."
It's not an ad that admires or criticizes the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, we show the dancing women hiding the pump in the bra.
The concept of a campaign is inspired by the fact that many of the women who are breast-feeding say they are like cows.
However, Elvie Pump doesn't make a sound at all, has no wires or tubes, doesn't show up in nursing bras, women can move freely, hold babies, even go out while nursing.
As Mother's partner and ECD's Ana Balalin says, "Ervie Pamp was an innovative product, and I think it was a bold and exciting one.
By comparing female expressions with cows, the purpose was to draw attention to breast feeding and all its problems and to make it funny the surprisingly free sensation of new nursing.
This is not the first time that Elvie Pump has been widely featured.
During the London fashion week, two mothers using this product appeared on the runway with designer Marta Jakbaski.
They secretly transferred hundreds of immigrant children to tents across Texas border.
Although the number of migrants in the month remained relatively unchanged, the number of migrants who were detained jumped, partly because the Trump regime's severe retinue and policy made it difficult for them to leave their children to their assureders.
Up until now, most of the sponsors are migrants themselves, and have feared that applying for children will endanger their own stay.
The risk was increased when federal authorities would have to submit prints to those who would be guaranteed in June and other adult members of the family, which data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Alves, a senior member of the immigration Bureau, testified in parliament that he arrested dozens of people who filed a petition for minors who were not accompanied by him.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests had no criminal record.
" nearly 80 per cent of the individuals in the guaranteeor family have illegally stayed in the country, and most of them are foreigners with criminal records.
So he continues to track such individuals," he said.
According to the camp workers, they introduced a new rule that required some of them to appear in court within a month, rather than after 60 days of detention, which the authorities had set up in order to handle the children's application quickly.
Many will appear on video calls instead of in court and file a legal petition to the immigration court.
Those judged unworthy will be deported immediately.
According to reports from the camp workers and insiders of the past few months, prolonged child detention can lead to anxiety and depression, resulting in violence and escape.
The defenders said that large institutions such as Torniyo have raised concerns about the extent of the presence of signs of children facing difficulties.
He added that moving children into tents without sufficient time to prepare emotionally and say good-bye to their friends could make the trauma worse already.
The Syrians are ordered to withdraw immediately to the occupation army.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Al Muirem, addressed the United Nations General Assembly, calling for Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the eighth year of war in the country.
Mr. M'Alem, deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were stationed illegally in the land of Syria in battle against terrorism.
"We need to withdraw immediately and unconditionally," said the General Assembly.
Muirem claimed that since 2011, 360,000 people have died and millions have been displaced from their homes.
Syria said it would continue this crusade until it wiped out terrorist groups and "aliens living illegally" from all parts of Syria.
The United States has 2,000 soldiers stationed in Syria for training and instruction in Kurdish, Syria, and Arab training and instructions, mostly against President Washerd Al-Assad.
France has over a thousand ground troops in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, M’Alem blames the fact that there is no problem with the country's coming home and that “some Western countries” are “semilating irrational fears” so that refugees can remain in the country.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to encourage the return of our country," he said.
"They are politicalizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no support for the rebuilding of Syria until Assad and the opposition made political agreements to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey has created an opportunity for political dialogue to move forward in the last significant location of the Idrib rebellion:
Russia and Turkey have agreed to avoid a massive attack by the Syrian army, which supports the province of which 3 million people live.
However, Müllem emphasized that there is a definite term for the agreement, and he stated that military action targets the jihadists, including the Nasra fighters who are linked to al-Qaeda.
Stefan de Mistura, UN envoy, calls for a new meeting of government and opposition members early and hopes to raise the post-war Syrian constitution to hold the elections.
Mr. Muirem gave the Syrian government conditions to join the committee, said that the committee should be limited to "reviewing the terms of the current constitution," and warned of interference.
That's why the cards are re-elected.
According to the logic, unless the bullets and scandals decommission him early, as many liberal viewers would like, he will be re-elected in 2020.
I'm sure it'll be the most dramatic figure ever.
At the moment, there's no sign that the audience is getting bored.
Since 2014, the number of Golden Hour viewers has more than doubled with 450,000 on CNN, and MSNBC has nearly tripled with 1.6 million.
According to Neilsen, Fox News has increased the average audience of Golden Hours from 1.7 million four years ago to 2.4 million, and MSNBC's Rachel Madol Shaw has recorded 350 million people best on the newscasts of the night.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, which cannot be understood," says Neil Bea of the runner of the ABC drama "Savior: President of Destiny" which featured the president of the country after the attack destroyed the capital.
The author, Nell Skobel, a veteran comedy writer and author, wrote:
She remembers getting into a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh."
Confusion has an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, stories from American regimes determine whether they will be able to see the families of immigrants after the Law-Weid trial, or whether the world economy will be healthy.
Ignored is the luxury given only to the most fortunate viewers.
Yet, when the panel continues to watch for hours the use of "Dep Background" in Bob Woodward's book "FEAR," the 15,000 dollars in paul Manafort's daubon jacket (the clothes of arrogance, according to the Washington Post) and Stomat’s anatomical impact on Daniels’s Trump, it is more than an informed citizen.
Personally, I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
Some of his actions, which make him feel like a real charity show, offer him something to talk about every day, as well as the top management of the Weir House entertainment, and Bret Montgomery, the producer of the "Pawn Stars," is referring to the cast of the towrump show, or to the script that unfolds at different times (the battle against the NFL, or the praise of the money-appropriation).
I can't miss the episode I forgot.
This week, when I contacted Mr. Flass, he was out in the weather, 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kahuai, and he was watching MSNBC in the house recording the CNN.
He witnessed to Brett Cavano at the Senate Judiciary Committee and could not leave in a situation where the future of the Supreme Court was not set.
"When I was doing a lot of crazy shows, people said this was the beginning of Western civilization," he said to me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but I knew it was right.
As a writer for the Times, Amy Chojik, who writes about politics and media, is the author of Chasing Hill.
There's an external fund pouring into the mid-house election where the fighting is expected.
It’s no surprise that money has been poured into the 17th section of Pennsylvania, where two people have been in conflict with the same seat since the election district was renovated by Congress.
In this recent election district outside Pittsburgh, Democratic Senator Connor has been running for another district in a special election last spring.
The candidate against Mr. Ram is the former Republican candidate of 17th and 12th District of Pennsylvania.
In January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania renovated the district after it ruled that the former election district was illegally in favor of the Republicans.
The new 17th district's elections have been a violent conflict with the DCCC (DCCC), a fund-raiser of major parties, and the NRCC (NRCC).
Mr. Ram won the special election in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March and became known in Pennsylvania.
It was held by the Republicans for more than ten years, and Donald Card won at 20 points in the same district.
Political critics have a slight advantage over the Democrats.
The U.S. withdraws after considering the penalty to China's El Salvador
With little opposition from the US, diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama have approved China.
He had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Valera of Panama in June 2017, and stayed at the hotel in Panama until they pulled back the Trump assembly team.
The State Department official has decided to reintroduce U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama to a recent decision regarding the ban on Taiwan.
However, the penalty was considered only El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The penalty, including a reduction in financial aid and the target visa restrictions, was painful for the Central American nation, suffering from high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the internal considerations progressed, North and Central American authorities postponed high levels of talks that focused on security and economic development, which followed a similar meeting last year that was considered to be a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of immigrants into the US.
By the middle of September, however, government officials declared that they wanted to proceed with the meeting and, in effect, completed the review of the penalty for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pens is scheduled to address the importation of the government's plans to meet at a meeting in the middle of October in the parliament.
Without the release of new harsh messages and penalties from the United States, three emissaries returned secretly from El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama.
Mr. Bolton of the White House refused to comment on the details of what three high-ranking U.S. officials discussed.
These explanations were confirmed by an external analyst from government sources who spoke anonymously.
Research History
The next move is the possibility of a report by Robert Mueller, a special counsel on possible obstruction of Trump's jurisprudence.
According to reports, Mueller is looking to see if Trump's campaign has been co-operating with Russia, aimed at the US elections.
If the power of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will be held accountable for the majority of the parties and even for the council's jury while preparing for the reelection campaign.
There are many assumptions about this, but it does not necessarily mean that Mr. Trump or the former European head of state will lose his job.
We need to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which is how long the difficulty will last.
If the West were to resist Hitler and support the Czechs in Munich, German officials were ready to take a coup against Hitler in 1938.
They failed, and they missed the opportunity to avoid the massacres that have been raging for years.
History is changing direction from such a turning point to accelerate or block the strict progress of democracy.
Americans are facing some of these transitions.
What would happen if Mr. Card dismissed Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Minister of Justice who holds the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein's assumption that he was secretly recording the president last year and that he was not fit for a mission was followed by an article that put him in a tight spot.
Rosenstein said the Times article was inaccurate.
"How would you react if the newly requested investigation of Mr. Brett Cavano wasn't complete or fair, or if the Supreme Court approved him in spite of the authoritative accusations against sexual assault and false testimony?"
Are we going to vote for the middle elections in Congress that hold Mr. Trump responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will enter the long winter.
But I think there's a lesson I learned in Prague that I won't fail.
My mother is a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that took over my ambassador's house.
She survived and moved to the United States, and 60 years later sent me out to put a Sabbath candle on a table full of vodka.
In view of my tradition, why can't I look forward to the future?

Graham of the Rangers. Drones are confident of the raped Vienna battle.
The Rangers welcome Lapid Vienna home on Thursday.
Mid-Ferder Graham, who didn't go to this season with a knee injury until the Vijaral battle drawn by two to two, believes the Rangers will be able to make a leap from the outcome.
The 31-year-old player said it was a good team and it was good to get a point.
"We believed we could get at least one point when we entered the game.
Perhaps at the end of the day, the draw will be fair.
I think the first one was good, but in the second one, we took advantage of the game.
Thursday night is a big fight in the European League.
I hope you get three points, but it's going to be a tough game, because the other team was getting good results in the previous game.
Last year it was a tough year because of various things, such as my injuries and changes at clubs, but now I feel comfortable.
The team is doing well, the teammates are enjoying themselves very much, and the training is great.
From now on, we'll forget about last season and work on success.

Despite the fact that the surveyers have no clear idea of what kind of care they want, it's a decimal number for those who talk about their families and their families.
In a nationwide survey, about half of them say they are talking about the cost of spouse care and long-term care.
Only 10 percent of the kids were talking about it.
"People want to look after their families, but they don't actually talk to their families," said Holly Snyder, a nation-wide life insurance company.

The earthquake and tsunami in India.
At least 384 people will die and more will be killed by the strong earthquake and tsunami that struck Par, Indonesia, on Friday, the official said:
Communications are in chaos, and rescue authorities are unable to obtain information from the Dongara province of the northern part of the region near the 7.5 earthquake point.
In Parr, 16,000 people evacuated after the disaster.
Next, show the main facts about the island of Sulawesi and Dongara.
In 2017, it was estimated that there were 3,79,800 people in the province of Sulawesi, which is at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi.
This city celebrated its 40th anniversary during the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongara is more than 300 kilometers along the northwest coast of Sulawesi.
The province was a smaller administrative district, with an estimated population of 299,200 by 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries of the central Sulawesi economy, especially the coastal areas of Dongara.
Although the nickel mine is important in the state, it is mostly concentrated on the coast of Molowali on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster department, Par and Dongara have been hit several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by the tsunami, and hundreds of houses were destroyed in Dongara.
West Dongara was hit by a tsunami in 1996 with 9 dead.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Mountains, where earthquakes are frequent.

Sarah, Mr. Palin's eldest son is under arrest for domestic violence.
Former governor of the state of Alaska and former Vice President Sarah Palin's eldest son, Palin, was arrested for assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaskan state police, an Oralara (29 years old) was arrested for domestic violence, interference with home violence, and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, an acquaintance of a woman tried to inform the police about her crime, but he took her phone.
According to KUT, Palin is re-prisoned at the Mattz's trial facility and is held for $500.
According to the network, he went to court on Saturday and claimed "not guilty" to confirm his reply.
Palin's got three minor crimes in class A, a maximum of one and a half million dollars in fines.
He's also charged with misdemeanor B's class, which is equivalent to one day's imprisonment and two grand in fines.
It's not the first time a criminal lawsuit has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police for assault.
This case is now being tried by the Alaskan Military Court.
In January 2016, I was arrested for alleged domestic violence, interference with domestic violence, and holding my weapon in a drunken state in connection with this incident.
He claimed his girlfriend was hit in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a group of veterans who attributed her son's violence to PSTD, a military veteran in Iraq.
A tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds died.
On Friday, an earthquake struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, killing 384 people.
A quake of 7.5 magnitude caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks will be shut down and the death toll will continue to rise.
The earthquake took place in Sulawesi, a central region northeast of the Indonesian capital, Djakarta.
A video that captures the moment of impact is spreading on social media.
When the tsunami rose to the top of the coast, there were hundreds of people gathered at Par's beach festival.
Federal police are seeking a death sentence for a terrorist suspect in New York City.
Federal police in New York are asking for the death penalty of Sifro Sypov, a suspect in a New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people.
Sypoph, 30 years old, used a truck he rented at the home depo to hit a bike road along the West Side of Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists indiscriminately.
In order to justify the death penalty according to the intended death notice issued in the South New York area, the prosecutor needs to prove that ypov deliberately killed eight victims and "hidden" them.
According to the court's documents, all charges are in danger of death.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Cypov with 22 charges, including eight murders, assault, and car destruction, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime.
The prosecutor said the attack would require a "fulfillment and premonition" and described the crime as "evil, brutal and vile".
"Syphro Haviblja shrimp, cypov, Diego Angelique, Nikos Kreves, Aencold, Darendododoque, Ariel, Arnan, Ango, Mendoza, Alejandro Daguunko, and his family and friends."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last death penalty was requested ten years ago in the south of New York.
The defendant, Karid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug donors, but in September 2009, he was sentenced to life in prison.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York at the time of the execution of Julias Rosenberg and Essel Rosenberg, who were convicted two years ago of spying on Soviets during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs were executed.
Sypoph from Uzbekistan hasn't shown his conscience a few days or months after the attack.
The police said he didn't regret going to the agents.
According to the prosecution, he told authorities that he had come up with an attack by watching ISIS videos on his cell phone.
The police also announced that they have called for ISIS flags to be raised in the hospital room.
He also claims he's not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the U.S. public defenders in defense of Cypov, said he was clearly disappointed in the prosecutor's decision.
"We don't accept a conviction of prison sentences that can never be released, but we think that the death penalty will only prolong the trauma of such events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Cypov's lawyers wanted the D.A.'s death sentence.
A conservative member of the U.K.'s E.U. has said that Mr. Nigel Faraj is the right man to leave the EU.
Nigel Faraj declared that today, during a protest against the conservative party's meeting, "the people's forces" were being mobilized.
The former leader of the British independent party had to feel the pressure of the euro skeptics because one of the members of Terizama's party said he was fit to negotiate with the EU.
The conservative representative, Peter Bourne, said that if Faraj had been the Minister of the European Union, the UK would've already left.
However, the issue of May's meeting with the MPs he had divided was that the conservatives took part in a protest in the city against leaving the EU.
The Prime Minister has found it difficult to maintain a checkers plan for compromise in the face of criticism from the EU, the defectors and the EU.
Mr. May's defenders tried to make an agreement with the EU in spite of his opposition and claimed that they had to make a choice: her compromise or her confusion with the European skeptics and the Labor Party.
Mr. Bourne said that Sookhar's departure is a duel, and that "checkers want to give up."
He said that Faraj should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
He said if he were in charge, we'd already be out.
"I support the E.U., but the checkers should stop."
"We cannot dispute the EU and fight World War I and be subjugated.
We want to have our own laws.
Mr. Bourne kicked the idea that public opinion changed after the 2016 vote.
Andrei Jenkins, a conservative, EU-resistant member, also attended a rally and said to the reporter: "I just want to say this:
"The checkers aren't popular with the public, the opposition doesn't vote, and the party actually heads up on the streets and has won the election.
I want you to drop the checkers and listen to your opinions.
In a message directed to Mr. May, the Prime Minister said:
Faraj said if you betray the 2016 vote decision, politicians who took part in the rally will feel pressure.
"This is a matter of trust between us, our people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray the EU, so we can't admit it now."
"I want you to feel the pressure of the political class who are trying to betray the EU.
"We will not rest until the country's people's forces, which led to the victory of the EU, have mobilized its people's forces and have achieved independence and self-enforcement in Britain."
On the other hand, the rest marched in Bamingham and held a two-hour rally in the heart of the city.
After the launch of the group this week, an unconventional activist issued a banner of conservative parties against the EU.
The laborer's Baron Adonis ridiculed the conservative party for the security issue that was the party's app at the start of the match.
They have introduced an IT system and said that Canada and all other technologies can achieve smooth crossings and free trade without borders in Ireland."
It's a total prank.
He added, "There is no such thing as a favorable departure from the EU."
Mr. Warren is prepared for the presidential election.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, he was preparing for the presidential election.
Boston Grove reports that this Massachusetts Democrat spoke about the rest of the day on Saturday during a conference in western Massachusetts.
Mr. Wallen, who often criticizes President Donald Card, aims to re-election November against Republican Jeff Diehl, who was vice president of Massachusetts's 2016 elections campaign.
She's interested in challenging Mr. Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Hori York was a conversation with the 36th electioner when Trump became president.
One of the participants asked if she was going for the presidential election.
Warren said it's time to fix the government that's broken to the White House, and it's "including the president of women."
Arrested for shooting Simms at Louisiana State University.
The Baton Rouge Police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that Wade Sims, a basketball player at Louisiana State University, arrested a suspect for being shot on Friday.
Baton Rouge P.D. said they arrested D'theon - 20 - on the news at 11 a.m.
The police released the shooting on Friday and wanted information on the identity of the man shown on the video.
20-year-old Simms was shot dead on the campus of San Francisco early Friday morning.
According to 247sports, "Weid Simms died of a gunshot to the head" was released on Saturday by Murphy J. Paul's police chief.
Wade broke into his friend's defense and was shot and killed by Simpson.
He admitted to hearings, he was there, he had weapons, he killed Wade Simms.
Mr. Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Lutheran Police Department.
She grew up in Baton Rouge, a 3-year-old university, played at 32-year-olds last season, and 10 of them played first, averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 awards at the match.
(Applause)
On Saturday, the moment Barteril Bottas passed the pre-election above Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the order of Mercedes played a major role in the race.
Paul's first round was about to protect him from his first two laps, put Bettel in a competition with Hamilton, and eliminate the possibility of Hamilton's victory.
Bettel was first in the pit, and Hamilton was going to catch up with the round-the-backs, which usually determine the race.
Hamilton on Mercedes went into the pit one time and went behind Bettel, but at the third corner, he forced the Ferrari's Bettel to open its side and take the lead.
Max Belstuppen, who was born on his 21st birthday, started at the back of the grid and placed him in seventh place on the first lap.
After that, we reduced our time, and we didn't change our tires to get past the fourth Lynecone, and we set up the rank in most of the races.
Finally, we were in the pit on the 44th lap, but we couldn't speed up the remaining 8 laps.
It was a hard day.
Hamilton said the team did a great job with two and a half finish.
It's a terrible body, Lange.
President Donald Card laughed at the claim that Senator Diane Finestein was not leaking a letter from Mr. Bressie Ford accusing Senator Diane Finestein of sexual assault on the Supreme Court candidate.
The president, speaking at a rally in West Virginia, did not directly take up Mr. Ford's testimony at the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented on what happened in the Senate, showing that people were "basically mean and lying".
"One of the great things that could happen in the Senate recently was when he saw people who were angry and who were mean and lying."
"When I saw the release or leak, I didn't do it."
When I say, "I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Finestein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer and leaked her documents?
Could not close temporary folder: %s
He didn't leak.
Wait a minute.
He added with the Senator's impression that we leaked, no, no, no.
Mr. Feinstein received a letter in July stating the details of Mr. Ford's suspicions against Kabaneau, which was leaked in early September, and he denied that the leak was from his office.
He told the committee that he had not been hiding Dr. Ford's claims, nor had he leaked them."
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret as she requested."
But because of her denial, she did not seem to have a pace with the president who commented on Saturday night.
Perhaps she didn't think it was the worst body I've ever seen.
The president further defended the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual misconduct by 3 women, who said the Democrats were using suspicions for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take any means necessary.
"You'll see that you don't care if you're mean or mean, you don't care who you hurt, you don't care who you kick to power and control," Mediaite reported the President's comment:
The elite league.
Giants Patrick. Dowyer's in Dundee. Two goals.
Dundee Stars won the snow fight in Dundee on Saturday at 5-3 and paid for the defeat of the Belfast Giants of Friday's elite league.
Giants quickly took the lead of two goals at the goals of Patrick Dowire and Francis.
At the goal of Mike Sullivan and John Cooney, the home team did the same thing, but the Dowy goal took the lead again by Giants.
François Bouchard was the same in Dundee's goal, and he decided to win at 2 in Lucas Landald Neilsen.
For Adam Keefe's team, who defeated Dundee on Friday night, it was the third defeat in this season's elite league.
This was the fourth round of the season on both teams, but the last three battles were won by Giants.
Dowyer decided his first goal from the Assist at McFall in three-thirds of a second, and four minutes after that, he turned the lead two points from David Lusaford's Assist.
During the first period of the intense attack, the Sullivan team returned the point to 13 minutes, 10 seconds, 15 minutes, 16 seconds.
Before the first period was over, the Dowyer set a second goal this night, and the Giants took the lead and ended this period.
Home team re-evaluated, where Bouchard decided to go again 27 minutes and 37 seconds after his power play.
During the second period, Nealsen set a goal and started taking the lead in this match, and in the final period, he got the 5th point of the team to win.
In the last five games, the Giants lost four, and on Friday, they'll fight Milton Keanes on the platform.
Air traffic controllers sacrificed to watch hundreds of planes take off during the earthquake.
It is claimed that Indonesian air traffic controllers sacrificed their lives after completing their mission until hundreds of planes took off.
On Friday a massive earthquake hit Sulawesi Island, killing more than 800 people and missing a large number of people.
A strong aftershock continues to take place in the region, and many people are trapped in rubble in the city of Par.
A 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan completed his mission without running out of the violent control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Juju airport.
He stayed until he saw that Batik Air Flight 6321 was safely taken off the runway when the earthquake struck.
Then I thought the control tower was falling apart and jumped.
And then he died in the hospital.
John Seylath, a spokesman for Air and Navigation Indonesia, said the decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australia's ABC News.
We got him to a bigger hospital in another city with helicopters from Barik 8on in Calimantan.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived.
He added, "We're going to tear our breasts apart for this news."
On the other hand, authorities said the death toll could reach 1,000, and the National Security Agency said access to Dongara, Sigre, and Bhuton was restricted.
"It seems likely that more casualties are due to the fact that many people are still under the rubble and are unable to rescue them," said authorities spokesman Stopo Nugrobo.
The tsunami, which reached 20 feet [6 m], destroyed Parr, where mass burial will take place on Sundays.
Military and commercial planes are carrying supplies and supplies.
Lisa Cusma, 35 years old, told Sky News that an ambulance is carrying a body every minute.
We're running out of clean water.
The mini-markets are being plundered everywhere."
Jean Gerfund, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors in a hurry, but what do you think?
This is already a tragic situation, and it could get worse."
The Indonesian president Joko Widdo arrived on Sunday and told the National Army: “I want you to work day and night to fulfill all the duties necessary to evacuate.
"Are you ready?" The CNN reported.
Indonesia also has an earthquake in Lonbok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini reports a plane crashed in a coral reef and one of them is missing.
The airlines that flew into a Pacific reef off the coast of Micronesia, first found that all 47 passengers and crew members were safe from the sinking planes, but one male said they were missing.
Air Niugini announced that at Saturday afternoon, one of the men was missing.
The airlines have collaborated with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to confirm the presence of men.
The airlines did not respond immediately to requests for further confirmation of passengers, such as age and nationality.
A local boat rescued other passengers and crew from a plane that crashed into the sea trying to land on Tuk Island.
Authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airlines said they had six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were stable.
The cause of the crash and the sequence of events remain unknown.
The airlines and the U.S. Navy all announced that the plane had crashed into a coral reef just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was over the runway.
Mr. Bill Janes, an American passenger said the plane was low-aired.
"It was very good," said Mr. Janes.
Mr. Janes said he and others have reached the emergency exit of a plane that is sinking on its waist-up level.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and he was injured in the head.
The U.S. Navy has also announced that the seamen who were renovating the docks have also used an expanded boat to wrap the people up to shore and that they have joined in the rescue before the plane sinks about 100 feet (30 m).
According to the Air Security Network data, 111 people have been killed in the crash of a PNG airline in the last 20 years, but air niggins were not involved.
An analyst explains the time line of the night when a woman was burned alive.
In a retrial of a man accused of burning a living Mississippi woman in 2014, the prosecutor's office finally argued on Saturday.
US Justice analyst Paul Lawlet has testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He used his cell phone records to track her movements with the 29-year-old defendant Kinton Terris the day he died.
Loret said he received some cell phone data that indicated Terris was with him the night he died, which was contrary to Terris' previous testimony, and Clarion Ledger reported.
When he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if it was true that Terris was riding a truck in Sanford that night, Sanford testified that he was lying because his truck was in Nashville.
The fact that Terris met and said it was about two weeks when Chambers died contradicted him.
According to the cell phone records, we only met a week ago.
Mr. Lawlet said sometime after Chambers died, Terris removed the texts, phone calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from her life," said Hell.
The defendant will begin the final defense on Sunday.
The judge said after that day the hearing will be transferred to the jury's verdict.
The High Breed: What is rational hip hop?
Three hip hop players are trying to challenge the negative image of this genre with a positive message to music:
The Hih Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has turned away from its roots, such as its political message and its approach to social issues:
They want to get back to their roots and get back to Consyas hip-hop again.
Artists like Hoozies and Commons have seen the rise of the present in UK through artists like Akala and Loke.

A complaint against couples who fired after the racist text in New York City
A New York baby-sitter accused a couple of being fired racistly.
They called the suit an act of compulsion and denied being racist.
The mother of two children, Lindsey Páco-Flaxman, expressed her confusion when she learned that her new baby, Giselle Morris, was black when he arrived on the first day of work in 2016.
"No, black again" and "Psco Fluxman" texted their husbands.
But the text was sent to Mr. Mores twice.
According to the New York Post, Pisco-Fracksman fired Mr. Morris after he said that the African baby chaser who quit in the past was expected to be Filipino because of his poor work quality.
Maurice received a day's pay and returned home at Uber.
Morris now charges the couple with dismissal and asks for $350 or six months of compensation a day if they work in their original living quarters without a contract.
"I want to tell them that we can't do this, that she told them on Friday that she knew this was discrimination."
The couple denied the claim that they were racist and claimed that the dismissal was justified after they had made Morris uncomfortable.
"I don't think so."
She's not racist.
We are not racists. "My husband, Joel Pisco, told the post:
"But even if you were mistaken, could you leave your children with someone who was rude?"
Your newborn baby?
I can't do that.
To make the case look like a force, Pisco said she had only two weeks to give birth, and it was a very difficult situation.
"I'm sorry, sir," said Mr. Marvel.
So let's say that this is the investment bank.
While legal cases are going on, public opinion of the courts is rapidly spreading, couples are being blamed on social media, and their actions and logic are being confused.
Paddington Spacer, a new letter reveals that the bear that speaks to the bear has become unacceptable to its readers.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, told about the letter: “It’s hard to imagine someone's feelings before it's published.
Now, what we know about Paddington is a great success.
Before writing a book about her father, who worked as a BBC photographer, inspired by a little bear to write a book about him, he said that if he hadn't accepted work, he would have been optimistic, and that his 60-year anniversary last year after his death was "Bittersweet".
Speaking of Paddington as "part of our very important family," she added that he was quiet and proud of his ultimate success.
"He was very quiet, and he wasn't the one to brag about," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that I felt proud of him, as if he had done something.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
"I'm sorry, sir, but I'm sorry.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Niith's hospital, Louis Pasteur, where doctors treated her with a keen desire.
"It was very dangerous, and Nad had made many calls to tell her that she was not going to be able to save her, and said, "Ednan Lapers said,
"And Nad called and said she'd be dead in two minutes and she had to say good-bye.
And then I said, "Well, what's twelve?"
"I love you so much, sweetie."
I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.
The medication that the doctor gave her to stop her heart was slowly removed and her movements stopped.
She was already dead and this was all stopped.
I just sat there and saw what was happening.
I was surrounded by many family members and people, so I could not scream or cry.
I had to put up with all my efforts."
In the grief of losing her daughter, Ednan Lapeaus soon had to fly alongside other passengers and endure the situation.
"No one knew," she said.
"I fell down on my head, and tears were pouring down my eyes.
It’s hard to explain, but I felt this overwhelming empathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
He really loved his daughter.
The grieving women put cards on the bridge to prevent suicide.
Two women who lost their loved ones in suicide are working to prevent action to destroy their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys continue to put on the Wales Bridge a card with a message and a phone number that could give them support.
Mr. Davis' son, Tyler, suffered from depression when he was 13 and refused to take his own life at 18 years of age.
"I don't want every parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Davis, a 45-year-old woman living in Lidney, said her son was a lovely, promising chef:
Everyone knew he was smiling.
Everyone said his smile would light up in any room."
But he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Mr. Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, discovered the death of his brother.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm often worried about a chain of events."
Mr. Davis made a card. "Even if you're a friend, you want people to know that you have someone to talk to.
"Do not lie down in silence.
Mr. Davis and a few years old friend Mr. Humphreys lost her 15-year-old partner, Mr. Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being depressed, depressed, or depressed."
"We noticed a change in his attitude a few days before Christmas.
He was very depressed on Christmas Day when the children were opening the presents, and he looked at them and did nothing."
She said his death was a great trauma for the children, but it was the only way to get over it.
We've broken it apart.
But we all have to fight with this."

FBI, we've begun an investigation that will make the future of Brett Cavano unpredictable.
In his limited time and range, he thought that if we could actually get what he was looking for, we would be a little more united.
Why didn't Kabourung and his Republican supporters like the FBI's investigation?
All their hesitations are a matter of timing.
The middle elections are closing on November 6th, five weeks away, and if, as expected, the Republicans have failed, they will become very weak by the choice of a man who wants them to be elected to the Supreme Court of the United States.
George W. Bush called the senator one after the other to pressure him to support his wife, Ashley, who served as Mr. Kabano and Mr. Bush's secretary in the White House.
What happens after the FBI makes that report?
The vote will begin in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will sit.
Whether Mr. Cavano can win at least 50 votes in the Senate or not will still be difficult to see, which will mean that Vice President Mike Pens will be defeated and approved by the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defectors are down by the power of Kim.
South Korean legislation said the number of North Korean refugees has decreased since Kim Jong-un took over seven years ago.
Park Bjong, who quoted data from the Republic of Korea, says last year was 1,127 compared to the number of 2,706 North Koreans in 2011:
Park said the main cause was a stronger border control and high rate by immigration agents between North Korea and China.
Pyongyang has not published a public comment.
Many refugees from the north will be granted citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the beginning of the challenge war in 1953.
Many of them have the longest border between North Korea and China, which is more easily guarded by the unarmed region between South Korea (DMZ).
In China, refugees are often viewed as illegal immigrants and deported rather than refugees.
In fact, the relationship between the north and the south is still at war.
Earlier this month, two leaders met in Pyongyang to focus on the stagnant non-nuclear negotiations.
This took place after a massive agreement was made on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula at a historic June meeting of the President of Singapore, Donald Trump, and Kim Jongong.
But on Sunday, North Korea Foreign Minister Li Yong-ho condemned US sanctions that have not developed since.
"We are not sure of the security of our country without trust in the United States, and we will not step into denuclearization ourselves under such circumstances," said Li in a speech by the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Perosi spoke against Brett Cavano as being inappropriate for the "Hysteric" Supreme Court's duties.
Nancy Perrosi, executive director of the Minor Party of the House, described the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Cavano as a hysterical and said his disposition was inappropriate for obedience to the Supreme Court:
Perosi commented on Sunday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I can't help thinking that if a woman had this kind of attitude, she would be described as hysterical.
Cavano emotionally denied Dr. Christine Bresey Ford the charge that they had committed sexual assault when she was a Tineja:
During his statement, the Kabanu was very emotional, and at times it was about to scream and choke during his family and high school discussions.
He also spoke out strongly against the Democrats of the committee and called the case against himself a "frequency and coordained loss" by the liberals who were angry at the elections in 2016 in which Hilary Clinton was elected.
Perosi said she was convinced by the testimony of Kabanu that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because of his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I don't think so," said Mary. "I think he's not good at these statements and Clinton and the Democrats.
Perosi was in trouble when asked if he was going to shoot the Kabanu when it was approved, and whether the Democrats of the House would win the majority.
"If he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not fit not only in the Supreme Court but also in the courts he's currently engaged."
The Cavanos are now judges of the D.C. High Court.
As a Democrat, Pelosi is supposed to be a conservative trial, and she is concerned about the possibility that Kabanu will rule over the health insurance policy and the Law-Weid case.
Kabanu avoided the question of whether he was going to reverse a certain Supreme Court's decision in his approved hearing.
It's not the stage when a hysterical, prejudiced person goes to court and says, "Isn't that great?"
And women need to do it.
It's a reasonable and terrible accusation, and a flow of anger for months and years, and she can't take it away without crying.
"We cry when we're angry, Mr. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, but what do you think?
She went on to say: "I was so helped by some woman with an Executive, she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique when she started to cry, and she thinks I'm sad because I'm crying to someone she talks to."
I'm angry.
And she just keeps crying.
And I thought it was so great."
Tears are basically not understood, so they are recognized as an outlet for some of the anger.
There was one vivid memory of a man's superiority in his office, and when I was crying with a rage that I could not describe, an elderly woman who was a little afraid of a cold manager would grab her neck and drag her down the stairs.
"Don't show them any tears," she said to me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're grieving, and they're happy to let you down."
Patricia Schrader, a Democrat from Colorado, was working for Gary Hart's presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart realized that he was having an affair called Monkey Business and left the election, he was very unhappy and felt that there was no reason for him to have the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," she said, laughing 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing we need was one more candidate.
Someone called her "Snow White and Seven Small Men."
Because she's too late to start the campaign, and she's not going to run unless she collects $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
I found out that some of her supporters offered her a thousand dollars, while others offered her only 250 dollars.
"I don't think so," she said.
When she gave a speech that announced that she would not officially launch a campaign, many emotions – thanks to those who supported her, money, and a very difficult system for targeting voters instead of delegates – and anger over the lack of women’s dignity overwhelmed her.
"You must have thought my nerves were failing." Mr. Schroeder remembered how the press had reached her.
"Crenex must have thought it was my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what the words were written on my gravestone.
A crying bug?
And that's what it's all about.
While the trade wars between the United States and China are still far from ending, experts say that the gap between two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. president Donald Trump issued a warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest tax advance this week will affect the equivalent of 200 billion dollars (U.S.) worth of new tax, and will effectively tax half of the products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has retaliated in the same way each time, and recently they took 5 to 10 percent tax on US products of 60 billion dollars.
China has sworn against the United States each time, and the world's second largest economy is not going to move away immediately.
To surrender to Washington means to surrender, but to obey the US publicly is a great humiliation for China's Supreme Leader, Xiao Xingo.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing handled the card correctly, the pressure of the U.S. trade war could be a long-term positive support for China by reducing the dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that Washington or Beijing's early political decisions create economic turmoil in both countries is more dangerous than observers may have thought, "The study of America's security center in the Sink Tank, which focuses on Asia, says Abigail Grace of the Research Associator.
Minister of Foreign Affairs, I'm ready for the return of refugees.
Syria is ready to help rebuild a country that has been devastated by war for seven years.
According to the United Nations General Assembly, foreign minister Warrid al-Murem said the state has improved:
"Today's progress in the struggle against terrorism has made the situation more stable and safer on the ground," he said.
The government continues to repair areas that were destroyed by terrorists to restore normal health.
All situations are now being prepared for refugees who have to flee for terrorism, their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have been evacuated since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people still live in the country and need humanitarian support.
Al Muerem says the Syrian regime welcomes help in rebuilding a collapsed country:
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional support and support from countries that sponsor civil war.
Europe won the rider cup in Paris.
In Le Golf National, outside Paris, France, the European Union won the rider cup in 2018 with a final score of 16.5 to 0.5.
The United States has now recorded six consecutive defeats in Europe, and has not won the rider cup in Europe since 1993.
In Europe, a team of Danish captain Thomas Bjjön reached the 155 point necessary to strike down with the United States and restored the crown.
Phil Mikkelson, an American star who was stuck in most of the tournaments, dropped a tea shot into a pond at the 16th Hall of Par3 and recognized Francesco Molinari for his match.
The Italian Golfer, Molina, is shining on all his rounds, and one out of four players is playing for the current format of the tournament, which started in 1979.
America's Jordan Scull has lost five and four in the top players of the European team, Turbjon Alsen, Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, would have played two and one in the final game of the rider cup, and dropped it to Ian Paulter in England.
The veterans, Sergei García, who served eight-time rider cups, became the most successful in Europe in the tournament at 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I don't have much to do today.
It's been a very hard year.
And I'm going to show you how to do that.
I'm very happy to be able to get my cup back.
It's a team, and I'm very happy to be able to contribute.
He's an American golf legend and gave baton to John Lamb, who broke the American golf legend at two and one in a Sunday single.
"I have an incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up looking at him.
Woods lost in every match in France, and recorded his 13-21-3 career in the record of the rider cup.
The weird statistics of one brilliant player, who won 14 major titles, are limited to Jack Niclass.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, Tony Finnau, who was playing high quality during the tournament, the United States team was struggling to find a fairway during the weekend.
America's captain, Jim Frook, spoke after his team's unfortunate performance.
We discussed Europe this morning.
We fought.
Let's honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
So let's say that he played 12 players.
We're going to start a team again, work together with the PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee in the United States, and move forward.
I'm very proud to be a captain.
You have to throw away your hat.
We have been defeated."
