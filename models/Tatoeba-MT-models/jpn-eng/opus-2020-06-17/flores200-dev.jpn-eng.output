A 30-year-old husband from Buffalo was one of the four who died in a shootout, but his wife was not injured.
He is a well-known but controversial English tutor, and he is a lecturer at Modern Education and King's Grory, and he claims to have had 9,000 students at his peak.
In his manual, he says that some of his parents were using a word that they considered vulgar, and in their class, they were talking blasphemously.
Modern Edocation accused him of printing a big ad on a bus without permission and of lying that he was the head of an English teacher.
He was accused before of defamation, but he was not charged.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
In the last 30 years, China has developed a market economy despite the fact that it remains officially a communist state.
The first economic reform was under Xiaoping's guidance.
China has grown to 90 times its economy since then.
Last year, China was the first car exporter to outnumber Germany and the largest market in industry in the United States.
So let's say that we're talking about GDP.
The fourth known tropical storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, Daniel, was formed in the eastern part of the Atlantic.
The storm is about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, with a maximum of 40 miles per hour.
And so, according to scientists at the National Hurricane Center, Daniel will continue to grow and become a hurricane by Wednesday.
The storm is so far away from land, it continues to be difficult to evaluate its potential impact on the United States and the Caribbean.
Bokk was born in Croatia's capital, Zaire, when he was active in Parchzan8grad.
I joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
He played 468 games during his stay and recorded 403 goals.
So let's look at the number of places in this club.
In 1995, he was elected the best in the history of Partisan.
The celebration began with a special show by the world's famous silk du Soleil.
Then came the National Symphony of Istanbul, the Janisari band, the singers Fatihi Elkoch and Mousulm Gurses.
And then the choir came on stage.
Turkish singer Sesen-Aqs played with Italian Tenor singer Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Harris Alexiu.
Finally, the Turkish dance team Fire of Anatoria presented "Troi".
A 13-year-old motorcycle driver, Peter Rentz, was killed in an accident in Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
Lenz fell off his bike while warming up and was attacked by his companion, Javier Zayat.
He was immediately taken to a local hospital and then died.
Mr. Zayat was intact in this accident.
He continued: "The financial system is an important part of the economy."
"A year's financial crisis has become the most serious in the last two months, but I think the financial market is starting to recover."
Last week, Nathan News announced that starting three new broadcasts will greatly increase international language assignments for news coverage.
This global organization, already in English and Japanese, is about to launch a program for television, web, mobile devices in Spanish, Italian, and Korean.
Fortunately, I did not experience any damage, but I saw the ominous sight of people trying to step out the window.
The people were knocking on their chairs trying to break the window, but the windows didn't break.
"One of the windows finally broke and started to escape through the window," said survivor Francischek Kowalski.
The reason why stars produce light and heat is because the hydrogen atoms combine to form more heavy elements.
And that's what we're trying to do.
But it's going to be very difficult to solve, and it'll take years to build a practical fusion reactor.
It's like a steel needle or something like that.
So this is the same thing as the surface tension.
So this is what happens when you put a needle on the surface of the water.
The blade on modern ice skates is made up of two edges and a hollow in between.
The base of the blade is slightly curved, so if the blade leans on one side or the other side, the edges that are in contact with the ice also bend.
So, if you're on the right side, you're on the left, you're on the right, you're on the right, you're on the left, you're on the right, you're on the right, you're on the right, you're on the right, you're on the right, you're on the right, you're on the right, you're on the right.
So, we're going to have to get rid of all of the extra energy that we've got from the light to get back to the former energy phase.
It's the release of a tiny particle of light called the photon.
This process, which scientists call radiation stimulating, is because atoms are inspired by bright light to release particles of light, and light is a form of radiation.
The next picture shows an atom releasing light.
It's a little bit smaller than the material that makes up the atom!
So, if you're using a light bulb for hundreds of hours, you're going to end up burning the fire bulb, and the light bulb is not going to light.
So we have to change the light bulb, so we need to change the light bulb.
So let's start with a few examples.
This is because when a part of a light bulb is in a socket, when you touch a socket or a metal part of a light bulb, it can generate a powerful current from a socket that is touched by the metal part of a light bulb.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart.
The smallest tube is called the capillary vessel, and the blood is pumped from the heart through the heart, which is called the artery, and then it returns to the heart.
The teeth of Triceratops could crush not only leaves but also hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that Triceratops ate sotite plants that were common in the early '80s.
These plants have sharp, sharp cones, and they look like palm-like lowwoods.
So, if you look at the tree trunk, you'll see that Triceratops is a tree trunk, and it's a tree trunk.
Other scientists argue that these plants are highly toxic, so that even though animals like the sloth and the parrot can eat poisonous leaves and fruits today, no dinosaur could eat them.
How does the gravity of io go?
If you weigh 200 pounds on the Earth, you're going to weigh about 36 pounds on Io.
The Sun has no crust (or human place) like the earth.
So let's think about it.
It's called the sphere of light.
In 1610, about 3,000 years later, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei observed with a telescope, and discovered that Venus was as fragile as the moon.
And so, this is what happens when we look at Venus, which is the height of Venus, only because the side of Venus (or the moon) is bright on the sun.
And then, a few years later, in 1639, British astronomer Jeremy Hollocks observed the passage of Venus.
England had a long period of peace after conquering Danelo again.
But in 1991, Ethelread faced a massive pirate fleet from Gutlem, 100 years ago.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trigvasson, a Norwegian whose ambition to regain his country from Danish rule.
After his first military setback, Eserred came to an agreement with Olaf.
Hankul is the only letter used in everyday life.
King Sejong is the fourth king of the Korean dynasty and one of the most respected.
It's called "the proper sound for the people's guidance."
There are a lot of theories about how the Sandkrit language came about, one of which was that the Aryans came from the West and brought their languages to India.
This is an ancient language, and it's a Latin word for Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in the Sunscrit language.
This language is a very complex and rich language, just as Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish, it is the origin of many modern Indian languages.
The war against France was over, and Germany began to prepare for the invasion of Britain.
Germany gave this attack a code called Operation Sealion.
But the British Navy was much stronger than the German navy at the time, and was able to defeat any invasion fleet that was sent across the Channel of England.
The Admirals, however, were afraid that German air strikes would sink them, so the British Navy ships rarely had a base near the route of the invasion.
Let me start with Italy's plan.
Even though he built four new ships just before the war, he was weak in the land navy.
The main target of Italy was the African countries.
To do that, we had to eliminate British bases and ships in Egypt.
Japan was the same island country as Britain.
It's a long-term dive.
The submarine was used in World War I and World War II.
Although there were a lot of sea travel at the beginning of the war, with the development and accuracy of radar, submarines were forced to go underwater.
The Germans were very good at the navigation and manipulation of the submarines.
Germany, which was successful in submarines, was no longer trusted enough to hold many ships after the war.
The king of Tutankhamen is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt.
Interestingly, he is not highly esteemed in ancient times, and most ancient kings have no record.
But the discovery of the tomb in 1922 made this young king famous.
Most of the items buried with the Tutankhamen were preserved in good condition, and thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
With the invention of the Spoke wheel, the Assyrian war chariots were ready to be light, fast, powerful, and run out of soldiers and tanks in other countries.
The arrow that was released from the terrible crossbow went through the armor of the enemy.
The cavalry was an army that would fight on horses, and the horses were not invented at that time, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare back of horses.
There are many well-known Greek politicians, scientists, artists, and perhaps the most famous bearers of this ancient culture are the legendary blind poet Homer, who composed the two greatest works of Greek literature, Ilias and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristotenes are still popular drama writers, and their plays have been described as the greatest literary masterpieces of world literature.
Another famous Greek mathematician, Pythagoras, is known for finding a famous theorem about the relationship of the right triangle to the side of the right-hand triangle.
There are many ways to estimate the number of people who speak Hindi.
The number of native speakers depends on whether or not you put a very close language into the number.
It is estimated that 340 million to 500 million people speak this language and 800 million people understand it.
In everyday conversation, people who speak a different language can usually communicate with one another.
In the 15th century, Northern Estonia was largely influenced by German culture.
Some German monks wanted to keep God close to the local people and invented the Estonian language.
So here's what we're going to do.
As time went on, many words borrowed from German were fused.
We're not going to be able to do that.
But Charles went to Trinity College at Cambridge University, majored in anthropologists and archeology, and later he studied history, and he got two:2(2nd degree).
Charles is the first person to get a degree in the Royal Court of England.
Turkey on the other side of the Balkans (East Thrace or Lumeria) makes up 3% of the country.
This is a rectangle. This is a rectangle.
So, if you look at Turkey, the area of Turkey, including the lake, is 783,562 kilometers, or 300,948 square miles, and then you see South Asia is 755,688 miles (229,733 square miles), and Europe is 23,764 km (2,174 square miles).
It's about the same size as the French mainland and the British.
Turkey is a country surrounded by three seas: in the west is the Aegean Sea, in the north is the Black Sea, and in the south is the Mediterranean Sea.
It's a country that has a long history, but independence goes back to 1839.
It's a little bit more complicated than that, but it's a little bit more complicated.
Luxembourg was always trying to defend its position as a neutral, but it was occupied by Germany in World War I and in World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became the founder of the current European Union.
Dulgarson is a ruins fortress and Buddhist temple on the high ground of the district of Parro.
It is said that in 1649, Shabudun Gawan Namgel built this fortress in memory of his victory against the Tibetan-Mongol army.
Most of the fire in 1951 burned down, leaving only part of Durgarzon site, including the picture of Jabduung Gwan Namgel.
The post-fire fortress is preserved and protected, and is now one of the tourist attractions in Bhutan.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was in a difficult position between two powerful neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia many times during the 18th century, and destroyed Punfen in 1772.
In the late 18th century, Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
This is what we're going to talk about in the next video.
Two-thirds of Venezuela's workers are in service, and nearly one-fourth of them are in agriculture.
Despite the fact that oil is an important industry for Venezuela and only 1% of the people in the oil industry, the country is a pure exporter.
The island was transformed into a tropical garden city.
In 1981, Banda Miss Joachim, a hybrid of orchids, was chosen as a national flower.
By October, close to 1.5 million herbivores migrate from the northern hills to the southern plains in search of rain.
And then we go north through the west, and after the rainy season of April, we cross the river Mala again.
The Serengeti region includes Serengeti National Parks, Ngorongoro and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania, and Masaimala National Reserve in Kenya.
In addition to traditional skills and traditional skills, we're going to need tools that we've learned in interactive classrooms (singboarding, audio and video editing, story-telling, etc.) to learn to produce interactive media.
So, we're going to be able to do this in a few minutes.
In interactive design, not only does it require the components of the project to connect with each other, but it also requires that they mean separate entities.
So, here's what we're going to do in this video.
So, this is not a problem, this is not a problem.
And so, we're going to use the zoom lens to measure the focal length of the lens.
So this is one of the disadvantages of zoom lensing.
So, the light is very low, and the light is very low.
So, this is one of the most common problems with trying to convert a film to DVD format.
And it's a great way to get people to think about it.
So, we're going to look at this in a different way.
So, here's what we're going to do in the next video.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD yourself, it's very likely that the boundaries will be cut, and the subtitles will not be fully visible.
The traditional medieval castles are abrasive of the imagination of men for a long time, and make them a spear game, a banquet, and the appearance of a knight of King Arthur.
Just standing among a thousand-year-old ruins of i, the sounds of battles and smells of battles of a long time ago, and the sounds of a cranium, the smell of fear in the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why was the castle built in the first place?
The typical castle of this age, Kirby MacSlaw, creates a more fortified house than a castle.
Its huge glass windows and thin walls would not have been able to resist a long and determined attack.
Back in the 1480s, when the construction of Lord Hastings began, the country was relatively peaceful, and the defense was required only to protect it against a small band of wandering attackers.
The power balance was an institution for European nations to maintain national sovereignty across Europe.
The concept was that governments in Europe often maintain balance while changing alliances in order to prevent a country from becoming stronger.
The Spanish succession war was the first war to take place in Europe, with its power balance at the center.
This is a significant change, because the major European countries no longer have an excuse for a religious war.
The temple of Artemis, in Ephesus, was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C.E. by the fire of Herostratus.
His motive, according to his story, was to gain fame, and the angry inhabitants of Ephesus announced that they would never record the names of Herostratus.
It is now known to us because the Greek historian Strabo later wrote his name.
Alexander offered to fund the rebuilding of the temple as king, but it was not accepted.
Let's try to keep our hands as relaxed as possible while playing exactly the notes.
This makes it easier for you to get tired and not have to hit the keyboard with force to get the volume out like a piano.
To increase the volume when playing the accordion, press the skin hard or faster.
So, what we're going to talk about today is the idea of mystery, which is a philosophical idea of ultimate reality, of godliness, of spiritual truth, of communication with God, of identity, or of conscious consciousness.
The faithful seek God's reality, godship, direct experience, intuition, or insight.
The believers seek a way of life and experience.
In this way, we can distinguish from other forms of religious belief and worship, especially by focusing on personal experiences, such as peaceful, insight, bliss, or ecstasy.
Sikhism is a religion derived from the Indian subcontinent.
Sikhs respect Hindu roots and traditions, but consider their faith a separate religion from Hindus.
And so, this is what the Sikhs call their religion Gurmatt, which means "the Church's Way," which means "The Father's Way" in Punjabi, which is a common aspect of all Indian religions.
Sikhism was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak, 1469-1539.
But in June 1956, workers protesting food shortages and wage reductions in Poland rioted, and when it turned into a public protest against Communism, Kuroscheov's commitment was put to the test.
In the end, Kruzchev sent tanks to restore order, but he gave way to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Prime Minister Vlazislav Rubarka.
The Indus Valley civilization was the Bronze Age civilization of the North West Indian subcontinent.
This civilization flourished in the banks of the Indus River and came from its name.
Some scholars have assumed that civilization existed along the banks of the now dry Salavati, and it is appropriate to call it the Indus Salvati civilization.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire has helped the progress of medicine.
This was the first time that the physician was recruited by Emperor Augustus and formed the first Roman medical unit to be used in the aftermath of the war.
They had all kinds of sedatives, including morphine and scopolamine extracted from the seeds of the poppie.
They were also familiar with the removal of limbs to save patients from anthrax, the tourniquets to stop blood flow, and the arteriosclerosis.
The Roman Empire has profited greatly in the field of medicine over the centuries, producing much of the knowledge we have today.
So let's take a look at this.
In the 1970's, John Smith developed this technology for people who have less experience in paper and less skilled at it.
From a very early age, children develop a sense of racial and racial stereotypes, and these stereotypes affect their behavior.
For example, a child who learns the traditional concept of failure in school and who shares himself with a minority group of children tend to fail at school when he learns the established concepts about his own race.
MySpace, the third most popular website in the United States, currently has 54 million profiles.
And we're going to talk about this in a few minutes, and we're going to talk about this in a few minutes.
So, I'm going to show you a couple of examples of what I'm going to show you in this video, and I'm going to show you a couple of examples of what I'm going to show you in this video.
This page is easy to access by simply typing a web address, which is easy for students who have difficulty with keyboard use and complex spelling, and it's easy for them to remember and it's easy to type.
So let's see if we can do that.
So, we're going to talk about a lack of attention disorder, which is a neuro-tonic syndrome, and its classic definition is three symptoms of impulse, distraction, multi-tasking or energy-intensive.
It's not an educational learning disability, it's a medical learning disorder that affects about 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps 2 million American children.
So, if you're a child with ADD, it's hard to concentrate on school studies, but it's fun to focus on games, watching cartoons, writing non-descriptal texts.
They tend to get into a variety of trouble by trying to stimulate the brain in ways that are not normally stimulated.
ADD affects their relationship with their peers, because children with ADD behave that way, spell that way, and understand why other children are different in maturity.
The more we learn, the more we learn, the more we learn.
And so we had a different approach to getting information, and the pressure inside the individual was not recalled, and the ability to remember the text was focused on it.
And that's what we're going to talk about in this video.
Unlike other primates, human beings are no longer able to move, carry weight, or pass through trees.
So, here's an example.
The human hand is shorter than the toe, and the toe is straight.
And this is what we're going to see in the next video.
Some think it can be very exhausting to experience too many artificially guided dreams.
The main reason why this phenomenon occurs is as a result of a temporary delay in REM sleep.
If you lose sleep, you lose sleep at night, and this condition where you experience real sleep and your body recovers becomes less frequent, as it turns out.
It's as tired as waking up every 20 or 30 minutes watching TV.
This effect depends on the number of times the brain tries to dream clearly overnight.
The situation was not very good for the Italian army in North Africa, and within a week of the Italian proclamation of war on June 10, 1940, the 11th Hussar army occupied the Captuzzo fortress in Libya.
The British ambushed him east of Bardia and captured General Rastuch, commander of Italy's 10th army.
On June 28, the governor of Libya and considered to be the successor of Mussolini, Itharo Balbo, died in a shooting by his comrades while landing in Tobroke.
And this is what we're going to talk about in the next video.
This sport is played by two players against each other, and both of them fight with swords.
So let's go back to the game of golf.
In the normal round, the player starts at the first floor of the course and ends at the 18th floor.
So let's look at the number of players who finish the course with the smallest number of strokes or club swings.
The game is played on the lawn, the grass around the hall is cut short and called green.
So, what is the most common form of tourism that most people associate with travel?
This is when people go to places that are completely different from their daily lives and they feel like they're having fun.
The beach, theme park, and campgrounds are the most common places to visit tourists.
If the purpose of a particular place is to know the history and culture of a particular place, that kind of tourism is called cultural tourism.
So, in this video, we're going to talk about how tourists can visit different landmarks in one country or concentrate only on one region.
The residents who saw the campaign also called for reinforcements.
The forces that would reinforce the front posts were the New Hampshire 1st and 3rd Regiment, composed of 200 men under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (who will be later generals).
Stark soldiers set up on the north side fence of the camp.
At low tide, they opened a gap along the Misstick River along the northeast side of the peninsula, and without hesitation, they extended the fence with a low stone fence up to the north end of a narrow coast.
The gridry or the Starks put a stake at about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the outer fence and ordered that no one fire until the regular army passed through it.
The US plan was to start a cooperative attack in three different directions.
General John Khadwald has launched a diversional attack against the British camp in Bodentown to prevent enemy reinforcements.
General James Ewing took 700 of his men across the river on the Torenton siding ship, took the bridge that lay on Asan pink Creek, and stopped the enemy from escaping.
The 2400 major strike force crossed the river at nine miles north of Trenton, divided into two units under Green and Sullivan, and launched an attack before dawn.
If you move from the quarter marathon to the half marathon, the speed is much less important, and you will have to have absolute endurance.
So let's say that we have a 1.
The best way to prepare for the running season is to go to the gym and train half of you to cross-country in the winter.
It's not just nutritional therapy that grows in the top players, but nutrition intake can have a profound impact on the health of young athletes.
It's good to maintain a healthy energy balance, to practice an effective water supply system, to understand various practical aspects of supplements, to improve performance and to promote sports.
It's a relatively cheap sport, but it's often misunderstood that you don't have the necessary equipment to participate.
We can buy products if we need them, but there are few products that affect performance.
So, let's look at some examples of athletes.
So we can think of an atom as one of the basic components of all matter.
This is a very complex object, and according to a simplified Boa model, it resembles a planet around the sun, with its core orbiting by electrons.
The nucleus is made up of two particles, the neutrons and the protons.
The electron has a positive charge, the neutron has no charge, and the electron is a negative charge.
To protect the victim, we need to look into the crime scene first and make sure it's safe.
We need to get close to the victim's location and the unconscious danger signal.
If you get hurt trying to help, you only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and catastrophe were involved in the relationship between back pain and disability.
It's not just depression or fear, but the effect of catastrophes is the condition of the week's structured PPA session.
Those who participated in regular activities needed more support to distinguish the negative perception of pain from the discomfort caused by chronic pain and normal physical exercise.
So, what we're going to do is we're going to look at the visual, the visual, the visual, the sensory, the visual.
So, what we're going to do is we're going to look at the structure of the eye, depending on the requirements of the organism, from very simple to very complex.
The different structures have different functions, different wavelengths of light, different vision.
So, here's what I'm going to talk about.
So, if all of the individual members of a group are identical in certain representations, they're called singleness.
And this is called a multiplicity, because when an individual appears as a variable with a certain trait, they are called a multi-type.
This is the same thing as two-thirds of an ant.
In the desert stage, army ants move in formation at night and camp during the day.
In the colonies, when the available food is reduced, they start to do so.
This kind of action and march will continue for about 17 days.
So, what is cell?
The cell is the base unit of the body of every living thing.
It's called the building blocks of life.
So, the nervous system, the nervous system, maintains normality by sending neural impulses out of the body to keep blood flow.
These nerve impulses are sent very quickly to the entire body and can help to protect you from potential threats.
The tornado can take place in a narrower area than other storms, but it can destroy everything on the road.
The tornado takes down the trees, rips off the roofs and walls from the building, rolls the car into the air.
These monster storms make up the maximum wind speed of 480 kilometers per hour (433 meters per second).
And that's what we're going to see in this video.
But the first real-time telescope was created in Europe in the late 16th century.
So, these telescopes are a combination of two lenses that allow us to zoom in and see distant objects in close proximity.
Greed and selfishness are always close to each other, but the essence of cooperation is that when the majority profit, they can always profit in a short time by acting selfishly.
And hopefully, most people will realize that the best option for the long term is to cooperate with each other.
Many people dream of a day when humans can travel to another planet and explore another world.
But even if that happens, it probably won't last that long.
Maybe your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great, great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great
So, if you look at an animal, it's made up of a bunch of cells, and it's digested in its body.
It's the only animal that has a brain.
The animals live in every part of the earth.
So, what's going on here?
So let's look at the cells.
And this is what we're going to see in the next video.
So, this is what we're going to see in the next video.
And he looked like he was the first person to see dead cells.
So, if we move from one state to another, the elements and compounds don't change.
Now, as a gas, nitrogen has the same properties as liquid nitrogen.
Water is a compound made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
So it's not going to change the structure of the molecules.
So, this is a little bit more complicated than this.
We're going to talk about time and time.
And that's what we're going to talk about in this video.
We experience time as a series of events from the future to the present.
So let's think about how long it takes to measure the duration of an event.
So, by observing the repetitions of periodic events, we can mark the duration of time ourselves.
And this is what we're going to talk about today.
So, we're going to be able to produce high-level animations on computers, and more and more of them are being broadcast on television and in movies.
In many cases, music is recorded on high-powered computers.
From the 19th to the 20th century, New Zealand was the first indigenous population to be settled in New Zealand.
It was established that the Maoris then migrated from Polynesia in a large fleet and took New Zealand from the Moorians and established a farming society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Mooroli are a native Maori population that has migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and have developed its own peaceful culture.
Chatham also lived in another tribe that moved from New Zealand, and it was Maori.
They called themselves Moori, and there was a few competitions, until they were wiped out.
We've been working with individuals for decades to help us appreciate our strengths and passions, even though we've clearly appreciated our difficulties and failures.
And as we're talking about individuals, families and organizations, we've gained valuable insights into people who have influenced their past history and the culture of their organizations.
You don't understand culture just because you know your own history, but at least it helps you to understand your position within the scope of the history of the organization.
As individuals and participants learn more about the values, the mission and the power of the organization, as they evaluate success and realize that they are failing.
In this example, remembering our past actions as entrepreneurs and the outcome of our success has helped people to accept new changes and new orientations in the local church.
So, we're going to talk about success, and we're going to talk about success, and we're going to talk about success.
So, what we're going to do is, we're going to look for a way to solve this problem.
The focus of this mind set is on speed, logic and accuracy, on identifying facts, on re-application of existing techniques, and on collecting information.
And one of the most important elements of this thinking is that there's only one right answer.
So, we're going to talk about this in the next video.
And this is the kind of person who has the ability to think logically, to remember patterns, to solve problems, to tackle scientific tests.
Humans are the best species in the world when it comes to reading the minds of others.
I mean, we can predict what people other than ourselves know, what they think, what they believe, what they know, what they want.
It's very important to understand the intentions of others among these abilities.
If you see someone breaking the window, you think they're trying to steal someone else's car.
If you're trying to get into your own car, you're going to have to make another decision.

And this is how the magnetic field and radio waves interact with atoms that emit tiny radio waves.
In 1970, Dr. Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and researcher, discovered the basis for using magnetic synesthesia as an instrument for medical diagnosis.
