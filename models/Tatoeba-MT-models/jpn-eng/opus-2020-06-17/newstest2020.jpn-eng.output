Driving with high heels is dangerous!
A young man's pedal has been misinformed in a number of accidents (Auto Message Web) - Yahoo! News!
It's a violation of the law of road travel.
While more and more reports of accidental accidents such as pedaling have been published, it’s a big mistake to assume that it’s only about older drivers.
The number of misdiagnosed pedals (1915) has more than 1032 accidents, with 1080 more ages under 24 years of age.
It is important to call the same attention to the elderly.
Do you want to take the leather off your feet?
Do you want to be safe?
The data does not contain gender ratios or causes, but unlike older people who are likely to come from physical declines such as driving skills and reflexes.
Among other things, women choose their shoes by their heels, pans, sandals, mulls, and that day’s dress, and they drive.
Some people who know it's not right to drive and who don't know how to change it have a problem.
However, high heels and sandal driving violates road law.
One is to ensure control of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, and Article 70, "Do not drive in such a way as to harm a person in an accident."
The other is Article 71 of the Public Security Commission of each municipality, which says that the driver must abide by what is set out to be done, such as the law of Miyazaki's road traffic law, which says, "The driver is wearing a pair of 12th slunks, a pair of slippers, a pair of shoes that prevent high heels and other drivers from driving, or in a manner that prevents him from driving, and not driving a vehicle."
The same is true of each municipality, whether it’s high heels or not.
So let's say I have a high-heeled car.
It's clear to me the basics of safe pedaling.
For safe and secure pedal operations, the heel is fixed to the floor first, the foot to be vertical against the brake pedal, and the foot to the right of the foot when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
It's important to make sure that you don't bend your heels at this time, regardless of the car's behavior.
But the fact that the heels are small, the heels are small and the floor is bordered to the floor, and the whole leg is at the height of the heel, so that the area at the foot is small and the foot on the pedal is not strong enough, and the slight adjustments are difficult to make.
I think this could be dangerous.
Most cars have floor carpets, but the material is easily caught on the heels of high heels, the heels are caught on the brakes, or the heels on the heels are taken off and the heels are stuck behind the pedal.
There are also cases where the heels are stuck behind the pedal and the accelerator is not returned.
We're going to develop a joint development such as a new AWD car or 86/BRZ model (responsor) - Yahoo news!
Toyota car and SUBAR-U agreed on a new business capital partnership on September 27.
So let's look at some examples.
Since their agreement with a business partnership in 2005, they have been working together to produce the Toyota train receipts from Subar, to supply cars from Toyota to Sbal, and to develop a joint development of the FR sports car ‘86,’ ‘BRZ’.
In June of this year, they have agreed to take advantage of the AWD technology in Subal and the power-powered Toyota technology and to work on an EV-only platform and the development of an EV vehicle.
This is the business capital agreement where the Toyota gets additional stock.
So let's say that this is the stock of the stock of the stock.
Sbal will be a company associated with Toyota's system.
So, if you want to buy a stock, you have to buy a share.
The two companies have developed and strengthened partnerships through their business capital partnerships.
And so we're going to go forward with the AWD model, the joint development of the 86/BRZ model, the spread of THS (toytag hybrid systems) to the car, cooperation in the connective area, and technological cooperation in the auto driving field.
U.S., refugees at their lowest level for three years in a row,
The U.S. Department of State announced on the 26th day, 2020 Abbreviated Year of September, that the number of refugees received from around the world would be reduced to 8,000.
The refugee law has been established to update the minimum number of people in three consecutive years since 980.
The card regime is going to vote next year for the presidential election and is going to present strict immigration and refugee policies to the conservatives.

The Ministry of Health says, "Do not increase the price without a reason."

He took over from Helikopoter landing to the tip of the island, and Ostrich took over from the midpoint to the docks.

This fire started on the 22nd day of Candai Island, Chamsondan.

The fire at the Hirzan is going to go around the river of Inchoon, the Coyang, the Skunhara, etc.
Ejima's flame will burn as a spark this month in Seoul Square, this month after it joins with a special spark in the island of Imjingaku (Malad).

In the beginning, I started my business as a brickmaker, a field industry in Toyoshima, Mihara County.
In October 1986, as they took over the conglomeration of the company and the business of the company, they transferred the main store to the current market.

In December of 2004, they built a large business base in the center of Western Japan, such as a big housemaker, a building shop, and a roofer.
He had the reputation of being the top brick maker of Toyoshima.
However, during the past year, prices have dropped to about 1.350 million dollars in December of 2018, due to the low housing situation since the Lehman Shock, and the frequent earthquake in Japan and the Bearmoto earthquake.
In addition to the low rate of profits associated with the rise in fuel prices, the deficit was a stringent deficit with surplus and equipment investment.
For this reason, even though they were trying to rebuild their operations, such as calling for financial institutions to pay off their loans, the business is slowly losing its promise of recovery.
When I came here and couldn't hold it up, it was the action.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it's expected to be about two billion dollars.

The apartment of the Kaposu house, even when the power is out, will be filled with water.
The total power outage (Blackout) associated with the September earthquake is being taken care of in an apartment in a desalination building.
According to the city's Aquaculture Agency, seven apartment buildings have been installed for the year after the earthquake and have been able to produce water even when the power is out.
There are about 400 more apartments and private homes in the city, which are flooded with water in the "water tank" when power outages are out.
There are two main ways of providing water: a water tank in a water tank in the basement and on the roof, and a direct access to each door through the city's water mains.
If the water pipes are not damaged, when the power pumps that pump water from the drain to each door are no longer powered by power outages, the water will be cut off, and every door will be dehydrated.

Is the word "beauty and abomination" a piece of paper?
The image of a "sharmic" is one of many beautiful girls of your work.
Is there a common sense between a mysterious beauty and a shadowy face?
It was released in August of the 1950s, in the collection of the pretty girls, who are known to be the first of the horror comic books, and who focus on the beauty of the teacher's paintings.
So, when you're looking at it, you're looking at it and you're looking at it.
What's so attractive about shadow?
The beautiful girls of your work (five)
In the introduction to "The Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a passage that said, "The horror, the uglyness, the shocking scenes and the expansion of their stories stand out in the extreme, but the contrast between their beautiful faces and their lustful faces... may be more pronounced.
So, here's an example of this: in a lot of the works, there are words, "survey" and "surprising creatures," but by the eye, the snake can be viewed as a creature, and it can be received by people who feel "beauty."
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
So, by the way, by the way, by the viewer's perception of beauty and the uglyness of the beast, the snake might be the one that's behind it.
This creature is also venerated as a higher spirit creature, and the home where the White Snake resides is considered a good luck.
I'm going to show you some of the pictures that I'm going to show you in this video, and I'm going to show you some of the pictures that I'm going to show you in this video.
It's a pretty girl with a shadow.
I'm going to call it the "Cool Bite" type, if you're not familiar with it, but I think it's something that's in common with all the beautiful girls in the drawing.
The main character of "Sunday," which was a series of weekly editions from 1969 to 1969, is "Sunday," a beautiful girl character representing the works of the paintings.

According to studies by NPO lawmen and others, this year around 3700 sites have been active throughout the country.
In Fukui province, there are 24 more than nine last year.
I don't know why we're at the children's diner right now.
Yuasa Yuasa, the director and social activist of the NPO law, told the background and meaning of a conference held in Sakai City:
Old age makes the area lonely, business districts down.
There's no place for people to meet.
So, "there was a need for a community of people and people to interact with each other."
It's a "multiple exchange" where old people and children join in.
Not only do they eliminate the hungry, but they also contribute to child support and the health of the elderly.
Breaking the cycle of poverty and improving the community.
"Don't make a child out of it."
From the lunar month to the daily meal.

It's fascinating how low a place like that is.
It's just, it's hard to get a running staff.
I've heard about some of the issues that I've been working on.
However, "relationship with a lot of people changes values," Yuasa-san says, "Environment becomes a safety net in dealing with a disaster."
It's like a light of hope in a closed society.

The real killer who droned Saudi oil facilities.
"The Iranian drone "Ababier" that was used in the bombing has been greatly improved by analyzing U.S. drones that have been destroyed in recent years.
It's cheaper to produce, and it's about 1,000 kilometers long.
It's also tough to get caught by radar because it's flying low.
On September 14, 10 military drones bombed the largest oil company in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Lumco.
Just after this, the Yemeni anti-government group Husi has issued a statement.
"It is obvious that behind the Husi is Iran, led by President Rouhani, who is not allowed to profit from the oil from the enemy Saudi Arabia in a situation where the country cannot export crude oil.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and the oil price was 15% higher.
Some say the oil shock is coming again.

It's not uncommon now for companies to use their products to advertise their products, but there are companies that have started a rare process called "Joyr hires" that they hire as their own employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMX), which is the main business of the company's CRM.
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I've talked to Mr. Kobayashi, who is the director of DmMiX, and this time is also the leader of the company and staff first that YouTuber adopted.
I want to support the youth who's working on YouTuber.
- How does it work in the first place?
Kunihito Kobayashi: The job of YouTuber has become the envy of many young people.
And we're going to see more and more young people coming to the top of our career rankings.
So far, the company has adopted and supported young people who are chasing the dream of bandmen and jokers.
So we're going to do a lot of research on how to do that.
- There's an image of an individual doing a video post on his own, but why did you decide to adopt it?
Kobayashi: While many young people long for a career called YouTuber, most YouTuber have the reality that they can't make the kind of revenue they think they are.
There's not a lot of creators who are doing videos and posts while they work and don't recognize the existence of YouTuber to their families.
In this project, we're going to provide the creators with an environment for their salary and content production.
I'm going to support the company's initiative by supporting the de facto benefits of YouTuber, which at first is in a very unstable position.

"I hope South Korea will return to GSOMIA" - Yahoo! News
The deputy secretary of state in the United States, Napper, responded to a private interview of the US Ambassador's House in the city and said, "I hope Korea will reconsider its decision to re-assemble the decision."
It is not uncommon for U.S. officials to refer to the GSOMIA re-examination.
GSOMIA is a platform for Japanese-Americans to connect and share their missile-burning information.
South Korea will inform Japan that the agreement will be broken in August, and if it expires, the framework will be broken to protect military information in Korea.
Napper argues that the crisis cannot be handled effectively without GSOMIA.
He urged South Korea to return.
He also said it was the first time in the history of U.S. Republic of Korea, which shares values such as democracy and human rights, that was also a threat to the United States.
The decline in Japan's relations today is a "danger to the national interests of the United States."
He said, "I have no intention of communicating with you," but he said, "I have a positive role to play so that you can fill the gap."
I'm sorry.

Since June, I've been using my job to paint warm, water-colored pictures of "0 scenes and drawing materials."
We're also going to use Japanese for traditional crafts that are breathing in the city, and we're going to make a cover for the book in Japanese.

The Fukui newspaper is reporting, and the Fukui Bank is helping to support itself.
We can donate from the crowdfunding site Lady For.

Tokita also controls JapanOP.
From May to May, the games will be the Sdiman Cup (May/ China), Indonesia OP (July / 16 results are strong), Japanop (July), and 4 of the World championships.
It's a very small number compared to the rest of the top players, but it's a much less heavy schedule.
In August, only one world championship won't be more tired than during the war.
The results will be good in the Middle War, which will be followed by a series of top conventions since September.
Taiwan's Ace, strong in battle.
Look at the young people in Thailand!
Hanyuki, who won the championships of Indonesia and Thailand (S500) also, has already entered the seven.
In September, he also entered the local capital OP and won the victory.
It's a game where the finish is strong and the battle is not in trouble.
It's not a big issue.
Rather, it will make it easier to adjust the schedules for future events by getting high points in the previous half of the war.
Until last year, Xiao Tsing had a weak impression of explosive power, but this year, with increased play stability, we are able to continue our performances.
To Momoda, the world's number one runner, it's going to be a lot worse than ever.
Except for these two players, the results were left in the last half of the war with Thailand's young Ace Cantaphon and the Indian circumcision B.
And the three men of Anders Antonsen who are fighting for the European front.
Cantaphones are not finals at the top of the competition, but they have the power to win the best 4 in the 2nd season.
There's still a rough side to it, but 20-year-olds (21-year-olds) who are able to compete with top players seem to have a lot of potential for leaps in the Olympics.
And the Cy Planes B. has taken a step back in India to match the single player.
The Indians after the Middle World need to be careful that Samir Balama, Prano H.S., and Sri Lanka's late wounded Sri Lanka will be followed.
The new cost of a cell phone, a fair competition, has been reduced:
"The new cost plan for the mobile company has been set up with the amended telecom law in the month of 0.
But now it's a huge dead end.
The price competition did not take place, despite the increasing expectations for lower prices.
It is a major factor that has led to a radical entrance into the Japanese economy and a continuing state of three major companies.
For consumers, it's a good idea to be a more affordable system.
I'd like to ask for the help of each cell phone company.
The amendment prohibits terminal costs and set fee discounts.
Because instead of selling the terminals at a low price, we had to set up a higher cost of communications.
The soft bank and KDDI(a) have announced a plan to make the terminal at a maximum of half the price.
But both companies have a "SIM lock" system on their terminal that can't use any other connection for the next 3,000 days.
NTT docomo only uses its subscribers to make terminal costs up to three-thirds.
All three companies seem to continue "instructions" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIMlock, the Ministry of Affairs has given us a policy that requires immediate dismission.
The company needs to respond quickly.
It's because the station and other networks didn't work out as planned.
I was expecting to be an explosive in the lower price race.
I'm guessing it's a bit of a diversion.
It's not even clear when or how much it will start.
As a social infrastructure company, I want you to work in a responsible way.
This change in fee was triggered by the statement of the Secretary of the Office of the Office of Directors.
He complained about the three new fees, "I think the competition is about to start.
I don't think "reduced" just distorts the market and encourages healthy competition.
Before the government talks about them, the companies should expand their competition for customer status.
So let's look at a couple of examples.
The consumer agency called attention to the fact that the terminal offers ads like "the maximum amount of money" and the consumer's burden is half greater.
Businesses themselves have to be polite and sensitive to make sure they don't make any misunderstandings.
Three credit cards in Miki Prefecture - Ise newspaper
On the 26th day, the three credit safes in Medhu province (the Three Trusts and northeastern bank) announced that they decided to lower the cash limit to prevent special fraud.
In the past three years, a depositor over 70 years of age who has not been able to negotiate more than a certain amount on an ATM account with a cash card will have an upper limit of 500,000 yen (U.S.).
The 3rd Trust Box and the Kahoku Trust Box will be dropped on October, and the Kahoku Trust Box will be dropped from November.
In the province, there are many special fraud cases that are charged with cash cards and passwords for financial services and police officials, and that credit security officials want to "preservate your bank account in as much a way as possible."
They're moving to the back of the land. Ii-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i
On 27 days, the Japanese Confederate Association announced that it had approved a transfer to a land-based room for three of the best men, Bedong, with the death of Ishita Ai.
It's the same room as Izumi.
My master's mother-in-law is from Ishii Room and his brother-in-law.
The parents of Ishii were in charge of the same one-door mirror room, and they were consulted about what they were going to do.
In the back room, there are ten misty horses from Mongolia, and at the fall, there are two warriors.

FL Quill, former British champion of "FL," can't be called "tuckle".
On the 26th day of the Japan World Cup, the United States, the last to appear in 20 countries, lost at 7-45 in England.
In the late hours of the Black Star, there was a wave of rough play played by FL John Quill.
One exit in the form of a sholder tackle on the face of the opponent.
The actual scene is also published by foreign media with videos, and former England champions are complaining that they can't be called "turtles."
"Indulgent and mean play" and "outland wave."
A single exit, a riot between both sides of the army... the actual moment of the face-to-face tackle played by the U.S. representative Quill.
A hot fight has crossed the line.
The last 29 minutes I've been here at 0-38.
Deep within the enemy's ranks, General Farrell of England has lost balance as he catches the pass of his opponent.
It was Quill that went to the tackle.
I just woke up on top of him, not on his back, and hit him hard on his upper body.
So let's do that.
Farrell was shot and thrown down.
In an apparently innocuous game, the English players are protesting wildly as they try to push Quill.
The two soldiers gathered together to form an explosive air.
As a result of the TMO, Quill was released with a red card.
He left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the spectators were also asking for a fair play.
The local media staff in rugby's powerful New Zealand featured the headline "Rugby W. 2019: US players leaving at a mean play and England winning."
"Kil's been in the British champion Farrell's face, and he's gone, "most of the battle between the two soldiers."
In this article, we will take a look at the comments of former English player and commentator Hugo Moña:
"It's insulting, it's vile, it's not what you can call a tackle, it's a mean play."
The United States, with one man missing, managed to avoid total defeat in its 81 minutes-on-the-minute trial.
But Quill's play has left a bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health and Welfare first published 424 of the 455 public hospitals across the country, such as the Red and the Red, as "no medical records are available".
In Fukui province, the Ministry of Health and Human Services tested the quality of treatment for the 4 public hospitals in Japan.
It's not right. It's wrong.
In order to curb the aging and expanding medical costs, we have gone through an unusual situation, in order to encourage re-integration and integration of hospitals in rival areas.
"I'm going to ask the hospital for a serious review of re-integration and integration, and I'm going to ask you to come to a conclusion by September next year.
There is no force, but fear of the loss of a nearby hospital will lead to the reaction of local chiefs and residents.
It was released at a meeting that same day.
The hospital was 29% for the entire population, and the hospital was relatively small.
In other parts of the province, there were higher rates of tidal flats (53.7 percent), North Sea Way (48.6 percent), Miyagi (47.5 percent), Yamaguchi (46.7 percent), and Okayama (43.3 percent).
The number of targets was 54 in the North Sea, the only one on the Okinawan coast was zero.
Based on the 20'7-year data, the Ministry of Health has studied 455 hospitals that are capable of dealing with "high emergency" for patients with serious illness.
He analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency care, and found out if the rival hospital was in a place within 20 minutes of the car.
I'm going to ask the hospital to consider abolishing it and moving some medical care to other hospitals.
The cost of health care is rising rapidly in 25 years, when the entire population is over 75 years old.
That's why the Ministry of Health has set the goal of reducing the number of beds in a hospital of 26,000 (8 years) across the country to "9000."
Now there are a lot of beds with the patient in a very tight position, with the cost of medical care, and the need for better rehabilitation for the elderly. — Iyad El-Baghdadi (@iyad_elbaghdadi) January 13, 2016
To cope with aging, not only do we need to reduce the number of beds, but we need to increase the amount of rehabilitation.
For the rest of the hospital's restructuring and integration, each municipality has designed a "clinical health plan" designed for the number of beds needed for 25 years.
The entire country is divided into 339 districts, where locals and health officials consult, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health wants to help the debates be activated by publishing the name of a poor hospital.
For the first time in eight years, it's been a great honor to have you read this article.
A program of emergency training intended for a 3-meter blast took place on September 27, in the forest, seven-and-a-half-year-old deer town of Tokushima.
About 400 employees and residents from 20 institutions, including roads and three towns.
It's the first time in the history of Japan since the Kokoku Motoki Fire Protection Council decided to evacuate the residents in August.
The wide range of training that residents participate in is "for the first time in eight years."
At 8:45 a.m., a blast of pygmy blasted the mud into the town below the mountain.
When the evacuation level was lifted to five, shelters were set up in the woods, in the towns of Seven Foods, and the residents were driven by buses and street patrols provided by each town.
A hundred thousand students are suing for school vacations for climate demonstrations in Vancouver.
An estimated 100,000 citizens, mostly students and 16-year-old environmentalist Greta Thunberg, marched on September 27, in the city of Vancouver in protest against climate change.
A climate demonstration in Vancouver.
The march took place from Vancouver city officials across Camby Bridge to the library downtown.
In front of the city hall at the assembly site, people with credit cards started gathering a few hours before the start, and at 13 p.m., they filled the streets of the city hall with a few blocks before the city hall.
After that, the participants continued to grow and eventually more than 100,000 people joined.
On the roads along the way, the police also worked together to keep an eye on everyone until they were all over the road for a few hours.
With the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, Vancouver has hosted many different events since last weekend to discuss warming.
On the last day, 27 days, a school strike called Friday for the future was launched.
The students who took off from school this day told adults that they wanted to protect the planet even after they were away from school, and many adults who took part in the work responded, "We're doing our best for the future of our children who are seriously learning."

On 27 days, the Ministry of Agriculture has issued a amendment to prevent the spread of the cattle plague, the cholera.
The area is selected for nine provinces, including the province of Manjima, where pigs and wild boars have been identified.
Inoculated live pigs, fertilized eggs, and so forth, are restricted within range, but we recognize the distribution of meat and processed products outside.
After a public comment to the general public, as soon as possible, it is towards completion of the process during the month.
By using vaccines and by allowing the distribution of meat and meat, they are no longer a "clean country" recognized by international agencies, and could affect the export of pork.
Since September, Japan has been in a state of temporary detention in a clean country.
In the amendment, in light of experts' opinion on areas that are at high risk for pigs from wild boars, the Ministry of Agriculture has set up a "responsible area".
In the next video, we will show you how to create a vaccine program that will allow you to use it in the governor's decision.
The other seven provinces that are listed as the recommended areas are Shizuoka, Fujiyama, Ishii, Nagano, Mitsuo, and Nuga.
When the guidelines are amended, the region will determine the situation and make a decision.
Inoculated pigs, sperms, eggs, bodies, and excretions are limited by principles.
The meat and the processed products are not subject to limited distribution costs or the impact of farmers, and they allow distribution out of virtual reach.
To prevent the virus from spreading, the food waste is thoroughly processed.
We're also working on preventing the destruction of the public's reputation.
The amendment to guidelines was brought together at a meeting of informed people on the same day and confirmed at the Center for Disease Control.
From now on, we will be conducting a discussion and public comment to the city of Tokyo on the 7th of December, providing a new epidemiologist.
The open approach to ManU, ManU!
I don't need the money.
9/28 (Land) 2:57 out.
As of last season, the Australian A League's Melvolon Victory has withdrew, and now the former former Japanese representative, MFO, has taken a surprising turn.
Did you actually go to the match?
The truth of the heavens will be revealed.
In the late 27th of Japan, Honda, who updated her Twitter at night, made an open approach to a club, saying, "Give me an offer.
The one who sent the reverse offer was the world-class Manchester United.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premium League?
It started with an Australian version of FOX Sports published on 24th.
In an article entitled “Five FWs Possible for Manchester United in the Face of Injury”, five currently uninhibited athletes were picked up.
Among such athletes as Hattem ben Alpha, Juzepe Rossi, Wilfred Boney, was the name of Honda.
Today, in United States, there are more and more injured people, including MF Paul Pogba, DFL Luke Shaw, DF Eric Berry, FW Antony Markals, FW Marcus Rashford.
The Red Devil, directed by Ole Gunner Sulu, has been forced by the league to win 2 22 and to slide hard, and has a problem with the front-line quality.
So it was Honda that the state media named him as the new war candidate for Teko.
In the article, we are told that the contract of Honda as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the holes buried by Andreas Pereira.
The 18 match score at Melbourne Victory is a solid record, but it is pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda has to get away from his entertainment and get full attention from the management of the Cambodian delegation."
Is Honda's approach working?
It's also important to note how United will move forward next year for the veterans who say the Tokyo Olympics are the goal.
The 500 mobile translation machines have been installed.
It's a mobile translation machine, "Poket," which gives free loans to 500 shops and other shops in the island city.
On the 26th day, the company announced that 500 units had been set up in shops on the island to give free access to a portable translator's "Poket".
It's the first time in the country that the translator is fully deployed in the same area, and it's the first time in the country to be able to improve its ability to respond.
It's a food store, 236, retailer, 3, hostels 7, and 34.
That's 60 percent of the city's district.
We've also started to display our loans to the Google Map, and we've started to find out where they are on our smartphones.
It's available to you from sites like the Beach Lake Tourism.
A free loan to Poketok for 74 languages began in April with a group of nine inbound support groups in the city.
The council bought 500 of them, loaned them to a small business firm that met conditions such as unsolicited authentication, cash responsibilities, and so on.
The manager of the trading council said, "I want you to start a new client with a foreign client in a tough business environment."
Do you now, the master of ShinHwa, need not even one shot at Sakimura?
Mr. Caddy, your best shot today.
The 1W shot doesn't necessarily have to be Tuped.
There's a trick called "Par 5's Second round," which is to hit the ball on the ground when you want to make a point.
In recent years, 1W may have a larger head volume and risk the scattering of the ball.
He's Yuichi, waiting for his first victory on the tour.
So let's look at a couple of examples.
So, we're going to talk about this in a second.
He said, "I'm going to have to do it straight."
You can drop a ball on Tierra's lawn from the training round, and then you can swing the one-w.
In the case where Big Carrie is needed, they use a lot of lifts, but they use direct drabs for small holes on both sides.
You can use it in a hole where your eyes are going down.
The ballistic instruments recorded 270-80 yd on Carrie.
So I don't need 3W, and Caddy's got to feel safer than 3W.
From the Japanese Tourism Prize in June, there's only one W in the caddy bag.
The second long club is a UT 17-degree lobby.
The way we're surprised by our fellow tours is to be glad to hear the moaning from the gallery.
The trick is to move the club to a level.
"I'm not going to go straight to the right if I hit it with a low blow, or with an upper one, I'm going to go straight to the right if I hit it with a cut, and I'm going to go straight to the right, and I'm going to go straight to the right to do the 1W shot swing correction, and the atak angle will be relaxed in this exercise.
The ball doesn't get caught, and there's a bit of a risk of a slice, so the left side can be turned off.
I'm going to tell Cantan that it's a very, very, very professional technique.
First ice on the Sea of the Sea - Yahoo! News
This season, the first ice to be seen in Tsubagakure Lake in Sakura, Japan, on the 27th.
On the 27th day of the month, ice was observed at the first time in the season.
Four days slower than last year's average of 0 years.
According to the Squid skyline management office, about 6:25 a.m. an employee patrolling the road confirmed that there was about two millimeters of ice on the western side of the lake.
The weather at the observation was sunny at three degrees Fahrenheit.
This day, according to the local weather station, the temperature in the province was 9 and 5 degrees in the city of Tsukugawa.
Let's go through the Paras.
Until tomorrow, a caravan event on the Ion beach.
In the year 2020, the Tokyo Paralympic event "The Challenge 6 in Fukushima" began on the ion mall beach on 28th, with the Tokyo Sea-Sunday Fire Insurance Service.
There are six games to experience in Paralympics: Bocha, Car Fencing, Car, Goalball, Landball, and Car Rugby.
Challenge 6 was held in Kappa, northeastern province, between July and October, and an Ion mall beach in Fukushima.
The Paralympic games are still less famous than the Olympic Games, but through challenge 6, they are designed to help many to understand by having a little experience like the Paraasrits.
In the hall, dressed in yellow costumes, he said, "Gots!

The children's play facilities and small children's playrooms, the construction of the Minami Plains, the Yamazhou Yamazhou newspaper, is determined by the construction.
Yamaguchi City is planning on building a private-funded PFI project, where the city council's permanent committee of city councils held on the 26th day set up by the children's play establishments and the new school buildings in the South Numazu area.
Image of the new children's amusement center in Yamazhou.
The children's amusement center plans to build on the north side of Kunihito's mountain district, and has an area of about 234 square meters (22,400 square meters).
It's a flat floor with about 3,000 square meters of floor space.
It's got a gym, a café, a library.
We also have 300 parking spaces outside with a uniform design instrument that can play with disabled children.
A review committee was held at the city hall on 5th of this month, and 13 shelter groups, including 15-year-old maintenance and management costs, dropped 350 million yen (U.S.).
In January next year, we'll start designing and building, and we'll start opening in March 2022.

A school of over 900 children in the South Numazu region.
We're planning to build north of the city's schoolhouse in Tonoyashi, and the area is about 21,500 square meters.
It's a three-story steel concrete structure with a length of about 880 square meters of floor space.
There are 30 classrooms, two pools, a steel gym, a child club after school.
In this six-day review committee, an eight-year-old municipality group, including the design and dismantling costs of the old school, dropped $4,121 million, including 15-year-old maintenance and management costs.
We're going to build it in December, and it's going to be completed in October of 2002.
This time, it's a success to make love.
It's decided that actress Kunihito will be present at the "Motkaria" (Start on 7th, Thursday and after midnight) in a Fuzzi TV drama.
Tokikiki plays the part, a colleague of a major food manufacturer working in Shibuya, Japan.
Not in the original composition, a thousand of the original drama characters are not interested in marriage, and marriage is a means to protect themselves from economic hardship.
That's where they showed up.
I see the future and the way we eat rice from the rare northern coast to Tokyo's headquarters, and I'm getting closer and closer to "the right marriage partner."
It seems to be strong, but it's weak, like tofu.
To set up a love strategy to prevent injury, you get very upset if things don't happen as they were supposed to.
A thousand ravens who live in vain meet the yucca and the mountains where they interact with each other.
This is the first time a Fuzzi-based ground-based drama has ever appeared in a series of stories about NHK series, and my sister's "Fuzzi TV novel" (196 :01), and "Black Pean" (TBS).
I'm looking forward to having fun with the Goto Mania, and I'm looking forward to creating this world of personality and charm.
It's also decided that after a thousand years of age, the new staff and clothing spin will be played by the Japanese.
The youngest of the regular casts will show you the fresh act of youth.

Minister of Health, to see his family with leprosy. Three department meetings to eliminate discrimination.
In a 27-day press conference after the cabinet, the Minister of Health and Health, Japan's Minister for Health and Human Services, made it clear that he would meet with members of the family of a former leprosy patient on the second of December.
They also announced that they would hold a meeting with the Ministry of Health and Education and the Ministry of Justice on the same day to resolve discrimination and prejudice against former patients and their families.
He said, "I want to listen to your family and work hard to solve the problem."
The family of the former patient is ordered by the Bear Manufacturing Court to pay about 376 million yen (U.S.) to a plaintiff 54 in June.
Prime Minister Yasuke Yasuke has issued an appeal and the verdict has been established.
They also thought that as a government, they would work on compensation measures and human rights awareness.

A copy of his original manuscript before the suicide of Tsubagakure was first published in the weak and sad literary newspaper Att estuary
His original manuscript, originally published at the Tatsuke-sama Museum in Tokugawa, Japan.
The author, Xiao Xiao Xiao, received his personal copy of the first night's essay, which was published in the first year of his literary battle with Sakusaki, Japan, on the 27th of the day of Toshio-mura, in the northern part of Tokyo.
It will be displayed at the House since the day of ' 0'.
It was known that there were essays, such as the whole collection, but it was the first time that the originals were published publicly.
A few months before it was believed to be a suicide attempt, Inoue Ishii, a memorial researcher, says that the river will be so vulnerable and vulnerable that it will be able to face the challenges and challenges of literature.
Two essays, the 200 - volume manuscript, were published in the April 27 issue of "The Spring of the Geology."
"Why do the big people mock and threaten children?"
Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech has been noted, there has been an insulting announcement made to Mrs. Greta:
"Why do the big people mock and threaten their children?"
A political critic said on an American television show about Gretchen that she was “mentally ill, used by her parents and by international left wing” and apologized to a television station.
In Japan, there's a lot of people saying that you should go to school, that you should go to school.
In the meantime, on September 26th, Greta posted on her Twitter: “Why do the big people use their time to mock and threaten teenagers and children?”
"I think of all the lies and conspiracy that I can think of."
She started to post, "Look, you know, those who hate me are still active, my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and I'm going after different people, and they're thinking about all the lies and conspiracy that they can think of."
He pointed out that the big people seem to be on the verge of a conversation because they do not want to face the climate or the environmental crisis.
To be honest, I don't understand why big people use their time to mock and threaten teenagers and children.
You could do another good thing at that time.
I think they feel threatened to us.

The 432nd TV broadcast council of Tada was held to discuss the really delicious curry of Akita, which was presented by editors, professional cooks, and celebrities from August 6th.
The show introduced different curry shops, professional taste points in the home, and some of the elaborate Retreto Calais stories.
While the committees said that "the concept and the subject were plain and simple to the end" and "carry bread" and“I could see from different perspectives of the gurmé site," they also said that "a long recaptation drama wanted advice on how to make professional curry."

- Eagle Six, did you see the winner in Bardy 7?
And then you have a chip in the middle, and then you have one in the middle, and then after you hit Boggy on number four, you still have one left, so you're ready to return.
And then finally, we got to the point where we didn't have to go to the point where we didn't have to go to the point where we didn't have to go to the point where we didn't have to go to the point where we didn't have to go to the point where we didn't have to go to the point where we didn't have
- Did you get anything at the competition?
So let's do another one.
So let's do a couple more examples.
- What's the difference?
So I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
I didn't care about myself.
I don't know how many other events have changed since then, but since there are fewer Japanese players in the team,
We're going to go through the second half of the fight, but if we don't win more than one, we're going to win another.
What is the best way to prevent the onset of dementia from happening?
I'll tell you about it.
A drug of dementia that has been challenged by major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals to develop research.
But we're beginning to understand the relationship between dementia and lifestyles, and we're beginning to see that it's extremely mild, it's possible that we can just forget about things.
I spoke to Professor Nakajima's stroke center.
There's no way he's going to have Alzheimer's.
- What's going on?
So, if you're older, if you're older, you're more likely to suffer from Alzheimer's.
But it's still thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop a new drug for dementia.
So, this is a drug that's often used in Japan, and it's already out of the way in some countries.
In the meantime, people are able to live longer as the death from infections and accidents has been reduced and cancer deaths have been reduced by dramatic advances in treatment of antismoking drugs.
And that's why there's a growing number of dementia patients.
It's not just about yourself and your family, it's about creating a secure environment in the community as a whole.
It's a way to keep things in perspective.
- Are there people who are more prone to dementia?
And even if it's inevitable that you have major dementia, there's a chance that you can lower your symptoms as much as possible and leave them as you like, as much as you can.
It's not just that people tend to be more prone to this.
So let's look at some examples.
It's not just the symptoms of the disease, it's the symptoms of the disease.
It's a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol.
And that's what we're going to do.
In the United States, for example, there are areas where food tickets are distributed to the poor.
We can't use gas, we can't use electricity, we can't cook.
It's not that simple, but it's very simple.
We're going to have to be poor and obese, we're going to have to watch TV, we're going to be disabled.
And that's what we're going to see in the next video.
And that's what we're going to do in this video.
So, to prevent dementia, we need to read from day to day and think about things.
In Osaka, there's Mershe in charge of the tour and special product PR, and there's a full cave VR.
"Practaining tourist destinations and special goods in the reserve area" began on 27 days, about two days in the square of JR.

Jagger F-PACE, first major improvements...and potential hybridization.
In southern Europe, cameras first caught a prototype of the first cross-over SUV, F-PACE (FPaCE).
F-PACE is the source of the first four-line concept SUV, C-X17, which was published in 2013.
Then, in 2014, a five-line edition was published, officially decapitated as "F-PACE" at the Frankfurt Motors Show in 2015.
The following year, the first current model to be launched in 2016 will be the first facelift.
The prototypes are covered with thick camouflage, but some of the new designs are visible.
It seems that the headlights are more compact, and are more designed, and so are the side air-intenses.
The grill is completely faked, but I'm sure it'll be re-engineered.
At the rear end, you can see some of the new taillights with a long, thin reverse light on the top.
And so, we can see that this is a very, very simple way of doing this.

The program features specialists from various fields, answering the questions of small mountains and guests.
The theme is "vitamin."
We're going to welcome our guests, Toyoshi Toyoshi, Diana Extravaganza, and learn about vitamins and their work.
We also have plans for a day-long meal to be published to make sure that the mountains are in good health.

The actors Hideshima (48), Nishida Akita, and Nakataka, 77 on the 27th day, opened the first stage of the movie at the Tokyo-TO-Simonomas Shinjuku.
It's a fairy tale with a personal and dense cast.
Nishida has not only performed, but also presented her version of "The Day of the Day" in a tag with the Tokyo Scalables Orchestra.
And the most frustrating part of the movie was that Nishida was singing and that she was jealous of memera.
Nishida was proud of it three times in the past, if you'd rather be a singer than an actor.
And he promised to sing a live song, "When the film continues to be filled."

In the neighborhood, some of the youths took over the highway and threw a burning bottle at the government building.
With protests that started with the amendment to the case of the fugitives, the participants renewed their determination to fight until the "real general election" that was not won at the time.
In June, the protest, which was fully formalized, became a "two days" of more than 79 days of the umbrella movement, and the demonstrators' demands were extended to "five grand demands" for reform of the election system.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
