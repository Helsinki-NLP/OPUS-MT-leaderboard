There are also new products that can only be eaten at this time of the year and a campaign to get out of it!
I don't like watching TV anymore because of that.
I don't know if I've been able to do it.
I saw a thousand birds at Netflix yesterday, but when I said something I didn't like, there were a lot of scenes where the staff were grinning behind me.
I don't think it's creepy to laugh at everything you say because you're a selling entertainer.
But if you don't smile, the geisha's mood is bad, and you're not going to get along well with the job.
It's like an old black company, it's like some geisha's egos are just too ugly and you can't eat them unless you do.
On the other hand, there's a lot of "don't lick a geisha" argument that the geisha himself has a lot of hard work to do.
I know you have very little income until you sell it, but even if you're told that you're at the top of your job, you're at the top of the line.

I took the liberty of replacing the product I ordered at the Tukmonanet shop.
So let's take a look at a few examples.
It's not a commercial problem, it's not a commercial problem, it's a business issue.
It started last Friday when I found an MSI radio-goning mouse selling for $3,280 at the Tukunnet shop's Sunday sale.
And so, in this case, we're going to go to the store and we're going to go to the store and we're going to go to the store and we're going to go to the store and we're going to go to the store and we're going to go to the store and we're going to go to the store and we're going to go to the store and we're going to go to the door and we're going to go to the store and we're going to go to the store and we're going to go to the store and we're going to see if it's going to be the same price, and we're going to see if it's going to be the same, and we're going to see if it's going to be the same.
They sent me an email, and I sent it the next day.
In these two e-mails, and in the history of buying my page, the name "CLUTCHG41 LIGWUTT WIRELES" was written.
At this point, I thought the wireless mouse would arrive because there was no contact or cancel notice from order to ship.
I got an e-mail a few hours after the shipment, saying, "There was a mistake registering a product."
According to the e-mail,
* I was selling radio plates for sale, but they were in fact cabled.
* We've already shipped the wire mouse
1. Deny and Cancel
Return only mouse and return
3. Use line mouse as you want.
You'll have to choose your response.
It's a very simple version, but it's a very simple one, because there's a separate line and a wireless page, and it's written in the purchase history, in the mail, in the store, in the store, and it's wireless, but it's replaced by a wire version.
If you've been sent to the store without a confirmation of anything different than what you bought, then if you want to return it, why don't you send it back?
I want you to give me the wisdom to finally take the money back and fight back.
Do you think you don't want to go out with people who aren't close to your family, even if you’re looking for a partner or a partner?
Or does it matter?
If you care, why is that?

I don't care.
We're not close to each other.

Is PlayStation 5 the only place you can play a real-time professional baseball 2022?
So let's take a look at a couple of examples.
It's going to be a lot easier to do.
Once again, the only bridge leading to the area in typhoons and heavy rains is dislodged.
Matsumoto-san from Yagahara, Fukushima.
It was the September Japanese typhoon that had a profound impact on the lives of the three of us.
You're like, "Are you serious at first?"
The only road leading to the highlands was the Hijihara Bridge, and 30 families were isolated by the Japanese typhoon.
The locals who were forced to cut water continued to carry their supplies through the JR bridge, which is not normally accessible.
Matsumotoro: “The car usually comes down to the garden with a car on its back, or with its back on its back, and you sensed traffic and the benefits of the car.” "The first bridge, completed within three months, was once again isolated for a few days after the heavy rain and a temporary bridge had taken over.
After more than two years of recovery, Matsumoto-san continues to take a hard look at the lesson:
"I think there's about zero cases."
For the time being, I wanted to get enough food for two or three days, so I had about three times as much food as I had before.
"I don't know when anything else will happen to me, but I've realized that I need some supplies and all of you." On the other hand, I've experienced an "unforeseen disaster"
Since 202 to remember the lesson, we've started our own initiative in town.
Yasaka Town, Education Department and Takahashiru: "It is decided in the form of the "Dark Day of Yasaka City" and an announcement is made that the " 0th 2" will be the day that will be considered prepared for disaster.
"I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do that.

Experience with a paramarine (TOKYO MX) - Yaoo! News
On December 12, 2021, Tokyo hosted an event in which it was possible to run a digital marathon of Paralympic.
This event was held to allow us to experience the new pleasures of sports and the attractions of Tokyo’s tourism through digital means.
So, the first thing we did was we had a running machine and a road bike, and visitors were running for a marathon course of paralympics that had been reproduced in the virtual space with their own equipment.
Each tablet shows a virtual space, with its own Avatar, which allows you to compete for a marathon course with participants from around the world, and you can enjoy the city's tourist attractions.
Participants, they've had a great change of scenery.

When buying used houses, be careful!
What are the pitfalls of the Building Status Research System?
● A new building-research system designed to activate used housing markets.
House building, apartment building, prices are going up, and reform markets are going up.
It will also affect the fact that the popularity of the word "multiple" and "multiple" in the word "mass-to-might" have greatly reduced the relatively inexpensive new property.
However, there is still a low level of existing housing sharing in Japan compared to overseas.
So, in 2018, the Ministry of Transportation changed some of the property building trade laws, began a building survey designed to trade in secure used housing, and started what is called "instruction" (https: / /www.mit.jp.com/00121990.pdf).
This is a system that the master architect in the house will be able to check the status of the property, including the degradation of the property, and then present to the buyer in the report.
The Ministry explains the advantages of both buyers and sellers through the introduction of interagency.
The sellers are able to avoid the crem after they are handed over by conducting property research before the transaction, and give the buyer a sense of security.
It's also a way to discriminate against competitions.
On the other hand, the buyers also say that it is a system that can determine the state of the houses they plan to buy and that it can be purchased with great benefit.
But in the current system, it is the sellers who are the main ones who lead the investigation of the building.
In addition, I would like to note that only the announcement of the system of Instance has been mandatory.
In other words, you can introduce a real estate broker to an architect who says, "I can't" or "I can't look into the building," but the operation itself is not compulsory.
● The risk of concern at the market-led Instruments, while looking overseas, is already being maintained in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, where the old markets are thriving.
In the preceding phase of the housing trade, the purchasers ask experts called Inspectors and Billing Saveyers to investigate the building.
In the United States, for example, in the state of the state, an Integration is being made at 70 to 90 percent of the used housing transactions.
It's just that the buyer leads the sales, and the main type of Japanese exchange and its nature are very different.
The sellers are trying to sell the building as high as possible and as high as they can.
The buyer wants to live in peace with the investigation and with proper repair.
Even with the same input, both goals and thoughts have gone wrong.
So the following concerns about the Japanese system have been pointed out:
● The country's market-based Inspection area remains minimal.
It's not a detailed investigation, so there's a real risk that you're going to miss something.
So it's not like they're not going to report their findings against their sellers.

Ginza was an island?
Five miscreants to talk in silver bra (LEON. JP) - Yahoo! News
This was an old peninsula.
In fact, if you're not able to do a little bit of school, you're not going to be able to do that.
So let me show you a little bit of what I'm going to do in this video.
Up top of Ginza!
First entry into King's Landing.
As you walk through Ginza, you will find the strange name of the place, the mysterious stela, and a number of the places where the land of the Ginza has been carved.
I was walking with her on the Ginza, and I didn't expect to see her again.
Ginza used to be a peninsula?
It's an alias for downtown where the Japanese people have produced "symbol", the "symbol" in central Tokyo.
In the first place, Ginza is the foundry of silver.
At the time, he called it the Shinjuku, but when he moved to Zhangu, he became known as Ginza.
By the way, the area around Ginza used to be a peninsula that ran into the sea.
Until before the Edo period, the Edo from Manjidani to Tentai had entered, and from the Japanese bridge to the Ginza, the island of Edo was extended by the island of Edo.
The tip of the peninsula is the present silver throne.
When Tetsukawa opened his tent in Edo, he buried the cove and proceeded to establish the Kyobashi District.
In addition, he built a city block and built a moat for the development of ships.
Then he cut down the ground and the mountains of Koda and buried them in the cove.
There's still a stela of "The Land of the Ginza" that shows the remains of the Ginza in front of Tifani Symposium 2-7.
I've never heard of a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
The Ginza has a yearly pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
Of the more than ten holy places, the most visible is the Song of God in front of the Miyagi.
A company at the far right of the Ch’in Cyrene has not many visitors before or after the show.
On the other hand, the Dragon Light Instrument is on the roof of a gyrus, and the Master of the Silver Circumnavigation is on the 9th floor of the Silver Circumcision.
"Georgia" and "Georgi" are located behind the alleys, but "Gehenna" is also known for their reverence for the city gate of Kunihito, a city of the best known singer, and "Fentra", which is located in the Ginza, only when it comes to eight shrines.
In this shrine, there are also a number of shrines with kings of inquisition and castles.
In front of the company, the fox greets them, and where there are many farmers, they are built with the benefit of a good harvest.
It turned out to be the profit of commerce in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and in Japan's most downtown and Ginza, faith spread.

A man's body was found in Shizuoka River in Nagoya-Sayama.
12 days before noon, a man was found lying down on his knees in the Kunihito River in the famous Kunihito area.
The police are investigating male identity, cause of death and so on.
According to the police, at 11:30 a.m. 12 a.m., a passerby found a man lying down on his knees in Shizuoka River in Shizuoka.
The man was rescued from the river, but he was confirmed.
We're looking for cause of death as well as the police hurrying to identify him.
On the other hand, death has been confirmed by the death of some 70-year-old men who were found lying in the river in the Sand River in the city of Nakazaki.
It's not a bad thing.
The police are hurrying to identify him, and they're checking the situation back then.

South Korea's Posco International bribed Senex Energy, a multi-state gas-da business expanded to South Korea (WW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Posco International announced on 12 days that they had signed an investment contract to take over the stock exchange of Senex Energy, and to take in Hancock Energe and Senex Energy.
Now there is still a process, such as a pass by the Senese Ennazi corporation and the approval of local law, which will be completed in March next year.
The purchase will be one of the largest global acquisitions and constituencys since Posco International was integrated into the Posco group in 2010.
In the last video, I showed you a couple of examples.
Posco International explained that even during the energy shift, the demand for natural gas continued to grow, and when natural gas-based blue hydrogen splits the market with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market, Posco International decided to buy it.
Posco International will be able to obtain an 802 billion cubic feet of natural gas (802Bcf) worth of natural gas in South Korea, 24 percent of the gas consumed in 2019, as well as land-gas operators on the island.

Is that knee pain, or could it be "flexible knee syndrome"?
A different treatment (Medical DOC) - Yaoo! News
It's been a long time since I've had knee pain.
What might be the disease?
The pain in the knee is caused by various injuries, arthritis, and a painful seizure.
And we'll talk a little bit about this in the next video.
What do you mean, your joints are deformed?
That's right.
The surface of the joint is essentially covered with soft bones and is responsible for reducing the impact and smoothing the joint.
So, if you're in the middle of the night, you're in the middle of the night, and you're in the middle of the night, and you're in the middle of the night.
It's a very difficult process, but it's also a very difficult process.
Editor: Does a neuroarthritis occur besides the knee?
Yes, sir.
It's not just the knee, but it can also be the toe joint or the toe of the hand, the neck, the waist, the toe, the hip.
So, there are several ways to do this.
Editor: What is the structure of joints in the first place?
[Ben] So this is what we're going to do. >>Teacher:
So, this is what we're looking at here.
So let's see.
So let's see if we can do that.
And this is what we're going to see in the next video.
This joint fluid serves as a lubricant and consists of hyalronic acid and condochin sulfuric acid.
This is why we're going to say, "To smooth your knees, you want hyalronic acid or condochin sulfate."
Editor: What are some of the symptoms of deformity?
Dr. Woyama: The joint joint is sticky and elastic, and it plays a role in preventing bone from hitting directly.
So let's say I have a cushion here.
But if it's worn or distorted, it can deform the joints, cause inflammation, and cause pain.
Is it pajamas when you go to bed?
It's a basic pajamas, but when the pajamas are in the laundry or something, they come in and they sleep!
Are there people who can quit smoking, heavy smokers, or people who can't quit?
So let's say I have two groups of two.
I knew him, but I quit.
I don't know if I'm going to do it, but I'm going to do it.

Gambling and Game 3 (real sounds) - Yahoo! News
The gambling cartoon series "Caizi" is the most popular and explosive series in the center of men.
One of the best games in the book is a game of extreme limits that you've put your life on.
Just looking at it makes my legs numb... trying to cross the steel.
So, I'd like to go back and see if we can actually play this game, or see if we can actually play it, or see if it's played in the project video.
▪ Numa, a papill full of traps in the book "The Lottery."
In its original work, it was a high rate of 4,000 yen.
This swamp had a large trap of nailwood, motorist, and a three-level kran, which was considered almost impossible to destroy.
But they used every kind of hand, and finally they came out on a hard journey, which was to sink a water tank made of plastic into the building, and to a great extent to their surprise.
The swamp in Kaizi actually appeared as pachin, and a lot of people play.
Of course, it's not a "$4,000", it's a little less difficult, but you can feel it.
▪ In the "starside party" held by the rich and the rich, it was the ironwork of the human race that caused the debtors to perform it.
The borrowers work hard not to fall over the thin steel bones set up on 10 meters above the ground and compete for their speed.
There are 12 participants, 2 top players, only 4 irons, not enough safety measures, and a significant risk of death.
This is a very dangerous story, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, we can experience it very close to the Eagle Bridge, located at the home of the Proball and the Golden Eagle of Northeastern Japan.
This Eagle Bridge is 20 meters high, with a steel bridge leading to Skyblanco and a victory bridge.
Of course, safety measures are under way.
On his YouTube, the Koorra storm, a joker, became a topic of conversation when he published a video of walking through the Eagle Bridge, saying that it is possible to experience steel in Japan.
▪ Two card games, E card.
One of the emperor's cards, eight citizen's cards, ten slave cards, and ten different players.
This game is very well played, the emperor is strong for the people, the people are strong for the slaves, and the slaves are strong for the emperor.
In a play, Kaiji fights against the Tohashi River with a hard rule: "If you lose, you can cut your ear."
In the final battle, when a device like earphones, like earphones, was able to detect pulses, temperature changes, and so forth, was able to read the mind, he confused his ears to the limit and won.
The E card is marketable and can be purchased at Amazon.
On YouTube, the popular YouTuber has posted a video playing with Fujihara Tohara and E-card who played in a movie.
▪ Do you have any idea what it's like to be a kid?
People don't want to be in a condition like Kaiji, but the fact is, when you read cartoons, they make you feel as good as they feel.
Let's take a look at the world through the game.
One step to the New Year, gently push it
The next year, the Great Horse of the Land of the Protection of the New Year, came to the site of the Protection of the State of the State.
An 11-day festival was held in front of the shrine.
The shrine has been commissioned by a geisha to paint the original horse since last year.
This time, the work was adopted by Professor Natsumi Mitsumi (22) for three years.
So let's see.
The landlady said that she drew a picture of a cherry pushing her back to the new year with a gentle push.
The sight of the tiger, standing still and staring at the cherry blossoms, filled me with the hope that I could afford to enjoy the beauty of nature in a world that is changing so much.
The architect's designs are also on widely distributed painting horses.
Chiba, Miki-kun, said, "I think I can help all people overcome their difficulties."

Let's think about "I want to stay here."
What kind of town is it in 2030?
The students from 4 high school in Tamano are working together to think about the "I want to continue living" workshop.
In part of the research and policy proposals for the Inter-SDSD organization, I urge the mayors to gather the voices of the young.
"When are you having fun?"
I'm going to ask you a question, and you're going to say, "When you're playing a drum, you're going to say, "When you're playing a drum, you're going to answer it."
It was the first time that the three of them were held at the sunrise meeting.
The World Café, a method used by the eight high school students and locals to talk to each other about the island, where each theme was decided on, was a fun city, a town, a town with a sense of meaning for life.
I'm going to write them all down, put them on a fake paper, and organize them.
It's interesting to see towns where there's a lot of young people who don't need trains, buses, and so on.
I don't know if there's anything in common, we'll talk more.
I thought Tamano was boring, but it's fascinating to ride the beach, and it's a three-year-old student in Tamano.
Three years ago, a student in Kunihito, Japan, said, "We have fewer shops, we have less traffic, we have more natural areas," and adults spoke and noticed not only local challenges but also attractive things.
"The second time in February, only high school students will be able to organize the proposal.
We're going to invite mayors and educators to announce next February.
The director of the center, east of the center, says, "Environment of high school native love is the key factor in the development of youth."
At 4 M5.0 in Kanto, the source of the quake is in the southern part of Tsubagakure.
At about 12:31 p.m. on 12 p.m., there was a 4-degree earthquake in every province of Kasai, Shizuki, Mao, and Shizuoka.
According to the Weather Agency, the earthquake is at the center of the southern region of Tsubagakure, which is about 50 kilometers deep.
The magnitude of the quake is estimated to be 5.0 on the Richter scale.

Is there a time when there will be cloth on my neck?
So, I'm going to do a little bit of this.
I thought if I had a stove with no cloth, and no curling around, I would have found something new.
The brand "CATORI" is about the length of a meter and is more compact than the general size.
When I first saw it, "Can you wrap it so short?"
And you can see that it's made into a piece of cloth, and it's made into a long piece of cloth.
So here's what we're going to see.

So let's see.
Stylist Ishida.
I'm going to go to Disney+, and I'm going to go back to that.
This is Peter Jackson's director, getting Buck.
It's so fresh, like a big-sized drummer, it's so fresh...
It's a little bit more dramatic, but it's a little bit more dramatic, because it's just about dismantling.
"I know I'm in trouble, but I know I'm in trouble," or "I'm in trouble," or "I'm in a hurry," or "I'm in a hurry," or "I'm going to be late," or "I'm not going to be late, or "I'm going to be late," or "I'm going to be late."
I mean, I don't know if we've ever hated each other enough to fight like that, but there's a huge feeling in the air that we can't work together anymore.
It's like, "Oh my God, I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you."
And while we're both talking about "How's it going?" from a little phrase, it's really hard for us to get into that "what's going on?"
And I'm going to show you a few examples.
It's amazing when you're in the middle of a song that's slowly and slowly like a hung-huong-hoong and it's kind of like a wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah---ah--ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah--------ah------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's just that we're all wearing a lot of fat, so just watching the performance makes us happy.
So far, I've had the impression that the biggest disband was the environment.
When they started to make music with a bit of a grin in it, it made them happy, but when they said, "What are we going to do with the place of the live?" and the producers and the commercials were like, "Oh, we're the best in the world!" and I could see that they were out of their hands.
Well, the documentary also interprets the director, so maybe that's how Peter Jackson felt.
I thought that's why he's so bad about a lot of things.

So let's say that I'm going to live a little bit.
I'm sick of my job, and I'm sick of dying, and I'm not very good at business, but I think I'm really good at what customers want me to do.
I've been told that I couldn't do something that I'm a little good at, but if I can find something that I'm a little good at, and I can do, it'll make my life a little easier for me.
So let's think about it a little bit.
I think there is a daily life, so if you have a company union or an industrial doctor or an open door, you might want to consult it once you have some sort of system.
I hope you'll be able to live with a little bit of comfort from now on.

Great damage in the United States, because of the off-time warming and the strong cold.
Ten days of local time (gold), 11 days of night, and a lot of tornadoes around the southern part of the United States.
It's been observed that in the early 1990s, there was a very strong cold, which at this time was a record warm, which caused the atmosphere to become very unstable, and the custodial cloud seems to develop rapidly.
It's a hot, hot air coming from the Southwest, and it's been recorded at high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature for nine days of local time and ten days has risen to 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
In the mid-19th century, the climate was very hot, and in the mid-1930s, near the top of the sky, the cold temperatures below 100 degrees Fahrenheit, caused a very active front line to form and rapidly develop in the form of cloud formations along the front lines.
It's possible that there's a series of tornadoes in the neighborhood.
The southern part of the United States is a region where tornadoes are more likely to occur, but it's a high season from first summer to summer, and many cases where heavy damage occurs at this time of year.
The storm alerts that were announced in the winter nearly 150 times were recorded.
The U.S. Air Force has reported more than 400 tornadoes and storms in just 10 days of local time.
So this is the area that we're looking at here, and we're looking at the area of the line.
In Kentucky, we reach the third level of EF3 from the stronger of the six, and in the moment, we see a storm of wind around 70m/s.
In the future, some of the tests may be determined as EF4.5.
In Japan, JEFs are used to fit the situation of Japanese architecture, and so on.
This is an example of what happens in Japan.

The biggest in the history of the U.S. tornadoes are also calling for live air support from behind the rubble.
On the subject of tornadoes in the mid-west and southern part of the United States, the president of the United States, Biden America, said he saw the 11th and the "one of the biggest tornadoes in U.S. history."
American CNN TVs, etc.
Mr. Biden stressed that he would do everything in his power as a federal government.
He explained that he still doesn't know how many lives were lost.
There's been more than 100 deaths.
In Kentucky, where the tornado was damaged, residents carrying household items from broken homes to broken homes were forced to carry more than 30 tornadoes in at least six states, between 10 and 11 days before dawn.
The area affected by tornadoes remains a record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) that affected Missouri and elsewhere in 1925.
Mayfield, Kentucky, was hit hard by a 24-hour-old candle factory in preparation for a Christmas trade battle.
At the time, 110 people worked there, but the building was destroyed and the remains disappeared.
In the darkness, a woman who was trapped under a three-and-a-half-foot thick rubble felt the weight of a rescuer searching over the rubble.
In addition to the cries of women calling for help, the song of the song "Happy Birthday to You" was sung, apparently by screaming and other women crying to drown fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store in Mayfield, was safe, hiding in his basement with her five-year-old son.
"A lot of people are like the sound of trains, but it was like the sound of the earth coming out of something more."
The Mayfield police officers will continue to search until they're no longer required.
I don't know if it's weeks, months, or years, but I've been working hard to help.
In Illinois, some of the warehouses in the Internet-commercial Amazon have been destroyed, and at least six people have been confirmed dead.
There's been a series of roadblocks due to the impact of derailment of trains and the fall of highways.

It's an old saying that there's a difference in the way we think about the system of assessment.
While foreigners are reducing it by five stars, Japan is claiming that three stars are neutral.
So here's what we're going to do in this video.
If we're based on five stars, then we're in the same line with all the others, and if we're inclined to do that, we're in the wrong place on a system that doesn't give us the meaning of the stars, but we don't want you to name three of them because that's what we're doing right now.
So when you try to argue with people who claim this kind of argument, you don't get to talk about it.
The words you want to be told, or the words you like to say.
So let's see if we can do that.

"Freaked fish and shrimp, caught in the waters of the Sea, homemade tartar sauce."
The colorful lunches and dills that have been used with a lot of vegetables have been "hakubune".
"May my family feel like a restaurant."
One of the popular lunches is "Flys and shrimps from the time they were caught in the waters of the Sea."
Fish choose their occasional goods on the market.
"Fly is thin as much dough as possible so that you can understand the texture of the material."
For lunches, there are four kinds of vegetables, four kinds of dili, and a half-sized rice and soup.
Vegetables are made by themselves in the fields nearby, and sold in the departments.
The side dish changes at different times, but you're doing French work, and there's a lot of rappes and lattoyuu.
On the other hand, it's like a roll of eggs, and it's made of a taste that's easy to eat, and it's a wide range of generations to enjoy.
The lunches are also popular with the national meats.

Speed, of course it's too late.
It's safe, it's slow, it's perfectly shut down, it's safe, it's dangerous, it's dangerous.
It's like, "Oh, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know."
Not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It's a shame to have a little less people or a little more attention.
I thought I'd just make a special lane and try not to get in the way of the rest of the walk.
It's just, you know, it's kind of slow, it's slow, it's easy to look at the view, and I thought it would be nice if you didn't have a few more people.
It was the excitement of the near future, of how these automatic drivings will become mainstream in the future, and the challenge of not having a comfortable, rather patient mind with the pain of the eyes around us.
Damn it, I'm embarrassed.
It's a veredha delivery.

A long journey of family roots in rural China (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
China, with its vast territory, is also important for biodiversity.
Some municipalities recognize the value of biodiversity, not just the environment of the locals, but the activities of environmental activists.
One such region is Seasapana, in southern China.
My sister, Shisapana, is now an actress, is a border between Laos and Myanmar, is a Thai tribe, shares roots with Thai people in the kingdom of Thailand, and is a minority community.
The Mekong River is flowing through Southeast Asia.
The Shisapana Thai state, which is only about 0.2 percent of the country's population, is home to about 25 percent of the wild animals and 20% of the plant species.
This time, I met Shisapana, an environmental worker, on the ground and talked to her about the content of her activities.
▪ Starting environmental activity with my German husband — I've been doing environmental work for 20 years.
What was the trigger?
We've been working on it since 2000.
This is my husband, Joseph Margraf.
My husband is from Germany, and he came to Syzapana for a joint science project in the United Nations and China.
This is the only rain forest region in China.
It's not a good thing. It's a good thing.
In the last few years, more than half of the world's rain forests have been cut down, so that the area will be established, and that's why before, large-scale deforestation of the rain forest has been introduced to produce rubber that was scarce in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to study natural resources and biological resources.
I'm a journalist, and I'm married.
- Were you interested in conservation?
I'm from Shisapana, but I didn't care about the importance of the rain forest or the meaning of biodiversity.
And so I started working on this project.
And I'm going to show you a little bit of an aura here.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
The aura is not what you're trying to get out.
And I think that's what I'm going to do in this video.
I'm sure he has a strong inner confidence.
High-functional and high-quality rover boots are handmaiden to the workers.

I can see it.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I don't know what that means.
Did you give him a compliment?
What if I confess to Tatsuya-san?
I'm sure you'll agree with me by saying,
So let's do another example.
If you choose not to open your NISA account now if you want to open an Essay Account, can you open it later at the time you want to open it?
So let's do one more.
So let's do that.
It's not that it's expensive, it's not that it's expensive, so I'd recommend that you start the NISA account at once so you can use it as soon as you want.

The precise timing of the CTD
* All of this is done by papills, .Net Scrolls, log-type.
* Some NPC killings/aggregation time: Essenials be Gon in console.
* When you're working with some of NPC's active cameras, the PC's killave configuration OFF is improved by OFF via.ini.
* Moving (for example, ice-cold) fields + partial magic (e. g. NPC) in motion, NPC: Diet & Black v 2.0 SPAID application setting (top right MC) all improved with five consecutive tests on OF.
Is it because of some partial feature/NPC additives or body mesh shade error?
So here's what we're going to do.
And I think that's what we're seeing here.
I was asked to post a post about a similar CTD problem in a Japanese environment that might be useful as a memory.
They're all doing it in mental capacity.
No one around is aware of it, no one's working with you or your family.
Sometimes I look around, and I'm optimistic that he's doing a very good job.
But maybe he's also a little mental.
I'm not mentally retired, but I'm sure it was too late just before I retired.
I'm going to talk to you today about the importance of mental health care.
I have been cared for for for a long time because of bipolar disorder, but I think I’ve been working with nurses at the visiting station that I’m currently using and have a very good relationship.
We're going to talk a lot about it every week.
Of course, they also do what they need to do to control their medication, but above all, they've seen how important it is to have fun communication for those with mental illness.
We've talked about gender differences and gender issues and we've talked about gender.
We're talking about male and female sexual desires, how she got divorced, how to be a visiting nurse?
Sometimes I'm dressed as a woman.
I've been told that if you're a nurse who can't work in the ward, or if you're a therapist who's here, and you're in the hospital, you're going to tell them, "I'm taking care of you," or something like that.
I think I am using a little visiting station run by social workers, but I think it's a really good nurse who is able to face Frank with me with a mental illness.
She's beautiful, by the way.
I'm sure some of you are taking care of mental health care, and some of you are thinking about taking care of mental health care.
And that's what we're going to talk about today.
If the doctor agrees, I'll take it.
So let's do that.
So let's see.
I'm sorry.
I know it's a false alarm, but I'm scared I'm coming out of English.
Why does it appear in English?
There are a few things that might be the cause of this, for example...
- I don't know what it's called in Japanese.
, language test failure
- The browser's settings have given priority to English.
It's an odd number of times, but it's an odd number.
Why is it so hard to do odd numbers?
It's strange.
There's some kind of pattern.
It repeats and continues.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patent, 5/5 China late for the hydrogen economic road map.
The South Korean government has released a hydrogen economic road map for 20'9 years.
By 2022, we had sold 65,000 fuel-powered cars, running hydrogen stations 3-0 in all the country.
So let's say that we have a hydrogen.
This year, however, the fuel-powered car is only 27% of its target on the monthly basis.
It's 38 percent of the target time for the nuclear infrastructure's hydrogen station.
It turns out that the government's hydrogen economic road map is down much of its target.
The National Association of Economics has released a report for two days, called hydrogen economic status and policy direction.
According to the report, most of the core parts and materials of the hydrogen industry depend on the United States and Japan.
The core carbon fiber of the fuel-powered car is supplied by a source such as Tokyo, Japan, Memblen, du Pont (U.S.), Goa (U.S.), and 3M (U.S.).
The number of hydrogen patents in six countries leading the world's hydrogen market (China, United States, European Union, Japan, South Korea and Germany) has increased by an average of 4% a year.
The number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel batteries (20-4-2020) is the fifth in South Korea.
But the whole period said, "In fact, six countries occupy the majority of the world's hydrogen market and, in fact, it means lower among the competitors."
The country-wide patent rank is China, the United States, EU and Japan.
Since the end of the 20'7 year period, China has been spreading its differences since it left the United States.
The number of patents registered in 2020 has reached the fourth place in South Korea over 033 (974).
The entire system suggested that "mium technology should be defined as "the national strategic technology" with a high cost of investment, research and development costs."

US, aid ammunition arrived in Ukraine.
(CN) U.S. Department of State officials have reported that weapons, including firearms and ammunition, have arrived in Ukraine on the basis of a security plan approved by President Biden by the U.S.
Military aid is worth 60 million dollars (U.S.) in total, and the last piece of equipment, including four radar points, will be transported to Ukraine in the morning.
According to the U.S. Department of Defense spokesman Kirby, these aid included deadly weapons such as the anti-tank missile Jabin.
Military support is intended to strengthen Ukrainian national defense, including the military forces moving around the Ukrainian border.
The U.S. has become more aware of the movement of the Russians, has consulted with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and has planned to deal with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
President Byden approved weapons aid when Ukrainian President Selensky visited the White House this September.
The U.S. military support has reached about 45 million dollars this year.
The amount of aid that Russia has received since consolidated the Ukrainian Crimea has increased by more than two and a half billion dollars.
The U.S. Army also served on Ukrainian training.
Last month, we sent state soldiers from Florida, U.S.A., following a joint training program supported by Ukraine.
According to a United States Department of Defense, European Special Forces have also played a major role in the training and advice of Ukrainian Special Forces.
The number of U.S. Special Forces operating in Ukraine has not been revealed as classified operations.
President Byden has had an online meeting with Russian President Putin on 7 this month, but the situation has also been tense in Ukraine.
The United States is also prepared to impose severe economic sanctions when an invasion occurs.

I'm going to shoot the President of the Civil Party for the "return" of inheritances, for the "advised" tax, for the "return of the inheritance and the "addiction" that makes the gift "noble"!
The first feature of the December 18 issue of the Weekly Diamonds is “We Speak as a Family at the End of the Year! ”
It's a gift-and-announcement.
In the course of the discussion about the co-operation of the inheritance tax and the gift tax, the concerned 2022 tax line was seen, but in the near future, the gift will be the forbidden hand.
What does the rule of inheritance change?
With a direct attack on the pre-tax of the National Party, the Council of Commons, we will be informed of the basics of the gift and inheritances that will be available within the year.
I'd like to thank you for your help.
● "No-one" for "No-Second" and "No-Sid" for "No-Trespondents" and "No-Tresponsible Taxes" and "Subjecting and Taxing Taxes" to establish a neutral tax system for the time of the transfer of property." —.
The ruling party announced last year that the tax line of 2021 had a huge shock in both the rich and the middle.
Because what it means is that it changes the rules of inheritance, and it makes an extra tax on the inheritance by making it an illegal gift.
The iron rule of higher inheritance taxes is "less property to be taxed".
Its most powerful bill of livelihood has been used extensively by the rich, as well as by the rich, who have their homes in the three largest cities, to the point that they have a small inheritance tax.
The debate of "Counting the Inheritance Taxes and the Gift Taxes" that fell on them.
Although the 22nd anniversary of the latest introduction was seen in the 22nd anniversary of the tax reassessment of the tax system, “referencing the present inheritance and the pension system” has been revised by a more well-argued statement, such as, “The non-tax action of giving is a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family’s limits.”
In an interview with the editorial department, the former head of the civil government's tax investigation, the former president of Japan's Prime Minister, Tomari, said:
"The advantage of the transfer of property, the loss of the disadvantages, and the equal burden of taxes are the most important.
We're doing a simulation of what's going on right now (by one-on-oneization).
If not, then it would certainly be a good idea to cut off the money in the near future, which would make it impossible for them to pay taxes.
So how do the rules of inheritance tax and gift tax change exactly?

"My right brother," he said, "from January 10, 2022, you'll be on the ground and you'll be in expectation of Segawa Tetsuo."
FOD's original drama "My Right Brother" was decided to broadcast the broadcast on Fuzzi TV from midnight on January 10, 2022.
The original work by Moorzotoshi, a man and woman who have lived in the past, was published in the series of 2018's "BE LOVE", a book by Moorzotoshi.
The main character's name is Hanayama.
I'm a college student, and I'm going to meet my senior high-school teacher.

The drama "My Right Brother" will be broadcast on the ground waves since January 10.
And I hope you'll be able to get a better look at this, and I hope those who haven't seen it at FOD will be able to get a sense of what's going on, and see what's going on, and see the complex psychology of the world, and the conflict, and how these two people are changing.

What was it like for the players who won three games in one pass (BBMports) - Yahoo! News
This game, Jones threw it on the path of "Palitolitz" only three times.
This was the number of NFLs in the last 50 years since Bill's two passes recorded in the third week of 1974 against the New York Jets.
In 1974, Bill Bills had the first known RB of O.J.simpson, over 2,000 yards during the previous season.
Bill's defeated Jts at the Lancet and another RB Jim Braxton.
This time, the biggest reason for the expansion of these extreme O-fences by the Patrítz was in the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and it's not the same at its latitude as the coast of the North Sea.
On this day, the temperature was almost one degree or so and winds were blowing at 18 meters per hour, and before the match was over, it was snowing.
Bill's was only local, and he didn't change his play much.
Twenty-five runs for 30 passes.
Allen's pass is 15/30,145 yards.
There was no intercept, no failure.
There were four Red Zone break-ins and a score machine in a 10-back series.
Especially since the end of the third play, three consecutive times went up to the red zone.
I only got three FGs in those three times.
The final goal for the final game.
Bill's followed four points, he committed the penalty at 3rd and 9 and he became 3rd and 14.
18 yards to the finish line.
At 3rd and 14th, QB Allen was surrounded by the rush of the Paitriotsdi fence and ran out of his pocket to the right.
And then he tried to throw a pass at TEdoson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
At this play, the right-hand side of the game was free in front of the end zone when Aece WR stephon Diggs was running through the shadow of the cross, but it seems Allen didn't see it.
4th & 18th, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis running from the left to the end zone, but the path ended in failure when he was beaten by DBmith Bryant in Port-au-Prince.
Bryant was covering the Bill's WR Cole Beasley, but then he saw Allen's movements and let him go and react to the pass.
Allen threw a path at the end zone twice.
The 4th-down path may have been determined, but 3rd-down didn't have to be targeted for TD.
Take the first down on two play.
It's still in front of the 2-mints, so if we had 4th and short, his ability to run would have been alive.

This is the correct course.
It's time to throw away three items that have been left in the kitchen for a long time.
Sponge
It's a sponge that doesn't change as often as it's recommended.
From a study in 2017, we know that even if we infect the kitchen sponge with microwaves every day, it can breed a lot of bacteria.
The German researchers who did this recommend that we change sponges once a week to keep clean.
I don't know.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pointed out that if you start to grind, if you get a scratch or a ditch, you should change the plank.
Because once the wound or the ditch has progressed, it becomes more difficult to keep clean, and bacteria reproduce.
If you're still okay, don't forget to filter out one gallon of water with a liquid bleached with a table spoon.
So let's take a look at the surface of the board.
Dry clean water, dry it naturally, or cut it like a light paper towel.
A broken or broken dish.
It may be painful to dispose of your favorite mugs, but the missing surface becomes a new hotbed for bacteria and bacteriococcus.
And it can cause his lips to cut off or his drink to spill.
Well, it's a chance to buy a new one!

Well, I hope we're still friends.
I know it's just plain normal, but if you're doing it, you might not be able to stop it.
Why don't you talk to me about Japanese rules?
I don't care, my white friends who go home will always make the glasses more expensive than the younger ones when they're having a drink.
I'm definitely aware of it, but I think it's a good habit to be treated like a Japanese.
The Japanese look at such details, regardless of their character.

It is the battle of the "Tones of Vandalism" must be considered.
The exchange of effort is a human hymn.
In a recent cartoon, the most unusual thing about the "survival blade" is that "there are more and more disciplines."
There are almost no battles, and the disciplines to discipline at night have become the theory that readers are not popular.
It was a two-year practice when straw groups were separated from each other in the same jump cartoon.
Well, Wangpi's one of the charms of walking land, and the "remaining in the same place" may not be so compatible.
Now let it be said that the training of the leading hero, Kotoshiro, who was the one who saved his life and begged for the life of a man who was trying to take his life.
A weak man has no right or choice, and he can only be manipulated by powerful men with all his might.
And yet, it was the kindness of the progenitor who introduced me to the near left-hand side of the Reindeer's ranks to train those who wish to join the army.
The first contact between Mr. Coal and the Coal is, "What do you do when your sister eats people?" and the answer is "slow."
It's not fair to talk amongst the fans.
But walking around with a sister who's turned into a demon could lead to such a judgment.
I think it's an incentive to practice.
But he took an amateur who had not yet been trained to take him to a mountain of mist, and told him to come down to the bottom of the mountain by dawn.
The mountains are filled with holes, pebbles, and traps, and they die before they go to school.
Still, it's a "professor correction" to detect the faint smell of a trap that was planted by human hands with a keen sense of smell.
"But it doesn't happen so quickly enough that you can avoid all of that!"
It's just that ordinary people don't have any background, don't have any strength, don't wake up, can use the power and skill that they've been polishing up to that point with their potential.
For those who strive, they pay only in the least, and they do not repay anything for their efforts. The exchange of effort is a human hymn, unlike the demons who have no authority, and a rule which is hard to follow in their work.
Is this old?
They say they're not sleeping yet, but they're sleeping in a mat, a mat, a blanket.
My house isn't an apartment.
That's what I'm doing.
It's better to sleep with a blanket than with a bed if you're going to use a room.
I think there's a lot of people like that.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
Is there someone who works part-time, who works part-time with someone else, who doesn't want to work full time?
No, I don't think so.
So I'm going to have to borrow.
And I think it's a little bit of a "difficult" thing to do to make more than the effort with this minimum effort.
Is there any place in the country that's not smoking?
I do it everywhere.

South Korea's Samsung electron has created a new "DX division" that integrates home power mobiles, highlighting user experience (WW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Samsung continued to be integrated into the set division of CE and IM, decided that the name was DX (Device EXperience), and announced on the 12th that it would reflect this in the year-end organizational reforms.
Through mobile-to-home services, you can see the idea of strengthening your experience.
Samsung has revealed that the new DX sector, which has combined CE and IM, comes from a project such as VD (Visual System), Live Electric, Medical Device, MX (Mobile eXperience), and Networks.
Samsung explained that this change of name reflects a middle-term business structure, future-mindedness, global leadership.
He added that TV, home appliances, smartphones, and communications products, as well as that they emphasize the intention of consumers to enjoy their optimized experience with a service solution that reflects their customer needs.
The initiatives of the Integrated Leadership, the creation of collective synergy across the boundaries of the organization, and the building of the basis for discriminated products and services were also reflected in the name.
Samsung has already devised a strategy that allows users to access content and services freely through the Internet (IOT) and artificial intelligence-based telephones and smartphones of the device, through the MDE, Multiment Experience Council.

> They appeared, with themselves, with the entire body from the sand.
I'm going to show you how it works. <i> The little nymph waits in the sand to catch his prey at any time and only the disk-shaped head appears from the sand. <i>
It's a little unnatural.
The larvae of the nymph lie in the sand in wait for their prey, and only the disk-like heads can be seen from the sand.
And I think that's what we should do.
I don't care. I don't care.
* Have you been referring to any other documentary?
* Or is it from an ant's point of view?
So let's see if we can do that.
When we translate a disk-like head into a disk, we think that part of the ant's scale is "a huge, covered beast."

Nomura suspect trailers continued without brakes after the accident, and fire protection confirmed that Nomura suspects were unconscious at one time shortly after the accident.
But according to the investigators, there are no suspects in the village, and they are seen as some kind of misbehavior.
The police are searching the homes of the people involved and checking the situation at the time.

You're X's meat manrevoret, week PreNEWS - Yao! News
The 20th Olympics of meta-humans started in the third volume have been completed in this four volumes!
It's full of new tricks focused on only one battle, in contrast to the one that's been drawn from the opening to the semi-final!
● "Kin meat man" Book 4 Review Poster
The four volumes are, in a word, a piece of the finals of the Kim-Man versus Robin Mask, and I want to hold them down first, but they are not just the ones that draw the game on the ring.
It's hard to go to a game, starting with the signing ceremony, where each other's fighting, training, and so forth, but it's not boring.
This feeling of growing tension that begins in the first half of the century is very close to the rise of the tension in our readers, and it seems to me that even this period of time is quite calculated.
And before the important final, there's a third battle between the Terrymans and the ramenmens.
I love the luxury of the game, but it's my turn to get rid of the Kim-Man poster in front of the game."
And try to beat chops.
But the scene of the happened to be when the Terrymans stopped the sword and stood in silence, and they just broke up.
What's so great about this is that both of them have already fallen out, and we don't have a chance to fight Kin-Man in this convention anymore.
But there's such a thing as a pain in the ass over that meat man.
If you can see this, you can't help but think of the far-off future!
This is what makes character stand, and I am still a comic writer!
The fight between the two of you ends with a little less timing, but the scene is a cry from Lumenman's tears after the match.
Don't count on the strength of God's luck towards Kin's meatman!
So let's say that I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to write
I don't know if this is a great meta-word to the work, but I think that our readers are in the end the main characters, and that's why we're so much better off than we are not good.
But by letting Lumenman make this statement, Mr. Rahmen has been able to stab his hands with lies even above himself.
In these words, the reader says, "Oh, so the Kin's meat man takes down Robin by force?"
How?
And if you look at it from a writer's point of view, it's as if the teacher had to tie himself up to make a piece.
I thought this was a great thing to do.
So let's see.

The Winter Illimination weekend in Yoichi, Japan (FBC FBC Fukui broadcast) - Yahoo! News
The first winter Illumination in Habar Village in all of Shanghai, Japan, has begun, and the park is covered with a gentle light.
(Nov. 2) The winter Ilmination started on the 26th of February is littered with 50,000 LED light bulbs along a 20-meter-a-foot-a-kid tree, along with sidewalks and lawns.
A visitor from Chiaga Prefecture said, "I've been to Fukui for a long time, and I'm surprised that there is a place like this.
She said, "It's so beautiful, it's so nice."
The Illimination was first organized to avoid the confusion and to feel healing, which is lit up from 5 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
And on the last 25th day, we will have a Christmas event with buttonspots and film shows.
I don't think there's a lot of people who can read the documents in order.
When I heard a friend who was really good at reading it, he was able to do it, but he was kind of good at it from the base of Linux, and he was reading it from a reference book rather than a document, where he was interested.
It's much easier to learn from Linux than it is to talk about something that's more abstract than something like this.
It's hard to get it all figured out.
I wish I knew.

We're not going to be able to do anything about it.
On the 11th day, an agricultural council made up of cities and JA and other places in the gift district launched a PR operation on the farm that used "livecommouss" to sell products on the Internet.
For the first time in Tokyo's port city, the loving soldiers from the National Union MINTO (and all) MarketTV made a remote appearance and brought the local charms along with their products.
A "Global Opening Project" project was launched on the basis of a collaboration between the gift districts and the port districts.
This is an example of the attraction among nature-stuffed areas.
I've also given you a stew party with the love general.
At the Tokyo studios, we test out some of the wines, wines, rice cows, and princesses that were given to us by the Japanese river village, Emiko, and more than 300,000 registered in the city.

Is there any way to post what we got in the form on the same PHP page?

We're losing power on the NAS computer.
What happened?
Open the window for ventilation in the morning.
It's on the PC.
2.) After a while, I go back to my room and I notice that there's a pink roller sound on my computer, and I shut it down first.
At this point, we thought the fans were only getting worse by falling in room temperature (6° C).
So we're going to try it again.
3.) Do not start.
Power button pressed for a moment and the fans were moving, but they stopped immediately.
I won't say anything after that.
I'll pull the plug and try again, but it'll only take a second.
( 4.) Only the motherboard and ATX20 pins are connected, remove the other parts and don't start.
( 5.) They suspect that PSU's fans have been hitting something and that it was due to the noise of the bubububububbub.
I'll try to find the extra ATX power later.
Maybe.
I don't know what to do if I don't.

A soft atmosphere, valued by modern communication, requires drawing characters!
So let's think about what we're doing here.

First place is 5% of the total number of drawing characters used!
I'm going to use the first, third, and fifth tear marks.
So let's do that.
I don't think many people use their own self for the moment or for the feeling that they can't control it.
It's not that simple, but it's a very simple way of doing it.
So let's say I want to write it like this.

There's a high chance we'll split up.

I don't think it's a good idea.
