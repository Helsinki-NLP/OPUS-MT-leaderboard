Report on the whole cut (CanCam.jp) - Yahoo! News
I'm going to add a layer to the heavy Semlong, and then I'm going to add a layer to the hair.
It's called the "CanCam Model" because it says, "It's beautiful, but it's professional, and I admire it!"
I was asked by Sunlight-san of SUNVALY, who is in charge of cutting her own hair.
Report that cut process!
Yamasaka Yamasaka, Mizuki, short hair, first cover!

It's not easy, it's not easy, it's easy, it's just a balance that lives on.

So, if you put a layer around your face, it makes it easier for you to move.
So, if you're looking at a hair, you're looking at a hair.
If you cut the hair on the bee, you cut it together, and then you cut it around the face.
I'm going to take the top of the hair off the face, and I'm going to cut the ends a little bit.
This makes it easier to move when the hair is lowered.

But only the food bar, which is said to have more than 20,000 stickers, remains in the "10,000" stores.
So Governor Kimura says, "I'm going to get to the end of the month, but I'm going to put out a declaration sticker when I'm going to make an appointment, and then I'm going to make an appointment."
He said, "It doesn't matter if you're in the city of the Night, you need to separate clearly between the one that's doing the infection and the one that's not doing it.

I've been in an accident on a new operation.
In the bike class that was opened as the start of the operation, there was an experiment of car and bicycle collisions.
In recent years, the Tokyo Police Department has begun Operation "By-By-By-B" in an effort to eliminate the high rate of bikes and motorcycle accidents that occur in the pipes.
In addition to promoting safety awareness in the tube, we're also going to take up the control and reinforcement of bike traffic laws.
This year, there were three traffic deaths and a person driving a motorcycle or a bike died.
While the number of accidents is declining, the rate of bike accidents is about 11.7 per cent as of June 30, the number of motorcycle accidents is about 5.8%, each of which is about 5.8% higher than the average in the province.
In the last five years, especially in bike accidents, many of them have more than the average in the state.
The mission's name is "bike" and "bicyble" and it's meant to eliminate the accident.
The group will be called to more than ever by driving instruction for the elderly and using reflectors for transportation and safety classes.
It's called a yellow card, which is used to alert the police.
The operation's opening ceremony took place on the 21st, at the Car Training School in Okinawa City.

This game, won by 104-98, by Duncan Robinson, was a team high at 18 points, and by Tyler Hero, 15 scores and backcoats.
Of course, Robinson, one of the league's top shooters, is the 13th-ranking router, the hero's step up is an important element for the heat.
The hero missed 15 games from February to March due to injuries to his ankle, and his last season was a long pause on the 12th of March.
The hero said he was able to regain 100 percent of the state of affairs because he had plenty of time.
The hero's play time increased because he was too late to meet his former lead guard Kendrick Nang.
It's worth 15 points on a different role.

"He can handle handlers, he can take scores, he can take scores, he can do diadems, he can do anything for a team, he can do anything for a team, he can do anything for a team, he can do it because he's not thinking about it.
Before the start of the season, Butler loves the strength of the hero's rooky spirit and the squick attitude to work with Vasquez.
That's why I invited you to start at 4 a.m. and train with me.
Butler once said that he would say his opinions to no one, he would not back down, that such a fighter could be respected.

A singing world with the people of Fukushima, Japan, has created a gathering of six musicians from Fukushima province.
I'd like to sing the lively song of the beach, the middle and the sea...
A group of 16 musicians from Fukushima province formed a message song.
In a song, he writes about Fukushima's dazed struggle with the new Corona virus, as he moves on to recovery from the disaster of Japan and Tokyo Fukushima 1.
We will blow through the voices of the people of the province and finish the complete version by next summer, when the next decade will be over.
Twenty-four days ago, the song was released on YouTube.
The song is called "Prey from Fukusima."
I'm going to put people on the positive side of Fukushima to a bright and healthy melody.
The musical center of the live house, which is based on a new corona, has been forced to work, and many musicians have lost their place to sing and play.
That's when I can't see, and I want to believe in the power of the music.
Napoo is in charge of words and songs, Dazo is in charge of rap.
When the project began in March of the Corona disaster, the Japanese singer, MANAMI (28), from Fukushima City, and Shizuno-san (38) became more and more in favor, and the circle spread quickly.
Napoo says with a sense of humor that she wants to enjoy the occasion more than she can ever imagine.
We didn't set a chance for 16 people to be infected, each recorded in a live house or at home.
In an attempt to support the project, the artist in the city drew down an image of the character.
It goes through Fukushima and describes the green and natural climate.
The final song will be broadcast to the world on YouTube, and for CD.
The Tokyo Olympic Paralympic will be held next year after the earthquake and will be postponed.

Detecting a crisis from online information immediately, and judging by the problem (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
"I want to know where the disaster and accident happened."
This is not limited to the news media, such as television and newspapers, but also to many companies, such as social infrastructure and municipality.
The services that respond to that are developed by Spectee, who is using AI to analyze information.
A team of experts will test social media information to be false in an arbit from [Photo] Specti
Now, the first way people know about disasters and accidents is moving from TV to online information.
Social media, such as Twitter, has become an important source of information right after a disaster or an accident.
It's not easy to keep an eye on information that overflows and extracts useful information from it by hand.
Spenty detects and analyzes natural disasters and accidents from social media, such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and then analyzes the content of the information and then identifies the information as true, and then distributes it to companies.
It's called a wide-scale crisis of negative impacts that could stop or stop social activity.
NHK was the first major use of Spektee during the April 2016 earthquake, and since then, there has been a rapid spread among businesses.
More than 350 companies in the country, including television stations, newspapers, and other news outlets, are now using Spenti, including companies supporting the infrastructure of power, gas and transportation, as well as governments across the country.
▪ Parsing posts to determine the type of crisis and the location of the event.
Specti distributes information in four steps: collecting information, parsing and classification, title, and true and false.
The companies must specify areas to collect information (e.g., urban and urban areas) and a critical category (such as disasters or accidents).
The post collects its specific posts using the API provided by social media.
Next, analyze and classify the text, images, and videos that are included in the collected posts.
For example, if a fire car is on, there's black smoke coming out of the building, and there's an orange flame coming out of the room, we can sort it into a fire.
In other words, if you're in a car, you're in a car, you're in a car accident, and if you're on a water road, you're sort of like a road cap.
It also estimates where disasters and accidents occur.
"We often don't know where the posts are from, so we're guessing of various kinds of information in combination," says Murayama.
For example, if the image or video has a street sign or a sign, we can extract the location information from it and match the location with the local database.
Ensels, the battle is over.

The fifth round, received at 1-1, met the second-hand right-hand Petitt on the first base, and fell into a pit.
The eighth round we met in the 2-1 and 1 1 lead against the 5th-hand Deakman.
He went straight to the second ball and turned backward, but fell to the left instead of over the fence.
Ensels has met us in the eighth, second, second, second, second, second, but only nine, and the second, the second, and the second, Castro, the first team of this season.

The Great Valley was the last of nine strikers, so it was the second.
Ensels is on the 10th, and the first striker, Walsh, is on the hard first floor, but first base Olson, who liked the ball, is on the third floor.
The Great Valley between the two and three stories became a touch-out.
Ensels made it a dead ground, until the eighth, Simmons, fell into a pit.
In the back, Ensels was a dead man, two, three-point pins.

The word "multure" was used in a conversation with a friend of the university.
So let's say I'm going to use it.
- Are you sure it's going to be a cheating and cheating?
So let's think about what that means.
And then one more thing.
It wasn't until I was grown up that I learned that the word "home" was not used at all when I read books and that I didn't hear from my friends.
- What, did you say, "My mom"?
I use it in my community, but I didn't realize it was because I grew up and didn't use it naturally...
Japanese "cold Chinese" doesn't like Chinese...?
It's a cold noodles dish, not popular in modern business.
It's cold in China.
As mentioned at the outset, cold Chinese is based on the Chinese "colouren" (Lanbanmien/colour) and the Chinese Chinese dish from Japan.
So, although it doesn't exist in China originally, it's starting to look like a Japanese restaurant in summer.
And recently, the traditional conveniences of conveniences have appeared in Japan’s convenience stores, which have been labeled ‘ Cool and Cold China ’ and ‘ Yuan Chiri - Yuan - Yuan - Yuan - Yuan - Yuan - Yuan - Yuan - Yuan - Yuan - Yuan - Yuan. ’
On the other hand, Chinese food, such as Shizukawa and Lake South, has been pushed into popular Chinese food with punches.
Of course, the flavors of Chinese Chinese are often familiar to Chinese people.
So, it's not bad, but it tends to be notorious for lack of impact.
The "cold Chinese" is not an exception, but is still a minor in China.
In China, the name for the cold Chinese name is “Sunday Cold. ”
The Chinese are recognized as one of the Japanese dishes.
Summer's set for the cool skin.
Speaking of the summer-stinning noodles in China, I wonder if it's a "colnpy".
A lot of people in Japan may not be familiar with it, but the cool skin is a bowl made of rice flour, rice flour, and dumplings.
It's said that there's been 2,000 years of history.
The price is 10 to 20 gulmés sold in the store counters, around and around.
It's called "col," but it's not ice-free like the cold Chinese in Japan.
Rather, it's the basis of constant temperature.
And then they will take some of the ingredients they like, such as cucumbers, carrots, lentils, and so forth, and add them to the taste of spices such as pakchi, peppers, carrots, and garlic.
Finally, it is finished with a special flavored mixture of oil, rye, vinegar, marihuana and peanut paste.
Its acidity is so rich and rich that it can easily get stuck in a bowl over the throat, even when it is dark and hungry in the summer.
Because of the perturbation throughout China, there are various toppings and flavorings, and rich variations are also characteristic of cool skin and one of the most enjoyable ways to enjoy it.
Experts explain!
"Chosmopolitan" is the benefit of cold water showers on your body and mind.
It's called muscle pain.
A study of the effectiveness of Hydrotherapy, published in The North American Journal of Medicine, found that physical and mental healing effects can be expected.
A cold water bath after exercise can reduce muscle pain and other inflammation effects.
As Professor Douglas Casa, director of the Sports Medicine Research Institute, who teaches at Connecticut University, says, "It is important to exercise and take a cold shower without opening up as much time as possible.
Reduce fatigue.
It's said that exercise in hot climates causes the heart, muscles, and skin to need more blood flow.
In the case of the skin, there's a lot of blood flowing through the heart, because the heart rate is high, and the muscle needs energy to contract, and more blood is pumped into the body to regulate the body's temperature.
"A cold shower will reduce the blood flow to the skin, so that the temperature of the skin will cool down, and the flow of blood to the skin will then be sent to the internal organs, such as the stomach, which will make water and nutrients more likely to be consumed after exercise.
I'm looking forward to the Hormisis effect.
So, we're going to talk about this in the next video.
So, the idea is that formalisis effects are a little bit better off than nothing at all.
"Basic exercise, predation, and cold showers are typical of what we expect to do with the formalis of health: cold water showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters, and increase physical and physical strength and resilience."

The high-frequency ball will be shot to the left middle of the left wing.
The Great Mountain's two-war-time arch, circled the diamond.
When I went back to the bench, I looked at my white teeth.
"In the midst of the great swing, I was able to squeeze the ball of aim and take it out of the way."
Four zero twos, we're in the first row.
This is the first one.
I couldn't miss the 34-kilo slider.
The ball is a perfect hit to be sure it stands in the moment it hits the core.
The last two shots followed by the 23rd day of Hiroshima were the result of a backlash.
I hit someone I didn't like, and it was worth it.
"In the 7th day of the fight against Nono-Shuo, the 4th score and the 4th score were nine.
But according to the Nagoya Dome, he suffered from seven defeats in the last two games, seven defeats, 20 defeats, and the last one from August 23, March.
The Nagoya Dome took 23-year-olds from such a formidable opponent, and they didn't give it the direction of the game.
The director said, "It's a high level to be able to hold the sweet ball, and it's a high level to watch it, and the timing to do it, and I think it's still going to blow."
I've got a right-handed shot at one, mark the six-fight round and three-tone round.
The curtains have started to go up, but seven-pointed, "6 has already been at the top and fourth of the team.

On the 25th day of the 25th, Iwako Ishiko Ishii, a Japanese man-in-de-man of Japan, responded to the press and resolved to "I want to join forces to win the medal for the goal" that has been postponed the next year.
In response to a 5-year delay, 20-year-old Rio de Janeiro champion Coca Cora and 5-year-old member of the 5-man race, Panasoni, who has been on the World Cup for 9 years, have left the team.
The commander said, "Of course, it's a big impact, but we're going forward with the players."

In Nagano, for the first time in 40-year-olds at the Red Cross Hospital, we're going to run a PCR test for all of our contacts.
It turns out that 40-year-old women in Nagano, Japan, are infected with the new corona virus.
I'm an employee of the Red Cross Hospital, and I'm the first medical worker in the province to be infected.

Women work on the 16th, and visits outside the province are not confirmed for the first two weeks.
We're currently investigating the path to infection.
The Women's Red Cross Hospital announced that there was an infected staff on the 24th night of the day.
So, the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go to the hospital and we're going to run a PCR test on all of the people in the hospital, and shut down the wards where women are involved, and then we're going to be completely decontamination.
The Macao Casino authorities have examined the treatment of the quarantine treatment in casino facilities...a new version of the Corona virus at the time of entry (Macao newspaper) - Yahoo! News
About 40 casino facilities in Macao have resumed their operations on strict quarantine measures since February 5 to 19.
The Macao Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) calls for re-operating and maximum protection of the health of employees and guests, providing distance between tables and casinos (e.g. 3-4 people at the table game) and a single or two slot machines, as well as a reduction in the risk of infection.
There's also been enhanced anti-infectation of chips and other gadgets.
Also, guests are required to offer a mask at the time of entry, a wake-up call, a good health code, a recent stay, a new contact with Corona patients, a fever or cough, or a contact with them.
At 0 a.m. on July 15th, the offer of a new corona viral nucleic acid test (only within the effective period of Macao or Guangzhou's approval facility) was joined.
The setting where a new negative certificate is required is at 6 a.m., at 6 a.m., a reduction in water control between Macao and Canton province (with 14 days of quarantine and conditions), which is a precaution.
The DICJ, after a change from July 18, announced that its directors, Adriano Ho, visited the operation of the quarantine in casinos, as well as a meeting to gather security representatives from the six casinos to ensure the health of the employees and guests by having a thorough management of the housing of the guests.
In the DICJ, a strict patrol patrol of casino facilities continued, provided regular meetings with the operating company for the circumstances and evaluation, and, along the government's guidelines, provided adequate control of the quarantine measures in the casinos.
The inspection of the casino facility has also been accompanied by chief forest pines from the Health Department's Center for Disease Control and has been instructed on how to digest the chips at the scene and how to take safe distances between the seats of electronic casino equipment.
However, due to the sharp decline in the number of inbound travelers with the restrictions, the annual casino sales in June and June have increased from 77.4 percent to 37.2 billion macaopataka (about $4.5 billion).
Ale of light from the hot spring next month, instead of a bland festival, send a message to the medical staff.
The new corona virus has caused the annual hot springs to cease, starting with August, with a message of support for health care workers.
The city of hot water is wrapped up in the light of ale to bring healing to visitors.
It's an animated event with hot water springs modeled by the Hot Springs Tourism Society.
It starts in the year 20 when the cartoons were broadcast, and every year thousands of animators come from all over the country.
"Every day from the lights of July to the main festival, every day, from the night of the week to the night of the week, we have to light it with a light on the stairs leading to the hot water-basin shrine.
This year we were forced to stop the festival because of the new Colona, but local and national fans have repeatedly told us that we miss it in the summer, and the Society proposed the project.
He wanted to help in some way to heal and heal the world in its misery in Corona.
In addition to having about 50 children write illustrated messages from around the country, there are over "00 applications from all over the country.
The message paper is purchased from the Society's website, and then sent in a reply envelope and sent to the Society, where you can get photos of the light on it.
"In a set of 6,000 yen, you will apply until you reach about 350 wild animals.
I'm going to have to get to the end of the month.
Shinichi Yamaguchi, who has been chairman of the festival since the first time, said, "When we read the message, we are encouraged too.
For the campaign, we have created a flowering character and an illustration of the Asano bridge.
"From day to day, I will send a clear file to the special resident planner of the hot springs.
A core of the West Army's core 4 forest roots (East spoweb)
This is the second good-bye of the season.
The 24-day Battle of Rotttenlife, 2-2-9 times, showed the obsession with victory by the four still far away from the book.
Heads and heads raced from safety vant to first base.
This is the first time I've ever seen anything like this.
On this day, the 4th mountain river was broken off, and the forest and the 5th place were replaced by the one that returned to Tokida's path.
I thought that I was in the bench, and that I had no choice but to take care of him.
In the third year, the two-year-olds, the two-year-old forest, the mountain rivers, the four-year-olds, the three-year-olds, and the four-year-old head of the field, the fieldhands called "the heart of our home."
They have a lot of experience with generals in the amateur era and a lot of responsibility.
On the other hand, I'm not a good-spoken deputy captain, so I talk to him, and I stand behind him.
I thought that was the sign, but I thought that was the best way to go.
All four of them are now suffering with a 20/40/5 chance of being beaten, but they support their team with the wisdom to win even if they can't.

There was an opening in the front yard of the cast-piercing community center, where local and administrative officials celebrated the completion.
He's a veteran of the New Year's War, a Western scholar, a doctor.
After standing on the platform at the Institute of Research and Education of Western Sciences in the Act, the Doppler Hall opened in Edo and taught orchids, military sciences, and medicine.
Even after I went back to Shibuya, I gave a military lecture at the Yamaguchi Court.
The statue focused on the education of the next generation.
I stood by the globe and took a book and shaped it to give a lecture on orchids.
The height of the platform is said to be about three meters (about 55 meters).
The design was handled by the wife of the Hanero Hanamoto, a descendant of the harko, a local designer (27).

Colona's Art close to the online museum, HASARD.
I'm going to show you an art museum.
From famous painters like Claude Monet and Gustav Klimut, to anonymous artists in the country.
Since the opening of the building in April 2019, "Hasard" has captured the user's heart from its convenience and newness, and the opportunity for a new way of life by the cholera plague has increased.
The site's founder, Yuno Nono, who lives in Tokyo, says, "Everyone wanted to create a service that is easy to enjoy, and under difficult circumstances, they want to touch the arts."
It is amazing to see the beauty and beauty of the exhibition.
Today, the 24th day, we have 14 permanent and planned exhibitions that attract people not only to the colors but also to the quality of their pens.
It's not necessary to register members, it's not necessary to pay entrance fees, not only for the viewer, but also for the artists who want to hold the exhibition.
If it's online, it's a good way to show it.
That's one way to move the painting.
"The permanent exhibition of Claude Monet" starts again, digitally processing the clouds, flowers, meadows and so forth.
"I want to make sure that those who are less interested in art can get in."
I'm going to show you a few examples.
When my family and I arrived at the newly completed Aomori Museum at the time, we were shocked by the three huge paintings of Mark Shagare 'Aleco.
From the next day, the art courses changed at a fun time, and even after I left school, I was able to carry my legs to the gallery and so on.
At the same time, I felt that the exhibitions, where the museum was not near, were only held in the capital, and that there were many people who didn't have much access to art in a variety of ways, such as raising children and making it difficult for them to leave home.
So I spent about two months working with an IT company and set up a website where I could enjoy art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months.
If you can see art in a free form when you want to see it.
Azar's aim was to get more people to see him.
It is important to remember that the representatives of Hanaoka are an artist who will enhance his imagination about the meaning of art.

A simple reason for the end of the Chinese Age of Quality (modern business) - Yahoo! News
Change of values in pandemics.
There are many predictions and debates about the world of Attah Pandemic.
In business terms, the article on July 8 is now out of business.
Japanese people don't know the true strength of Japan... the unexpected reality they saw in Asia.
It also seems to me that there is a mainstream of "completely burning" in the June 26 article, the June 10 article, the rioting, the re-evaluatement of "the Lord's Prayer in Times of Distress," and so on.
And what seems to be a combination of the two substances (economic and business) and the spirit is a huge stream of Chinese to Japanese quality.
For example, if there is a defect in a T-shirt or a big turtle, it's annoying, but there's no point in the life of the purchaser.
On the other hand, China's latest topic of conversation with a mask and a respirator... the "China Quality" in such a life and safety-threatening product is fatal.
You can't buy a product like that, even if it's cheap.
They'll want a product of Japanese quality even at considerable cost.
Of course, this trend is not just happening in Japan.
It's clear from the fact that Western countries, in spite of their lack of masks and medical equipment, have been in a difficult situation, yet they have given back their ‘China Quality’ more and more.
Safer than cheap.
It's also a product, like cars, that can be fatally damaged.
No matter how cheaply China’s selling strategy is used, the article on June 16 won, and the world's auto manufacturer bows down to Toyota?
And it reminded me that many other products also need "sustenance and security".
And security and security is important not only in the quality of Japanese production, but also in the quality of Japanese services, such as fashion streams.
Some of them have a proper capacity for production, such as toilet paper disturbances.
And, like the article, "Who really is behind the mask shortage on April 17?", the self-sustainment in Japan is also an important factor in security and security.
It is very important that each country have its own priorities and that it be able to provide for its own needs, such as masks and food.
South Korea's new Koorona infected with over 100 people in the last 115 days.
South Korea's Central Center for Disease Control announced that on the 25th day, at midnight this day, the number of people infected with the current version of the Corona virus increased from 0 a.m. to 113 a.m. the day before, with a total of 13,4092.
It's the first 115th day since April 1st, that's 100 new cases per day.
In addition to finding out that 32 sailors were infected by Russian ships entering Busan port, 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th day were tested positive.
The number of new cases in Korea was 30 to 60, except for 20 days (26 people).
Of the new infections released on 25th, 86 were foreign immigrants, the largest number since January 20th, the first one in South Korea.
The largest number of people from Iraq, 34 from Russia, 5 from the Philippines, and 3 from the United States.
On the other hand, there were 27 cases in the city, 11 cases in Seoul and Kyoto, and 5 cases in Busan.
Busan City was an employee of a mechanic aboard a Russian ship.
The death toll has continued the day before, with a total of 298.
I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do.

This year, the rainy season is the year when the annual rainfall is high.
It's a hot, hot, hot day, and it's just going to get worse.
So, we've been talking about global warming, which is a global problem, and we've been trying to figure out how to make it a little more comfortable over hot summers.
One way to do that is to dress in thin, white clothes.
You know, you don't have to wear black clothes that absorb heat in the summer.
And they're using the same principle for the building of houses, and more and more cases of using white paint.
So, what we're going to do is we're going to look at the image of the image and see if white is white, but can't reflect more light and be a characteristic paint that doesn't absorb heat.
Recently, Henry Squill of the University of California at Los Angeles, UCLA, has joined with researchers from the Columbia University's Applied Physics and Applying and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University in order to find ways to mix white paints that can be turned back to the sun with the most efficient efficiency, thereby raising the cooling effect on the interior of the building.
It's about early practicalization.
So here's what we're going to do.
The white paints that are already used as oxides have been applied to the roof of high-heated buildings and have been used to cut the sun's heat and increase air quality.
However, new paints have been found, such as the Teflon frying pan, which is derived from polytaphylor ethylene (PTFE) oil.
And this is a very good example of what we're going to do.
Even in hot summers, it is easy to stay in the house unheated because of the unexpected use of tefron.
It's not just a dream, it's a dream.
Japanese roofs seem to be a lot of dark colors, but from now on, white people are becoming mainstream?
When's the annual big Amazon sale, this year?
US CNBC reported on July 21.
Every July, it was announced that this year is being postponed because of the spread of the new Corona virus.
▪ Publication officer, "The details will be announced soon," said the Amazon publicist in a statement.
"Prime Day has become a special celebration for which we look forward to the past five years.
However, the date of the event was not revealed, as it would be said, "The details will be announced soon."
Meanwhile, we decided to host the event in India.
Press release on the country's site.
He explained that on August 6th, it will take from 0 a.m. to 48 hours.
Prime Day has been held at the world's same time, but this year it may take unusual measures.
▪ In 2015, the Amazon set up a large-scale sales scheme to promote sales in summertimes where sales are down.
At first, it was a 24-hour event, but each year it expanded, and last year it was held in 18 countries, including the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, and Australia, between 0 and 48 hours a.m.
According to the company last year, sales for two days exceeded sales for Black Friday and Cyberman Day.
The event also contributed to the acquisition of new members of the pay membership, Prime, which last year reached the highest number of requests for the first day, followed by the next day.
And last year, they sold 155 million goods worldwide.
In this regard, an Internet reporter for the Internet industry reported that the world's total sales for two days had been 776 million (about 70 million dollars) a year, a 70 percent increase over the previous year.
Transmitting cell numbers, being too hard to hold.
What about the fees and points?
(New Switch)
The Ministry of General Affairs is making a real effort to review the transition system (MNP) that allows traditional phone numbers to be changed.
At the 21st day of the conference of experts, we showed a policy to modify the MNP guidelines that were established in 2004.
There are many specific points, such as how to charge MNP and how to stop those who want to get out of the country.
As the reaction from communications companies can be expected, there is a growing interest in how to promote healthy market competition.
In the early 2006, when MNP was introduced, it cost users 2,000 yen, but now it's 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee for the three largest mobile communications companies is estimated at $19.9 billion a year.
In the 21st day, the Ministry of Affairs listed the status of the MNP at a working group (WG) to verify competition rules that discuss the competitive environment of the communications market.
The time for the delivery of the MNP number that consumers need to transfer to other communications companies has been cited.
The main communications companies are accepting it on the web, but it's usually 9-20 hours in range, for example, to manage the base system.
The WG material clearly stated that it is the direction of the future, and that it is the principle of the whole day.
It's also a problem for those who hope to be transferred to MNP to stop by giving them points and so on.
It's a decision that can disrupt the fair race.
A partner at the WG National Institute for Economic Benefits, Nakamura, suggests that "it is important to issue numbers quickly, with permission from users to explain the economic benefits to them, and with a number that is not allowed, first of all, to get the process done."
But in a series of arguments, "the higher the customer's rate, the more likely the customer's flow is, the harder it is to motivate them to slow down."
If there are investors who take the MNP fee first, they are concerned about the flow of customers from the company and the lack of reward for their efforts.
The Ministry of General Affairs has pointed out that many countries abroad are not asking for the cost of the user's burden on the MNP, which could happen in Japan.
The Ministry of the Ministry wants to put the results of the WG together as a report in about nine to ten October and then begin the process of modifying the MNP guidelines.
The time for the amendment to take place is seen after the 21st year.
Cell phones, including sales and customer support, are going to be disturbing.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

U.S. media "CBS Sports" told the story on 22nd (23nd Japanese time).
R Sox Bets is a great talent!
I can do something other than baseball!
Bets was a major review at the age of 21 in 2014.
We've contributed to the team as the center of Boston Red Sox's powerful strike line and as a powerful right-hander.
It's like the top of a middle-range hiter who registers more than 40 doubles every year from 2015 to the last season.

The Broadcasting Council of the United States has agreed on an evening TV show (HIV) - Yahoo! News
A conference has been held to discuss broadcast shows on Fukushima Central TV.
The program's conference had a discussion about the "Goji!!!" part, which broadcasts at 3 p.m. on Monday and Friday at 3 p.m. (June 7th).
While the program is concerned about the new corona virus, it's about how to prepare for natural disasters, how to stretch at home, and so on.
While the committee said, "I think it was the right thing to do during the rainy season and to alert people to the fact that I want to value a sense of beneficial information," the comment was, "I'm busy and I'm in a hurry to get a sense of what's going on, and I'm going to need a tool to call many people."
New colona infection, Craster, no trouble in business.
Kofu City has announced that a man in his 30s in the city has been infected with the new corona virus.
The new infection was confirmed by a male employee in his 30s at the Koku district Fire Department.
This man wasn't the four highly-responsible contacts that have been identified in the Koba district fire headquarters, but this month he was suffering from a fever like this one on the 4th day of the month and showed a positive response to a PCR test.
I'm going to show you a few examples of what I'm going to do.
There are five cases of infection in the South Fire Department, and in the provinces and cities, Crasters are said to have occurred.
There are six other staff members who are suspected of infection, and they are currently doing PCR tests.
In the fire department, it's not going to interfere with the operation by putting a separate team together.
So let's look at this example.
Is there any chance J's debut at Mount FW Tang, 7 years old?
- Yes, sir.
In front of a 25-day-old Shibuya Miyamoto, the director of the Grand Osaka University, in front of a series of 4th-day Knoesta, he expressed his hopes for the first top team member of the first high school team, FW Tangshan, who had joined the first team in the previous year.
The commander of Tangshan, one of the most advanced in this season's flight class, has joined the Bench in the 22nd and Hiroshima war.
I didn't give you an opportunity, but here's the point where J3 takes a point against the striker who's left three scores and results in five games this season: "I'm seven years old, but I want gumsharah to do it more.
Tangshan was a special player at J3 for the last season and "0 match 8 goal."
And in J3, they boast of a five-game goal and an extraordinary score.
Hiroshima was hit by a blow to the FW Ademisson, MF Lowlands, and I had a chance to get out of Tangshan, but I had no chance.
The director of Miyagi and Ademison's "not "00%" state, but he is a generous and prepared man."
If you keep them alive, you'll be able to put a bench in Tangshan again.
In Osaka, MFV = "6 years old" and FWO was "J" at 7 and 0 months old and moved abroad in his 0-year-old generation.
Now, as expected as the next talent, the seven-year-old Tangshan, zero-month-old, will be expected of J-Delete as they follow them.
Twenty-six years ago, the Ferrari was discovered at the bottom of the river.
In 1994, there was a case in the Netherlands where Ferrari Mondial was stolen.
It was too late for the police to solve it, but 26 years later, it was miraculously discovered.
The four Ferraris that were found at the bottom of the river were in submersible training at the fire department.
On July 8th, a training diver found something of a wedge shape that was sinking under a river, and police and even Dutch troops were sent to pick up something, and it was Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIIN number with the stolen car database, the Ferrari could be associated with the 1994 incident.
The car was transferred to the insurance company, the legal owner, and then sent to a scraper.
The scraper, Loie van de Oyevaar, says, "There are still some of the parts left for you to wear, but for the art you're wearing, you're getting many requests from people who want to make a table from broken Mondial.
For the time being, we don't think of any specific sales, and the scrapers keep them as an object like an odje.

JGAP, pig farmer, JGAP - Yahoo! News
On 20 days, the farm visited Mayor Miyayama, Nakata City, and reported that its farm had obtained a "JGAP" that showed the safety of farm produce.
As a farmer in the province, you get the second.
The company is working on the production of "garrick pork" and "gray pig" as a special feed.
This time, about 10,000 of the five farms were herded to get JGAP authentication on the fifth farm, which produces "geo-pigs".
The company sought to get authentication because it realized that it would require authentication to be chosen by the big buyer and that it was a condition for food supplies in the Tokyo Olympic Village.
This past August, with the support of the Aomori Bank, we have been preparing with staff who are qualified to be JGAP leaders.
On March 3 of this year, the authentication agency will review the criteria for 13 items such as food safety.
I got a warrant for 13th of the same month.
The visit was attended by the company's representative, Nakano Nakano, and the branch manager of the company, Ishijima Yamada Yamada, and the company's support adviser.
