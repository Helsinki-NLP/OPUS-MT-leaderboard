Croatia is a nuclear treatment plant. Bosnians are protesting.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in a town in northwest Bosnia to protest the plans of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a beautiful river near the border of Bosnia.
The protesters in the Bosnian town of Novagrado asked Croatia to give up their plans to put the remains of Tulgovska Gora's barracks in storage, and swore to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from a nuclear power plant in Krushko.
Bosnians with banners such as "Do Not Take a Healthful Future" and "The Rivers Need Us," said that nuclear waste disposal facilities could threaten the lives of some 25,000 people who live in and around the Una River.
We must oppose.
The chief of Novigrado's government, Miloslav Driraka, said to the crowd:
We must fight to protect our lives and the river Una.
"The Kulsco nuclear plant, which began its operation in the 980s, is located in Slovenia and is co-hosted with Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will consult next week to discuss the addition of more waste disposal facilities.
On Friday, Croatia's state broadcast reported that Croatia should build its own storage facility, or that it has not yet decided whether to pay for its waste in a newly constructed facility.
Supreme Minister of Environmental Energy Tumislav Cholich told the announcer that Croatia is having problems with public waste disposal of schools, hospitals, and prisons and that he wants to show a complete solution:
In Bosnia, activists, officials, and residents of all ethnic groups in the country insisted that Croatia look for another place to build on the other side of the country near the nuclear power plant.
"Why should Bosnian pants pocket, or Tulgovska Golla, be the perfect place throughout Croatia?"
We can't afford to hurt our self-respect!

Fogiexya.
I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
It may be a reaction to the batik makeup on live, but I, Private Make is a natural.
We're going to talk about some of the things that we've been enjoying lately.
We're trying to find Bess Posi, and we're trying and making mistakes.
It's amazing where you're going, where you're going, where you're going to go, where you're going to go, where you're going to go, where you're going to go, where you're going to go, where you're going to go, where you're going to go, where you're going to go.
My makeup teacher is in the same group.
At the event, they say, "I want to make a makeup for you!"
\Previous makeup/
I like to make the summer-like pop color work so fast!
When we're on the border, we're just trying to be friendly, so makeup's different.
Mavelin's color, Shaw, or-2, put it in your eyes, and it's a little bit smaller, so it's a little more relaxed.
The pink chik is from the rice fields.
So let's see.
Candor's skin is so bright, it's so bright, it's so hot, it's so hot, it's so hot, it's so hot, it's so hot, it's so hot, it's so hot, it's so hot, it's so hot
They'll clean up the hole and the tecaly.
Cezanne, a member of the B.C.
It can be used in the C zone where you see it.
So let's look at this example.
I'm on the "PayPay Saleman" wave.
More taxes on consumption, starting in October.
This is where the country starts.
So, what we're going to do is we're going to reduce the amount of money that we're going to spend to keep the cold ingestion down.
It's a very important thing to do.
So what's happening right now is that we're in a rush.
So let's do a couple more of these.
It's locked in the field of introduction.
▪ Introducing a rush just before the extra tax, and the store and the store are in a hurry to cashless.
I'd like to talk to you about this.
There are more than 100 different types of hits in the store.
We visited the "Pyy Pay" on this day, which is a credit service that boasts 12 and a half million users.
PyPy Yada: "Is there any other way to pay for this account besides cash?"
"No, it's only cash, but it's the old-fashioned..."
PyPy Yada: "I think it would be easier if you'd gotten used to the idea that you'd be able to turn the register faster because you wouldn't be able to pass the change."
So far, we've launched a 10-billion-dollar campaign to put 20 percent of our use back at the point.
We've been building more and more users, and we've been building more and more users.
I've been in the cash business for a while now.
The president also heard from Ms. Tokita and decided to join the PyyPy.
PyPy Yada: "I really think it's the best time to be busy, but if you haven't talked about it before, you're going to be able to do a consumer-responsoring business, and you're going to be able to sign up for PyPy, and you're going to be on the wave."
▪ Get on the wave of cashlessization in the country's consumer reduction system!
The reason he gave it to me for riding the waves was the country's "Reservation of Consumers."
The U.S. government has introduced a system to reduce the amount of consumption to consumers in order to prevent the cooling down of consumption tax since October.
It's not that easy to pay taxes.
Fukuji, who's in charge of the 29th New Year's Festival,
In a new town, near the edge of the city, there's an eightth "New Year's festival" held on 29th.
This year, there's a new version of the NHK series of television novels, with a show showing of the equipment used in the show and the drama to invite Toko Koto.
This is the town's Health and Welfare Center.
"0 shops sell new powders and a cup for 300 yen."
There is also a series of drinking booths, such as foam and crep.
The talk show describes the back story of Fukuji, who played the head of the Yasuda family:
The town hall next to the hall also displays a picture of the horse that the actor Tokisaki performed on Yamada and an old car that Fukuji-san drove in the drama.
What's typical Münchhazen syndrome in Netflix's Politishan?
The symptoms are that parents and parents pretend that healthy children are sick.
The Polityian will be broadcast today at Netflix.
The drama is the story of Payton Hobart for the president of the United States, but first it's the first step to become a student in his high school.
It was produced by Ryan Murphy, American horror stories and Greeley's author, Guwines Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
I'll try to avoid as much publicity as possible for viewers who have not yet had the opportunity to watch the drama, but in the drama I also tell you about the syndrome, which is a psychosis in which the guardian behaves as if the person under its protection is not really sick, although he is physically or mentally ill.
There are different kinds of conditions, but also Münchhazen’s syndrome, which pretends to be sick themselves.
But this is the fact that other people who are clearly protected pretend to be sick.
It's also known as FlII, fake or induced disease, a form of child abuse.
In rare cases, usually, parents overstate or cause symptoms, making the child appear sick.
So, what are some of the symptoms of the typical Munich syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease change in case case, but NHS takes note of the following:
Children seem healthy and try to convince medical personnel that they are sick.
It's an overstatement, or a false symptom.
They fake the results to make their children think they are sick, such as mixing glucose with a urine sample and making them appear to be diabetic.
Overuse of medicines and other drugs causes symptoms of the disease on purpose.
How common is the surrogate Münchhazen syndrome?
It's hard to see how widespread this syndrome is because many cases are not reported.
A study published in 2000 estimated that 89 out of 100,000 people in the two years.
What do you do if the child is suspected of being harmed?
If you would like to talk to the local social services or call the NSPCC's child support line 0808800 5,000.
A police raid in Kaduna, rescue of 300 children.
Kaduna-Kaduna State Police forced yesterday to search the Imam Ahmed Bunma School in Igabi, arrested seven teachers, and rescued about 300 children.
Police say children were inhumanized, but the school denied this claim.
The residents who call themselves chefs, school pastors, say, "The children are all coming into school with the consent of their parents, so their claims are not true."
"Before they entered the child, the parents signed a consent form.
The parents were bringing meals to their children every day, so they know what they are doing in their environment.
How surprised they were when the police came and evacuated their children, took away all the food that their parents had brought them, and shut down the school!
This is unfair when there are parents who can testify whether they have left their children in such a terrible environment as the police say."
He adds that the former head of police department, Abu Dullerman, had once visited to see what the children were in, but he never complained.
And the kids are just studying the Koran, and that's all.
However, the police's chief of public relations, Yakhb Sabo, says that the children will be reunited with their parents after they have been handed over to the state government:
"In the name of gaining knowledge of the Koran, they were in an inhuman environment.
There were scars on the backs of many children.
So we're looking into the school to find out who owns the facility."
A foreign agent who can't handle China's development.
The initiative (BRI), Guangdong-Kong-Macao-Grao Bay Area (GBA), and the city with its new role as a testing district, have become the most foreign minds in the country.
The South Media Group interviewed seven foreigners from the age of 10 to 70 in Canton.
Born during the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, Singapore, he said he wanted to dream of becoming a scientist in Guangdong.
Russian student Nikita Nikundov at the University of MedU-BIT says that Russians and Chinese students can learn together in BRI.
We can work together to create new ideas and businesses.
Rachel Romeswindel, from the United States, started her career as a beauty blogger in the city of Toyo, but now there are over a million fans inbilly and Weibo.
Rachel said that Chinese traditions, culture and technology will continue to be distributed through her videos:
The head of the National Center for Montessori AMI in Guangzhou, JJB, and Reticia de Lasz, from France, say that child education is like a button on a jacket:
So, if you have the wrong button over here, you're going to have the wrong place.
Henry Shao, a Chinese-American, finds many benefits in his company in the center of GBA, including access to new policies, government policies, capital, and especially good brains.
Sean Choy, a Korean and a South Korean producer of Nanta Shaw, said that Guangdong is world famous and happy to be able to spread Nata Show in Guangong province:
Stephen Moller, the technical quality director of the Pearl River Piano, thinks how well he can finish a simple job is a good decision.
Moller is amazed at how many good young Chinese people learn to work hard to make good products and always improve their minds.
Gender removal of the Hondu, state's petition for sexual minorities.
On the 28th day, the Miesan Board of Education decided to remove the gender and gender profile of the state's high-ranking application as a concern for the sexual minority, such as transsexuals, whose mind and body do not match.
The province's Ministry of Education has taken an eight-year entrance exam with a gender selection formula and unsubstantiated approval, but it's going to take the item out of its own from every 20 years.
So, we're going to use a lot of research to do that.
I'm going to use a description of the gender that was selected to allow students to fill freely according to the content of the survey.
According to the councils, the gender section of the government's petition and Fukuoka Prefectures has been missing for nine years, and so has the removal of Japan and Japan.

In the Central Coast, a rape victim in a disguise, a court order against a victim.
In May 2017, a man wearing a dark-colored gryly suit grabbed a 12-year-old girl behind her back into the bush while attending a school in the Central Coast of the state.
After that, the man tied the girl to a tree and sexually assaulted her.
A search warrant was issued immediately after the arrest, and police seized a number of items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, the man was convicted of seven charges, including three charges of this assault, as well as another 11-year-old grouping, sexual abuse.
When a 12-year-old victim turned around on the way, he suddenly saw a man come out of the bush armed with a big tree branch and a knife.
When she asked him to stop, stop, stop.
Men don't yell at girls.
He said, "If you scream, you'll have to get hurt."
He held a blade in his right hand, tied her hands with a cable tie, and then tied her hands to a tree, and abused her for nearly an hour.
A man loosened the cable, and the girl rushed to school screaming madly.
He arrived at work about 9:30 a.m., texted and called several times from his colleagues.
The man stood up with his garments of mud, grass, and trees, and he was violent on the road, and pursued his driver to the bush, and claimed that he had turned him by the earth.
The man's trial will continue on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development is based on public interest
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, and investors on Friday that without the ethical assessment of public interest, artificial intelligence and other digital development would be likely to increase social injustice.
The pope spoke at the Vatican conference of government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethical scholars.
A few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited to this conference, entitled "The Public Interest of the Digital Age".
The three-day conference has also given the Vatican the latest evidence of the willingness to discuss the future and the dangers of artificial intelligence.
The conference discussed the future of war technology and increased mechanical work, while also examining cases of shootings in New Zealand Christchurch and the response of social media companies during the brutal video spill.
In his speech at the conference, Pope John Paul II praised the development of technological progress, citing how machines freed workers from danger and simple labor during the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.
But he warned that if we rely too much on robotics for profit, it could rob us of the dignity of our labor.
"If the advances in technology were to cause more and more inequality, it would not be true progress."
If the so-called human technological advances were to turn against public interest, unfortunately, they would turn against certain types of savagery based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, they want to take advantage of the expertise of those present at the conference to present potential advisers to the Catholic Church in the high-tech field.
Nagano Surprises, you're going to be out of line at the GAA!
Master, thank you.
Hiroshima Nagano, 34th in the middle of the 27th, first in the 4th and left wing.
At the first second base of his death, he was on the verge of retirement for this season, by Earth Wind and Fire, "Septembel."
The result was a bit of a rinery, but a sensitive fan of Nagano's clever surprise said, "Oh, my God!"

Martin Udegaard, Leal Madrid's loaner, and a fan of the Atheist.
Martin Udegaard showed some amazing antsistes for the preeminence of Michael Oyarsabal.
Real Madrid won Ossana in 2-0, has now renewed his record of failure in the domestic season, and has stepped on the top of La Liga's list.
But this season, despite not losing the game in La Liga, there is a violent open war and an open disagreement with Wales star Garres Vale, who is under tremendous pressure.
When Leal Madrid was humiliated by Paris Saint-German at the Chanpies League, the pressure seems to have reached its limit.
But there are players who seem to have real talent and who don't belong to the director's current plan.
Vinisius Junior is one of the stars in the future such as Real Madrid, currently playing on a team.
However, another young Norwegian man, Martin Odegoll, who has been relocated to Real Sociedda, is also being hailed as a brilliant Aistist in La Rega.
Martin Udegall played with Leal Sosieda versus Alabes, and his surprise at the advance of Michael O’Yarzabal, Leal Sosieda, won on a base of 3 to 0.
Martin Udegaard, who received a ball from the right, sent an exquisite path through the inside of two other players to the Oyal Saval, and decided to take this exact swing and reach the goal.
Willian José's second goal and the third Penalt in the brilliant Oyalsabal, made sure that the Imanor team won a mighty victory just before the end of five minutes.
Martin Udegaard joined Leal Madrid at 16 in 2015, but he struggled to achieve the best of his reputation.
This Norwegian youth, now 20 years old, is finally taking his seat.
The name of Sharad Powerl has come as a surprise to the cooperative bank fraud in Anna Hazale, Mahalashtra.
Anna Hazale said, "When I heard from this case, the name of Sharad Powerle was not on the list."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the head of the National Congressional Party of Sharad Powerl in the tens of millions of lire-related Maharashtra’s joint bank fraud.
In connection with the case, the ED filed a financial laundering suit against the deputy minister of the state of Mahalashtra, who was the nephew of Sharad Powerl and his nephew Azit Powerl.
Based on the money-consumption law, a report from the government similar to that of the police's first report has been registered by the central authorities.
The case is based on the first report of Mumbai police where former presidents of the bank, Ajit Powerl and 70 former union bank officials were accused.
When I heard from this case, the name of Sharad Powerle was nowhere to be found.
She said on Thursday, “they only know how the name of Sharad came to light.”
Anna Hazale, a critic of Sharad Powerl, has expressed hope that if the government does a detailed investigation of the fraud case, they will find out the truth.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of a number of anti-corruption efforts, said that the government will know how his name came to light in the incident.
Sharad Powerl denied all injustice and questioned the timing of the court registration just weeks before the Maharashtra state elections on October 21.
The former Confederate Minister has clearly assured the Indian People's Party that he will not bow before the "king" of Delhi.

A Responsibilities Responsibilities System 4 (Auto Message Web) - Yahoo! News
I don't know, I can't believe I'm going to be able to buy you a peace of mind.
A traffic accident caused by a driver's mistake.
So, we're going to talk about some of the things that we're going to talk about in this video.
So, if you're in a state of panic, especially when you're in a state of panic, and you're on a brake pedal, you're standing on the stick.
There's a new car with safety support features that cover this kind of driving error.
It's an emergency prevention and prevention system developed and sold by such Afta parts manufacturers.
So let's see if we can do that.
The accelerator and the brake pedals are narrower at the same time.
"E-ACCEL ALARM" (EACEL Alarm)
The idea is to avoid the pedal's misstep with the alarm.
It's a very powerful mechanism. It's a very powerful mechanism.
The idea is to make the accelerator respond to sound and bring back the accelerator, and to prevent rapid acceleration by quickly detecting a mistake.
It's hard to see the change in engine sounds due to the accelerator's misstep, and it's effective for older drivers who are deaf.
The costume is inserted into the OBDII connector, and the body is taped on two-sided tape.
It's very easy to set up and make money.
The World Wings launched the launch in mid September, and watch for the "Axel Brake Error Prevention System."
We're not just going forward, we're going back.
In the advance and retreat from the stop (and less than 10km/h), the accelerator detects speed signals and brake signals on the side of the vehicle when it hits the ground.
The first step is to control the suddenness of the vehicle when it accidentally stepped on an accelerator, but not conveying a signal from the accelerator.
In fact, it's not just a matter of time, but it's also a time of retreat.
So, we're going to do a little bit of analysis here.
The body price is $37,000.

"I can't get away with five people," he says, "and I'm going to spend as much time at home as I can in case of a disaster, with food and a simple toilet.
He called for a change in the needs of family structure and housing conditions.
"The first day, the school had a closed text, the nursery had no network, no email system, and we wish there was a collective mail transmission system."
There was a request for a system that could be shared in real time on a flooded road.
"Previously, the weather has changed, and we're not going to make it through "the last time," and we're trying to save our connection to small carpenters and people and prepare for disaster."
Tanaka said, "The opinions given will also be passed on to the administration as a group."
I'm going to talk to the police department about the relationship between Mr. bory Johnson and the female businesswoman Jennifer Alici.
Police Directorate (IOPC) will now consider whether Prime Minister Johnson should be investigated as a violation of the law against scandals in the mayor of London.
In an announcement by the Great London Office (GLA), the H.L.I.S.A. said that the H.G.A.'s director had recorded "the matter of" his actions on suspicions that he had been treated by friendship with the Prime Minister.
"The "actions" exist if there is information that could have been a crime," says GLA.
This is not at all proof.
The IOPC will consider whether this should be investigated.
This issue was entrusted to the IOPC, which is an agency that corresponds to accusations issued by the British and Wales police.
The problem was entrusted to the police director because Johnson then had a position comparable to that of the police commissioner.
Mr. Johnson denies the injustice associated with his friendship.
Prior to this, Mr. Johnson said he was going to obey the order of the London Parliament to provide more information on his relationship to him.
The statement was received by the Sunday Times, which reported that Mr. Acuri, an American who had migrated to London seven years ago, was given 126,000 pounds of public funds in London’s Mayor’s time and that Johnson and Johnson had been treated to three foreign trading emissaries.
The government has since frozen 100,000 pounds of subsidy to the hacker house, a company that is being investigated.
The company will be asked embarrassing questions about the research process that took place before subsidy was paid.
In the United States, there is a company called the U.K. Department of Digital Affairs.
However, according to many reports, the number was forwarded to the California office where Arcili (34) is currently located.
The friendship between the Prime Minister and the businesswoman was "an open secret amongst the staff."
The movement to send the Prime Minister to police control has provoked the wrath of the Prime Minister's palace.
The government's high-ranking authorities say it's "the attack based on political motivations" and the night before the conservative party was "too much of a party party."
"No evidence has been presented on any of the charges, and the Prime Minister has not been given a chance to speak to the director's office on Friday night."
The people and the press will see the political madness behind their backs.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper said that Mr. Johnson's friendship with a California businessman, supported by the Tourism and Community Development Division in London, was a "public secret" between employees.
Despite the fact that some at the time thought it “untrustworthy” to him, former London and & P partners were privileged to accompany him to a trade conference outside the country led by Mr. Johnson during the mayor's time:
A fund of security for ordinary people to use to form property!
Today of the 20th anniversary of the new fund.
I heard the vision of the future by President Xiao Xiao, president of the Constitution.
- "Big Fund" celebrated the 20th anniversary of the setup this August.
I've been looking back over the last 20 years, and I've been feeling what I've been feeling right now?
And that's what we're going to talk about today.
I want to thank everyone involved, not just the power of the centipede.
It's a fun idea.
This spirit has remained in my mind for 20 years.
We work together in our daily affairs with the hope that if the public were to be relieved of money, the world would light up from the foundations.
In the long run, you'll have to work with the benefiters to get your grades.
And that's what we're talking about.
I feel that you understand the message we've been talking about all day about, "This is why we support the companies that are needed in the world."
And I think that's why it became a 20-year long fund, and it's because it's a direct sales system that can be delivered directly to many people.
So, we're going to talk a little bit more about this in the next video.
In general, it's a black box of information about what you're buying, just by telling the results.
And I think that's why we're going to do this.
Mac Miller's death, third drug arrest, is the key.
Los Angeles (AP) - A third man was arrested for a drug crime associated with the death of rapper Mack Miller in an overdose last year.
According to the court records, Stephen Walter was charged with selling a fake drug of oxycodone, which was mixed by Fentanil before he accidentally swallowed cocaine, alcohol, and Fentanil before he died last September.
Walter is charged with providing drugs to another man selling drugs to Mr. Miller.
According to the court records released on Tuesday, Petit was taking drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Rivis was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havas City, Arizona, for delivering drugs to Petit as Walter's "porter."
None of them are directly charged with Miller's death, and there are still arguments about each case.
Walter, currently in custody, has already been sentenced to five months in prison for his violation of the law because he was under probation for a drug incident in 2005.
The prosecutors in charge of the case that was first reported on Thursday by the Celeb site TMZ have requested that Walter remain in custody until the trial begins because it is very likely that he will escape from the country.
I didn't get any answers right away to my lawyer's phone call.
Petit is accused by the federal court on September 4th, but his lawyer refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and they have won fans in the hip hop world.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name was Malcolm James McCormick, and two years of association with the singer Arina Grande was broken up in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a loveful video of the mirror on her Instagram and released a song about the mirror, called "Sunky Nest."
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in connection with recent Opioid abuse.
The rock band 3 dors-down guitarist Matthew Roberts has also died of an overdose of drugs in 2016, and in his body, Fentanil and hydrocodone have been found.
In this post, the spelling of Walter's name was corrected by Stephen, not Stephen.
More than 30 Nigerian 9-year-olds and mobile games.
This nine-year-old is creating hide-and-seek games using a free programming app called Scratch 2.
Using stratch 2 can create games, animations, stories, and so on on and off.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
Today's game is a game programmed for bats to hide.
The player gets a point when he grabs a bat that comes out of a hiding place.
I learned how to make games in short-term focus classes.
Basil told CNN that he's spending his time playing games when he's bored.
In March, her father applied for a five-day course of intensive attention for children aged 5 to 15.
This course, conducted by Code Fest International, was introduced to give children like Basil access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okula Sinya, Basil grew up playing a lot of mobile games.
"Bazy always took her cell phone and played a game, so I bought her a tablet at four.
The candy crash and the Temple run did a lot of it, and his father told CNN.
But after being scolded for playing all the time, Basil’s interest in playing games grew when he was seven.
"One day, I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with games that I got a little angry," said my father.
I was so frustrated, I said, "I'm always playing games, but why don't you play games yourself so that others can play?"
I was angry when I said that, and I didn't think Basil really cared."
Since then, Basil has been eager to learn how to make his own game and asked her parents to buy her a laptop and to register for her first lesson in game making.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, names his game as it is.
One of the games, Mosquito Mash, is available in Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, young people like Basil are taking the lead.
Recently, two 12-year-olds in Nigeria were rewarded with a robot that uses program code to clean up their house.
In May 2019, at the Robo Fest competition, the women's high school team, Akrobot, who programmed a box of robots, won.
An increase in African investment in Google and a Microsoft giant technology company has made Basil and his peers become future programming stars.
Former President of the Republic of North Carolina, you're cleared for perjury in a bribe investigation.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is expected that former Republican President North Carolina has falsely admitted to a federal agent who conducted a corruption investigation involving major political donors.
In the Federal Court's case list, Robin Hayes is going to confess next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of a plea deal and signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes knew he was making false statements to FBI agents in a corruption investigation in 2018.
The actual judicial deal documents are sealed, and the documents that are based on the facts do not specify which crimes Hayes will admit.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
The prosecution filed a charge involving former Congressman Hayes in his plan to contribute to the state's insurance director's campaign in return for special treatment.
Greg Lindberg's executive and two co-owners have been charged with attempted bribes to the Secretary of Insurance Mike Kossey.
Lindberg is the founder of insurance and investment companies, who have donated more than $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindberg supported the Republican ideals and politicians, but he also donated money to the Democrats.
I asked Lindberg's lawyer for an email on Friday, but they didn't answer.
On Friday, Hayz's defense attorney, Carnes Davis, requested additional comments from an email.
On Friday, a court document says that Hayes lied to the FBI agent in August 2018, when he said he had never had a conversation with Kosy about the state insurance department staff.
But according to the fact-based documents, Hayes was actually talking about the state insurance director and the insurance agency's motion request.
The prosecutor also said that he helped Lindberg's request to meet with Cochsey and that he and the director had a direct deal with him about bribes.
In April, the prosecutions claimed that Lindberg was going to put up $2 million into a campaign to re-elect Kosy in 2020, seeking special treatment for his insurance services.
According to the prosecution, the conspiracy involved a replacement request from the authorities who were examining Lindbergh's company.
Republican Kosy helped in the case by reporting charges of attempted bribes to federal agents.
There's no doubt about Corsey.
In a conversation, including Lindbergh and Kosy, the prosecution stated that Lindbergh's partner ordered Hayes to transfer a quarter of a million dollars to Kosy's re-election campaign.
According to the prosecution, Hayes initially objected that he would draw attention if he made such a high amount of money, but he broke in his conversation.
The prosecution says Hayes will do whatever you want.
Okay, I'll do it.
I asked the D.A.'s press officer for more information on the plea deal in an e-mail, but they didn't respond.
We're going to do a lot of work on Facebook, try to improve the well-being of users.
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's happiness, some users will soon be less likely to see the number of people who like other people's posts!
This change following the beginning of the similar Instagram test in Australia in July.
The new Facebook attempt will be launched on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australian policy manager Mia Garrick said the change was based on mental health feedback from experts who see the number of people who are happy, happy, and happy as a result of social comparisons:
Garrick said that he had a very positive feedback from the many bullying groups and mental health organizations that are working together.
It's not just the number of actions that users like, like, or respond to, but the quality of interaction and content.
Garrick said he expected users to feel more secure on this platform than they would feel competitive:
Garrick assured the businesspeople on Facebook that they will receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed:
It’s a long time to do the same test in countries such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, and Ireland.
Instagram, under Facebook umbrella, has not announced when the test will end or remain changed.
"I had positive feedback on the experience at Instagram at first, but now it’s a phase of listening to feedback and learning," Garrick said.
Garrick, who is in the world's training country of Australia, pointed out that Australia is a highly aggressive "technic" user:
He thought Australia was a wonderful country with good feedback on whether this was a valuable experience or not.
Rugby W. "Miracle!"
"I've got tears in my eyes"
In Osaka, Japan's huge stars were praising us.
The company who watched the outdoor monitor in the Osaka Minami moat.
I thought I was going to be separated because I lost the first half, but I was surprised to be turned upside down.
Kijima Shibuki-san is a social rugby experienced.
I was so happy that I could fight against the world's top level, and I was so happy to be able to fight against the world's top level.
Tony Lin (50), a New Zealander and wife who are coming to watch the WW (New Zealanders) wear Japanese uniforms in a pub in Osaka.
"It was a tough fight, but Japan was very good at it.
And he said, "Well, it's not a big surprise, because it's a great level up compared to eight years ago.
I'm going to fix my broken bag, and I'm going to fix myself.
One day, I took my mother's favorite bag, and it stopped rolling.
If your favorite bag is broken, I'd like to fix it and continue to use it.
It's like, "Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
When I was about to give up, I thought, "I might not be selling it anymore."
My mother's broken bag, she's the ultimate puccipla.
So, if you ask the store to fix it, it's going to cost you a lot more than the body price.
My mother said, unfortunately, I didn't want to give up.
So let's go back to the last video.
But if there's any ring-like metal, it's all silver-coloured.
So let's see.
I went to Kandu on the wrong foot and finally found it!
I was inspired when I discovered it in the Handicraft section.
Let's do another one.
So, it's actually a little bit of a piece of material that we're going to use for key holders and charm DY.
So let's say I have a bag handle and I have a bag handle.
The ring is small, but if you line it up with the one-sided bagknife...!
This opened the way to the bag repair.
So let's do that.
Excitement!
The opening of the ring is designed to break inward, and it's hard to pull outward.
I put it in my bag right away.
♪ The color of the gold is good for gold, but the ring size is so small that it's too tight... ♪
So let's do that.
So, we've got a lot of hardware, but we've got a lot of light.
So, we're not going to do that. So, we're going to do this in a different way.
The National Railway Express is a temporary train to Hiroshima, the bear book, and the newspaper Atts, which says, "The 0-hour journey."
On the 28th day of the emergency train, the National Iron Age Express, awaiting departure at JR Hiroshima Station.
The people who enjoy traveling on a temporary train with the image of the nation's Emirates.
A temporary train, depicting the Emergence of the Iron Age, ran on 28 days, between Hiroshima and Omani.
About 240 railway fans boarded a two-year-old blue passenger car from Hiroshima Station in the morning and set off on a journey of about "0 hours" to Bekumi Station.
It's been 950.80 years, a night train with Bearmoto and Tokyo.
It was a two-day round trip, a tour sponsored by Japan as part of the JR and other tourism initiative.
The train runs on the mountain line, the train line, the train line, and the Kagoshima line.

My brother's been detained for the honor of killing Kandir Baloch, a social media star in Pakistan.
Kandir Baloch, famous for her social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.
On Friday, Kandir Baloch’s brother, a popular Pakistani social media user, was convicted of the murder of his sister, and was sentenced to life in prison for the most prominent "primitive murder" in Pakistan, the head of the family.
The famous Baroch was strangled in July 2016 in Pakistan, where women’s contempt for women is very strong.
My brother Muhand Washim was arrested.
In a press conference a few days later, he said, "Of course, she killed her sister, and that she was not sorry for what she did."
His lawyer, Saldar Meadow, told AFP that the court of Multan, the eastern city, had been awaiting a sentence that found her guilty and sentenced her to life in prison.
"Inshaler will be acquitted in the Supreme Court," said the lawyer.
Earlier, Mr. Baloch's mother, Anwar Mei, told AFP that she wanted her son to be acquitted:
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
The murder of Mr. Baloch has become a world-wide news story, and voices have been reiterated calling for action against the spread of the so-called "glory killings" of women who have been killed.
In Mr. Barrow's case, women have been burned, shot, stabbed, or strangled by crimes that have humiliated their families in praise of their sexuality.
Killing is usually done by close relatives.
Later, with the Pakistani Kisas and the Dieya law, the perpetrator can ask forgiveness from the relatives of the victims.
Three months after Mr. Baloch's murder, the parliament passed a new law requiring life imprisonment for honor killings.
But if murder is committed in honor, it is left to the judge's discretion, and the murderer can logically claim another motive, and may be pardoned.
In Mr. Baloch's case, his parents initially insisted that he not be pardoned.
But my grieving parents, thinking they would lose him, changed their minds and asked for forgiveness for him.
In response to international hatred for killings, the Pakistani government took an unprecedented step to declare itself a successor to both parents and the country, but the lawsuit continued.
Baloch's famous behavior includes offering a strip show to the Pakistani cricket team and wearing a red dress with a wide-opened heart on Valentine's Day.
Many, including young people, recognized that expressing themselves as something like Kim Kardashian was considered a bold political activity that improves women's status.
The roots of the "glory" murder are ethnic social norms that are still widespread throughout South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior.
A cold sheet, a disaster area, and 1600 earthquake, main and storage items.
It's a cold seat box installed at the "Next Evacuation Ground" in the Tokyo District of Japan.
The Yamaguchi newspaper presents to the four municipalities affected by the June earthquake off the coast of Tokyo, Japan, 1,600 Aluminum shelters and 5 open storage boxes to store them.
We're going to need you to place us in the coastal districts for the tsunami.
The ceremony will be held next month at the first shelter in Ratket District.
In response to the earthquake damage in the city of Nagasaki, which is an alliance, the quake will provide ice sheets for the government of the region nearest to the quake's source.
The gift was sent to the local government of Ishikawa, Japan, where it is donated to each of the local communities.
In the earthquake off the coast of Honshu, many of the residents of the coast of Japan were evacuated with fear of the tsunami.
In the city of Kobe, they fled to their first shelter, such as the high ground in their communities.
There were no massive tsunamis, most evacuees did not move to a second shelter where they could stay, but many of the first shelters were heard of the cold because of the outdoors.
It was one of the challenges to prepare for similar disasters, such as severe cold weather and weather.
Seats that can cover their entire lives during evacuations.
It's got a heat shielding mechanism in the hot sun.
It's about three feet by two feet, and when you fold it, it's about three inches by two feet.
Using the four layers of gold, silver, and tail, you can cover your body with cold weather and heat shielding.
We have a metal box to store the sheets in the first shelter that's outside.

A painting of the "Choose Arts" in front of a store in the town store.
On the 27th day of the show, the Japan Institute of Art, the Association of Cultural Arts, the Association for the Arts of the Universal, the Association for Social Services, and the Association for the Art of the Art of the Disabilities, opened up in the town of Okayama on the street of the town of Nakayama on the 27th day.

We've got 50 paintings, seven shapes, five photos, from all within the province.
The paintings are in front of each store, the designs are in the open underground town art space, and the photographs are lined with Asano cameras.
Parts of each work are printed on banners and displayed above the top of the arcades in the shops.
The paintings are bold, colorful, delicate, and impressive.
Images of four seasons, such as red leaves and snowwaters, are also distinctive.
The president of the Association for the Intellectual and Intellectual Health and Welfare of Japan says that it is the way the work blends into the city, and it is the way it touches nature and art, and I hope that many citizens will enjoy it.
The exhibition was inspired to evaluate works of non-art professionals as "alarm burrit" since the end of the 20th century.
This time it will be the same time as the 27th day's program to sponsor the International Art Festival, which begins in the fall of the 28th and 28th.

The Association for Sports in Okinawa and the Association for Sports in Japan has concluded a partnership to support the development of sports in Okinawa on the 25th.
In addition to actively cooperating in the projects that the two groups conduct, such as training training for various contests, there is also an interregulation of health care and prevention of children from remote islands, such as when they travel abroad.
When both groups conduct sports courses, they go through private trainers, instructors, and share information.
When a team of outings travel to a convention outside the island, they also work on solving problems such as the cost of travel and the difficulty of trainers.
In particular, they work with the ASA's Sports Center, which associates with the ASA at local conventions, such as district conventions, to help prevent the decline in performances of the players due to the fatigue of sailing and sleeping.
Also, during the convention at Nakatashima, Okinawa, the local ossuary and hospital personnel are co-operating to support the athletes from outside the island.
On the 25th, there was a ceremony in the famous town of Elabu.
After that, the two groups organized a study course by Takahiro Takao Takahiro on the day of the Olympic trainer.
Local sports youth groups, group leaders and guardians have learned how to use them properly and avoid them.
President Tokita (52) said that "the idea of losing Handy on the sport environment is common to each other, and there are a lot of things that we can do to help, if we can make this deal open up a circle of partnership with other islands of Miho."
Former Director Tokita (43) said it was very encouraging to have a partnership with a well-known organization like ASA, if you would like to absorb some of the good things for the sports environment of the isolated children.
This is a time when traditional common sense is broken.
It's the kind of thing that's attractive about a man who's able to renew his identity.
In fact, as a brain scientist, I've been thinking twice about love.
"The Brain Scientific Romance" by a great deal of knowledge and new insights.
Then I'll send you a picture.
In the previous section, the uninhibited tree clings to the traditional "fantasy of man" and is overreached by its pattern learning!
I've been talking about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool, attractive guy.
I'm not going to be able to survive when I'm caught.
In the previous video, we talked about how we always evolved to be cool, so we need to look at all kinds of works and behaviors, and learn patterns every day.
So, we're going to learn a pattern, and we're going to learn a pattern, and we're going to do this in a way that's better for the brain to organize action so that it can live.
Whether I'm attractive or not, I still think I'm evolving every day.
That's why it's easier to live.
I've been teaching in Hitoki and Tokyo University, so I've talked to many young people, and I've learned a lot about how to interact with them.
But if you're in a position to be a university professor, and you're stuck with an old pattern like, "A university teacher is more dignified," it might be a little hard.
I don't insist on it. I enjoy it every day.
But if you say, "This is what we should do," you're not going to survive.
I don't want to change, but I want to change.
That's what I've told you in my recent interview book, "I'm living in a world that's terrible."
It's about the weight and the authority, and it's about the person that comes out of it.

And that's what we're going to do in the next video.
I mean, it's not easy when you're obsessed with "sympathy."
I'm going to do it in a different color, but I'm going to do it in a different color.
It's hard to say what this is.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
On Friday, the United Nations announced that over the past four months, the number of refugees from the northwest of Nigeria has doubled to about 40,000.
According to the United Nations refugee organization, this chaos will create a new humanitarian crisis, and each agency will need to work together to raise $3.5 million by the end of this year.
The UNHCR’s news correspondent Bbarl Balok said that Bokoharm, an Islamic extremist organization that has been in opposition in northern Nigeria for 10 years, had nothing to do with the recent armed attacks:
Rather, the violent increase in Sokot, Zamfara, and Katina in Nigeria over the past ten months was due to an organized armed group.
“It’s a good sign of the horrors of the illegal and unstable situation,” Balok told the press on Friday.
The press said that kidnappings, tortures, thefts, murders and sexual violence are frequent, and that the attackers are also responsible for the destruction of homes and thefts.
The military and police are also being sent to fight against the local criminal organization.
But the army is tired of fighting Bokohalam and the West African branch, which split up from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees do not come under the name of the group," he says.
It's a terrible experience.
Most of the refugees cross to the neighboring country of Niger.
In a statement, UNHCR announced that the situation in Sokot, especially in the state of Sokot, is getting worse, and that in the next few months, more refugees will be coming to Niger.
A new trial date is established for a man who murdered two women and children.
The court date for Guatemalan male men who are said to have killed women and two children in Iowa has been established.
According to the Pork County Court Record, Marvin Escobar Orellana (31) was charged with a murder of a first degree in three cases committed under the name of Marvin Esquivel Lopez, who was first known by the authorities.
He claims he's innocent.
According to the police, on July 16, he shot her daughter (11) and her son (5) at the house in Demoin.
The court records further time for both lawyers to prepare for a new trial date on the 27th of the month.
According to U.S. immigration Bureau officials, Escobar Orellana was illegally staying in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal entry to the US in 2010.
Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) has started advertising for the header by "Previd.js" on "Logicad for Pubishers" (LFP).
The LFP is a service to buy and run its own advertising frame, which is what the advertisers want.
The book service provides an effective advertising framework via DSP's "Logicad" in collaboration with media.
In this video, we're going to talk about headervising, which is a fair bid on multiple vendors, which enables the media that run the media to deliver the single-private ads.
There is a high transparency for media companies, and the introductions are leading to major media issues as a solution that is likely to improve profits.
So far, "Loginado" has provided S.S.P.S.P.s on advertising frames.
In recent years, the LFP, which is direct to buy advertising frames according to the media's wishes, has been launched since December, in response to a request from the ad-Lord to send them to a certain frame of reference that is closely related to each commercial or brand image.
This time, we're going to expand the introduction of the LFP by responding to header-vising.
As a benefit for the advertisers, LFP's header-by-bulling enables them to participate directly in bids on the header-by-hand advertising frame, hoping to improve the distribution of the ads.
The limited media outlets also provide advertising frames along individual commercial materials and brand images to prevent brand-value losses.
A benefit for media companies is that they can work together to meet the media's desire by combining and managing the code of each Bidder called "Wrapper" which the LFP is working on.
A small company's production, Jerome's, sold on a foreign-commercial site, Att es
The Japanese Trade Organization, through its overseas Internet service website, is working to support the expansion of small businesses.
It's an attempt to set up a special Japanese corner on an overseas site, to bring together products from different parts of the country, and sell them directly to foreign consumers.
The company's application is now reaching a record of over 1,000 companies in China and Southeast Asia.
The "JAPAN MALL project" began last year.
The main focus is small companies that don't have commercial access to overseas, and they encourage the growth of cosmetics, drinks, processed products, and other things around the world.
It can be sold on 24 major sites, such as the West and the Middle East and Asia, which are all connected with Geo.

In October 2017, according to the General Ministry, the male aide became emotional when it directed several students in the lab, and made strong emotional stress, such as verbal abuse and verbal abuse.
It's an educationalally well-adulted pawahara, and it's declared to have made the academic environment worse.
In September 18th, several students filed a survey.
In addition to interviews with students and assistants by engineering executives, from December of the same year, teachers on the US campus have conducted an investigation on the Committee on the Prevention of Harassment.
In response to the results from the committee, the President of Shigeruyama and the Directorate of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
After the survey, the prosthesis of men continued to reach the point of education, but the previous action was improved through interviews and he said he was saying "I'm sorry".
The president of Kakuyama's school expressed deep appreciation for the victims and others, saying that he will raise all the learning and work on preventing harassment and restoring trust.
In the university, there is also an internal investigation into the suspected sexual harassment of female students who are directed by a male teacher in engineering, and a policy to publish if they are disciplinary.
The insurgency of the cabinet, demand that Mr. Boris Johnson reduce the demand for leaving the EU and make a compromise with the EU.
As it has only been three weeks since the resolution of the EU summit, there is growing concern around the Prime Minister that the Prime Minister is running out of time to pull out a huge resignation.
Mr. borys Johnson is facing an insurgency in his cabinet demanding that he lower the demand to leave the EU and make a compromise with the EU.
A new customs system in place of the Irish border ceasefires, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative proposal to be "impotent".
The senior ministers hope that the EU leaders, led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel, will present a compromise of three years' time limit to this cornered conservative party leader:
The Sun spoke to three cabinet ministers who are ready to face the Prime Minister after the annual conservative convention in Manchester next week.
They're going to demand that the Prime Minister give up his "extinct" strategy to threaten the EU with an unconventional departure from the senior adviser Dominic Cummings, and that the EU accept an offer that will allow it to go on the limit.
One cabinet minister said that the ruling against the Supreme Court's closing session on Tuesday was "a warning" and that "now the compromise is the only way we can leave on the day of "0-3".
We will never win the numbers in the House of Representatives, they are against us.
The Prime Minister must take advantage of what is available from his steps.
It's not going to work even in the extreme, and the Kamingus project is clearly failing.
I can't fight in so many fields.
Another member of the cabinet promised to tell Mr. Johnson to carry out the agreement of former Prime Minister Terryza May.
The senior minister added, "I'm going to tell Borris to return Terisa's agreement to the House of Representatives if necessary.
There's a lot of people out there who want to end this.
If we don't postpone, Borice's over, and we're all done.
Sir John Major accused Borris of not taking negotiations seriously.
In a harsh speech, the former head of the conservative party said that the Prime Minister wants us to make an agreement with the EU.
But we haven't seen the Prime Minister sit at a meeting with the EU and make an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland struggling with a bull, testing eggs on a waitress, and arguing with the public on the main street, as if the elections were becoming real."
Yesterday, the Prime Minister's spokesman recognized the agreement as a long way ahead, and "no one should be mistaken: if he achieves his goal, the journey is still long."
However, the press also said that the Ben Bill, which forces a three-month re-reservation when leaving without agreement, "is a great help to our negotiations" in Brussels.
“It is true that the bill has prevented our negotiations, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to keep moving forward despite the bill’s being passed.”
Stephen Berkeley, European Union Minister, will return to Brussels today for further consultation with the EU Michel Barnie.
They discuss the documents on how the entire island of Ireland will function on food and livestock:
Lorraine Kelly: I'm sure you'll never make it on TV.
Lorraine Kelly was told by her TV bosss that she would never succeed as a host in her Glasgow accent.
Before he first appeared on TV, he said he was very nervous, and Kelly, 59 years old, recalls 35 years in the air industry:
"I'm only 25, and I'm very nervous," she says.
I was working as an investigator at the BBC Scotland Station, and my boss told me I would never succeed in your glassgo accent in the TV industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to see everyone on the TV-am team and to see the show being broadcast.
And I will never forget that morning when Diamonds and Mike Morris interviewed the legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe you were in the same room as a living legend.
I know where I want to be.
Kelly started working as a local newspaper reporter in East Kirblad, Scotland.
And then Kelly hosted a show on GMTV, on ITV Breckforst and Daybreak, and then started Lorraine, the show that bears her name.
In memory of the 35th anniversary, we will broadcast Kelly’s most memorable scenes and interviews.
He added that curiosity was the key to survival in the television industry, and that the host said, "We have to go to work."
I must be honest and honest.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do what I have to do.
Looking back on the shocking news, Kelly reported that the Dunblane shootings were "very painful."
"I didn't know that the day after the terrible murder of six of my students and teachers, we were killed and that we were live to broadcast the show from Dunblane, or that many of the families of injured children were watching.
I've been talking to her for hours, because she says she wants to meet me personally, and she's a mother's "pam" and her five-year-old daughter, Joanna, killed.
I don't take it all away on the show, I go to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I have been friends ever since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gerly McCann's daughter Madeleine went missing, saying it was "very hard," and saying, "I really respect their strength and courage."
They have to endure the painful and confusing Internet impact of not knowing what's going on with their beloved daughter.
I'm really sorry about your husband and your wife.
Lorraine's 35th show will be broadcast at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Chiwenga was afraid of being trapped in Zimbabwe.
According to government officials, Vice President Konstantino Chiwenga turned down his offer of office from the late former president Robert Mugabe in the midst of political upheaval because he feared it might be a trap for him to follow military action in November 2017.
While Mugabe and the Defense Forces continue to negotiate during the coup, Mugabe offered to give Chiwenga the office of president, reports The Zimbabwe Independent last week.
However, according to government officials on social media, Chiwenga's refusal was not due to anxiety but because she saw the intention of Mugabe to make known to world leaders and the African Union that the coup took her power.
On a series of Twitters from Jamwanda2, which officials confirm to be the president's cabinet official, Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years, is reported to be positive in giving over to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munangguwa, and there was intense negotiations in the case.
When Mugabe realized that he was losing his power, government officials said he had made contact with Chiwenga by the envoys.
According to government officials, the exchange between the military command center and the late and former president was made by three people.
The president's spokesman, George Charranva, Aaron Nepera and Fidelis Mkonori, the Roman Catholic bishop of the time, were involved in the negotiations.
Gideon Gono, director of the Bank of Zimbabwe Reserve, is one of Mugabe's soles, who has commissioned ZDF (ZDF) General Chiwenga to hand over his seat.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death rather than after his death, failed in an attempt to accuse the African Union of military action while seeking intervention from African leaders.
The offer to give up the office of president to the former CDF was not due to the choice of former President Mugabe.
"It was the throwaway action to save some of the late President's family by starting to get tired and spreading dangerously quickly," he writes.
The late president's political aim was, at least diplomatically, to change the tide.
If you want to destroy the Constitutional Order, remember that the African Union was supposed to be in conflict with the views of the coup, but the commanders had declared that they would not break its constitution and would not break it.
Therefore, President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, the military leader of his day, would be trapped and would break the claim of the commanders who claimed that he had not broken the constitution.
Therefore, President Mugabe wanted the African Union to call itself a coup, which has not yet decided whether to place the whole situation as a coup, and that the demands for military intervention were finally deemed valid.
That was the intention and calculation at the root of this offer.
The authorities say Mugabe moved when he realized that he would not be protected by the defense forces.
He was warned by the military that he would be executed like Gaddafi, saying he had to write a letter of resignation.
The military commanders told Mugabe that they would not point a gun at the citizens, even if they would break into a presidential house called Blueroof.
At that point, Mugabe wanted two things: to protect his own family and prove that he was deprived of power by the military.
The commanders and the commanders of the day read their intentions exactly.
The message of the President's desperate message was used by the government officials, saying that the message he received was a powerful metaphoric expression: "Is Tili Bemmacwapa Mcwapa (We belong to the military), we are not politicians, we are not in the middle of a political competition,"
The army told local military commanders, through the military forces that they were staying in Zimbabwe, that their aim was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "crimes" surrounding him, they said.
In the same way, Mugabe tried to call back Munanggwa, who was in short-term exile in South Africa to discuss coups and successors.
In addition to negotiating with the Army, Mugabe needed local support.
Not only was the economic and regional power there, but the South Africans, who refused to intervene, because Jacob Zuma was then president of the South African Development Community, made it clear that if the military had invaded the President’s home, they would have been sent to Harare immediately, as they had threatened to do in the background.
"Only, it was not supported by President Putin and African leaders, so it didn't happen," the source reported in the Independent newspaper.
In 32 countries, the United Nations has been able to ratify the treaty in favor of nuclear bans.
On the 26th day at the UN headquarters in New York, a conference was held for a world without nuclear weapons.
On this day, five new nations were able to ratify the anti-nuclear treaty, and the ratification became 32 different countries.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and territories.
The meetings and ratifications were held in line with the 26-day UN's International Day for the total destruction of nuclear weapons.
The Secretary General Guterres also spoke and expressed strong concern over recent developments against nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

China needs powerful leadership, or it needs to collapse.
China needs strong, unified leadership, or else the country will “fall”, according to the Chinese government in a policy document released on Friday, prior to the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China’s People’s Republic.
In a blank document, China’s State Department news agency said that the party’s leadership has been responsible for the success so far since the Communist Party took power 70 years ago.
China is huge, and the situation is complex, but there is hardly any governing issue.
Without a strong, unified leadership, China will turn to division and collapse, and it will be a disaster for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified, if necessary for national stability, dealing with problems in a tough way, like the '989 campaign in Beijing.'
On Tuesday, the powerful head of Shinichi Shinichi, the world's second largest economic nation, has taken power in the latter part of 2012.
He has also supervised a modernization program that threatens the area.
China is not going to export its own model of development, nor is it going to adopt any other model of development, and is simply looking for peace rather than power, says the policy document.
In Chinese people's genes, there are no invasions or world domination of other people.
In modern times, China has been bullied by a row of powers, and war and chaos have left a deep scar with its pain; and China will never inflict on others the pain she has experienced.
China has been blessed with a year when the country is in a state of instability in a severe trade war with the United States, and is facing difficult challenges, such as poor economic conditions and opposition to government movements in China Hong Kong.
China will never give up its core interests, and will not allow security and sovereignty to suffer, says the White House.
"The threat of a trade war and the rising taxes are not a solution to any problem."
China is a completed industrial system, a full industrial chain, a mature economic state with a broad market space and a momentum for strong economic development.
"I will never weaken in the trade war."
I am convinced that China has the power to face hardship, to change the crisis into a chance, and to create a new world.
He added that since China has no idea of fighting against the United States or wanting to replace it, the United States should take China’s development seriously.
The United States cannot control China, and even less likely to stop China’s development.
The United States would not remain strong if it were to suppress, suppress, and move the conflicts of the country out of the country.
It's not like I'm not going to be able to do it.
High school baseball famed for its 5th national victory in the spring and announced that on 28 days, Tetsunoru and Chief Kimko (42) were released on the same date.
From now on, he will be the director of the team, and the head of the board will make a quick decision.
Director Nakata, the local newspaper reported that on the 26th day, local newspapers used to swear against baseball players.
When the school heard about the situation between the two of them, the director of the school was able to see that he had caught the neck of the student, and he recognized part of the abuse.
In addition, after the results of a survey by 66 students, I again confirmed the case with them, and dismissed them on 28 days because they recognized it as a fact.

Melanie Chizom of the spice girls admitted that she has forbidden diets in her home because of her eating disorder, which includes eating nothing but fruits and vegetables for years.
The Spokane was diagnosed with depression and eating disorders as a result of not eating enough food for many years under the pressure of a global pop group.
Chizom said his experience was also affecting his daughter Scarlett's upbringing and revealed that "all dieting topics are forbidden in the home."
Mel says she's ten now and she's starting to care more about her appearance.
But my eating disorder has made me very careful when talking to my daughter.
It's a positive word, now it's a habit.
In the 1990s, when she became famous as a member of the spice girls, she said that her body was affected by a "bad" comment about herself on the media in front of a social network.
"I lost control of myself, removed certain foods, became obsessed with exercise, and became too thin."
I was sick, and I've been in it for almost a few years."
It's not just sex, it's marriage, it's marriage, it's marriage, it's marriage, it's marriage, it's marriage, it's marriage, it's marriage, it's marriage, it's marriage, it's marriage, it's marriage, it'
"In accordance with marriage" in a case that has been argued whether or not "consistency" can be obtained.
More than 20 countries recognize same-sex marriages, including Sapporo City, which has no legal effect in the country.
In light of this, the decision recognized the reality of the marriage between two women.
It was the first and most significant judicial decision to have legal protection for the same-sex couples.
A lawsuit is being filed in five courts, such as Sapporo, that does not allow same-sex marriage because of the rules of civil law or the institution.
We want to reverse the decision, to better understand the rights of the minority and to discuss how there is a system of laws that recognizes the diversity of families.
Women have lived together for about seven years, and they have obtained marriage certificates in the United States, but when they are broken by the outbreak of infidelity, the plaintiffs ask for compensation from their former partners.
The ruling, for example, recognized a "real marriage between a man and a woman."
It's a landmark decision that extends the recognition of marriage in the same sex, as well as the recognition of marriage by social insurance and other forms of marriage.
More importantly, it showed the interpretation of the 24th Article of the Constitution, which says that marriage is based only on mutual consent.
The two are: "It wasn't supposed to be same-sex marriage at the time, and it doesn't even matter whether or not it’s the same sex marriage."
While "the Constitution does not consider same-sex marriage" it is expected to be a sting on governments that do not know whether or not it is forbidden.
On the other hand, the problem remained that men and women are not allowed to marry in same-sex marriage, so they reduced the compensation by saying that the benefits of legal protection are different.
Is it not logical to recognize the same facts as men and women and then to judge their rights?
The public's awareness has also changed as a national domestic survey of married women shows that up to 70 percent of those who should have recognized same-sex marriage under the law.
As life-style diversity continues, the law will take away the rights of those who are bound to traditional family images.
In fact, marriage is not a legal "wife", so there is not a lot of restrictions on the tax system, nor does it have co-agency.
In the opinion of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review the family law from various perspectives, including the extension of the legal right of marriage, not to remain in same-sex marriage.
The trial of an athlete who was charged with assaulting multiple women, a jury trial.
A jury hearing is being held in the trial of a former baseball player at the University of Delaware who is accused of sexual assault on multiple women.
"On Friday, after zero days of testimony and argument, the jury began to debate the fate of Clay Conaway.
Two-year-old woman says she was sexually assaulted after driving Conaway home.
They met in three weeks on the dating site Bumble, and then Conaway sent a picture of her to a woman.
Konaway has been charged with sexual assault on six women during the period of 20 "3 through 20", but this woman is one of them.
The prosecution argued that women resisted Conaway's agreed embrace and that when he tried to rape a woman:
The defense pursues differences in women's conflicting claims and memories and suggests that women may have regretted having physical relations.

It's a huge problem. It's a huge problem.
Of Sydney's tourist resources that bring 219 million dollars to the Australian economy each year, Sydney Harbor is the largest source of income for opera houses, surfers key, Luna Park, and the famous Harbour Bridge.
But beneath the bridge lies an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia’s worst waterways in which about 15 Olympic pools are filled every year.
So, thanks to this frightening statistics, one of our largest tourist attractions is one of the dirtyest places.
According to a new video about Sydney, from the top to the bottom, around the most popular cities in Australia, there are smokeshells, plastic bags and plastic bottles, missing shoes and clothing, and even dead animals — all by means of road rain.
plastic is one of the biggest factors that chokes the water supply.
This video, which happened to be released on September 27th of a world tour by Dr. Catherine Daforn, vice president of the Sydney Harbor Research Program, says, "This is a paradox."
It looks beautiful, but it's one of the most altered and polluted mouths in our country's coastline.
According to CSIRO, it is estimated that 1560 kilograms of plastic per hour flows into the waterways, most of them pouring into Sydney Harbor via rain drains.
Dr. Daforn and Dr. Dafon.
Two-thirds of the pollution flows through the roads through the rain.
But it's like the tip of an iceberg, where 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is hidden below the surface of Sydney Harbor.
"I don't know what the truth is when I have to go to the bottom of the ocean," said Richard Nichols, the owner of the dive center, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year just himself and his team.
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples of what I'm going to do.
Overwhelming, but more than half of what we find is plastic bags.
The other half is plastic somewhere.
Sydney Harbor is beautiful, and no one can believe that all this plastic and garbage is flowing right below the surface of the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and directors of the Ocean Project, said that there is something that can be done by local residents and tourists to reduce the amount of plastic and garbage flowing into the water:
"Let's start with the source," he says.
We need to be more aware of what's going on in the drains, because we need to reduce the amount of plastic that we use, we need to be more aware of what's going on in the ocean.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe in comes from the ocean, and if we hurt the ocean, we kill ourselves.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a food source.
But we're going to fix Sydney Harbour and get back to its old form.
Killing the ocean means killing the human race.
This month, a new study on plastics and mental health was published this year, as part of a campaign that has been funded by the recycling company TOMRA as part of a widely known effort to reduce the impact of Australians on the environment and their drinking cans.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 feel hopeless about plastic waste, and 25 percent think it’s because they’re adults.
The study also found that, as parents, 93 percent of the 551 parents surveyed were concerned about the amount of plastic waste that flows into the oceans.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, and that led to eco-institution.
The Japanese government has been working hard to reduce smoking in Japan since October.
"The chimney of the former Tangshan Power Plant is beginning to be dismantled in the month of 0"
Kyushu announced on 26th that it would begin with "0."
It's expected to be finished by the end of March 202.
It's about 80 meters high.
It was removed in '99.
The chimney will be split from top to bottom.
The plan is to take nine months to break apart, to measure eight months.
The time to destroy the rest of the turbines and the boilers is not known.
A 60-year-old man who works near a restaurant said, "When you come back from a distance and see a chimney, it's like a symbol that makes you feel like you're back in Tangshan, and you don't want to see it anymore."
The old Tangshan plant started driving in 967, and the plane went off in 1989, and the plane two, two, three, was shut down in '20.
It's located at the tip of the port of Tangshan, about 25,000 square meters of land area.
The province and city want to take advantage of the site because it's nearby at yacht Harbor and JR West Tangshan Station.
The three who have added nine electric currents have signed a five-year agreement on the use of the site.
Local fish that sell goods, tail, eagle, fishnugs, and so on, triple.
Students who sell fishnugs and Thai rice rices at the Far Eagle High School in the city of Odookaoka.
A third grader in the Shikoku High School of Information Business in Odono, Miki Prefecture, Miki Prefecture, developed fishnach and Thai rice with locally fried fish.
I sold it at a cultural festival in the school on the 26th.
It's part of a large partnership of Sattite High in the third grade of the University of the East, which is working on the local industry, the water industry and the forest industry.
The products we have developed are fishnugs that are used to catch them in the bear's field, and fishnugs that are used to raise their tail eagles.
He's targeting young people.
The fishnuggets developed three kinds: tofu with tofu, and tofu with gas shrimps, special for the tail eagle.
A group of bears are working together in a processing plant in the town of Bakuno.
Thai rice is mixed with cytache, carrot.
It's the fish family that's working for the fish family.
The class started in June.
I've studied fish farms and fish farms and I've become more familiar with the fish industry.
In the workshop, we talked about consumer needs and tried our prototypes.
He also invented a nut with an azi, but he adopted a mtu because he had a particular smell for fish.
Yamaguchi-san (17) told me that even those who don't like fish can eat goods, that they would be happy to have more to eat.
They're negotiating with tourist facilities in the city so they can sell their goods.
I'm here now because I have a loving encouragement.
This time, Free Announcer Chant "CBC TV"!
The Master's advice to save me from my rotting.
I think that the actor Takahashi is more like a master than my father.
My father was an actor and I was an announcer.
It's not what I'm doing, but it's my father who taught me how to work, how to be good in the industry, how to be good in society, what to be important to me as a person.
When he got so hurt, he thought, "I didn't think it was a connection.
Then, in the second or third year of my company, when I was doing all the empty girls' jobs, when I didn't feel motivated to do what I wanted to do, and when my heart was starting to spoil, I asked everyone to do the work, so I asked them to do it, and they asked me to do it.
"I'm not going to tell you what I'm going to do." "I'm going to tell you."
I've never seen anyone read the news, but I've been talking to the news since I joined the TV station.
I was happy and confident that Matoko Deluxe was a good news reader, because I thought the personality and taste of the announcer was what would appear when I read the news.
When I read the news, it's the middle that makes me feel like it's important, it's the sense.
So, I'm going to show you a few examples of how to interpret and how to draw between lines and how to draw between lines.
In other words, the way we do it and how we deal with it on the show is because of our childhood experiences, and because of that, we owe it to him.
It's a 300-year-old history of dance/interpretation of education.
Workshops in the mirror.
A workshop on the 26th, looking into the role and effect of five instruments played at the dance.
The 20'9-year-old dance workshop, which was conducted at the University of San Diego on the 26th.
All the students participated, learning about the sound effects and use of musical instruments, as well as the 300-year history and the birth of a concert dance.
At the workshop, members of the OB, the Department of Sports at the State Arts College of Arts, explained the role of each instrument in the act of playing the whistles.
The director is from Miyashima, and the OB's Manjima is from Miyagi City, where he introduces you to the charm of dance.
In this workshop, we learned how five of the three elements of the dance are represented in the dance:
The three lines were explained to be part of the character's movement and emotional expression along with the song, and he was attracted to the performance of songs and three lines of melody.
In the latter part, the students actually touched the instruments and sensed the sound of them and found them attractive as instruments.
This is the first time in Miyagi that the idea is to have a close relationship with the classical music by means of musical instruments and to attract a lot of students to dance together.

I'm going to look back at the WRC World Larrys in the past!
(18)
It was not the last time that Japan was held on the North Sea road in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020?
The World Rally is one of four world championships controlled by the International Association of Autos (FEA) in line with FEC and FEA.
Since 1973, the world's highest historic and traditional peak in the world has become the larry championship, and the games have been held not only for closed highways, but also for the most severe auto championships in order to drive fast along various roads, such as gravel and snowways.
In the 2018 season, it became a big topic.
This time, we're sending a committee to invite Japan to the Japanese round.
The World Motor Sports Council, which is the highest resolution of the International Association of Autos, has decided to hold a WRC round of 2020.
On the occasion of the Japanese round of events, the governors of both Japan and Japan’s Shibuya Prefecture and the General Representative of ToyotoA GAZO Racing WRT, Mr.
● Governor of Miyagi province, Hidemura
"I really welcome you to the 20th anniversary of the FIA World Rary (WRC) World Cup, and I will do my best to be part of the world's most appealing competition as Japan's main motor sport center."
● Governor Shizuoka-san.
"I am very happy to announce that the FIA World Railian championship will be held here in the year 2020 of the Tokyo Olympic Paralympic Games, the first international motor sports competition in this province, and I am looking forward to seeing you around."
● TOOTOTA GAZO RACING WRT, D.
"I am so glad to be able to run Yalis WRC in Japan.
And I said, "Well, I'm going to give you some help, and I'm going to give you some help.
A lot of people have commented on the Japanese round of events, including the president of the Association for Motor Sports.
The WRC World larry round will be held between November 19 and 22, 2020.
The area is the public road to Tokyo, Japan, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo.
The main auditorium is announced to use "Love Earth Memorial Park," which was established at the site of the Japan International Fair in 2005.
And besides having a final meeting at the Tokyo Motors Show 2019, the Committee is scheduled to implement the "Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019" event on November 9, 2019.
The cancer treatment is the key to the Tasmanian devil.
Researchers who may be holding the key to cancer treatment by Tasmanian devil have made a breakthrough in the possibility of a major change in patients' treatment.
So, what we're going to do is we're going to look at how some of the cancer cells camouflage.
Researchers have discovered that the same process occurs between Tasmanian devil and humans.
It is hoped that this discovery will create a new way to treat cancer patients.
What do we have in common with Tasmanian devil?
It's a cancer cell that's invisible.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCall’s Cancer Center in Melbourne, discovered that if cancer does not respond to immunologic therapy, it can make a difference in the treatment for cancer.
It is possible that they have the key to the deadly facial tumor that threatens the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
So, in this study, we found that some of the cancer cells in humans and mammals, using a series of proteins called PRC2, don't react to the markers, so that the immune system won't attack the cancer.
This is a major challenge for the treatment of skin cancers called small - lung cancers, neurochloromas, and Merkel cells.
Professor Mark Dawson of Peter McCall's researcher told AAP that "the project is very important for patients who can show resistance to immune therapies that we may be able to reverse the process."
And if we can do that, then we might re-use traditional therapies and reactivate markers, proteins known as MHCs, and our immune system may be able to identify cancer cells.
"It could have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," said Professor Dawson.
"The lung cancer is a global disease.
And maybe we can do it in a much better way.
Researchers hope that this discovery will eventually be used to treat the facial tumors of Tasmanian devil, where cancer cells are in the process of escaping detection.
"A remarkable thing is that the exact same process occurs, Professor Dawson.
"So far, it has been very difficult to treat Tasmanian devil's tumor.
But if the drug that works for humans can be used for Tasmanian devil, it may be useful for tumor control.
It's a huge planet that orbits the smallest stars, and scientists are puzzled.
In the 30 light years from Earth, scientists have discovered a solar system that is blinding to the current understanding of planetary formation, that a giant planet orbits around a small star called a red dwarf.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image was released of the giant gas planet GJ3512b orbiting the red dwarf as its main star.
And that's why it's called stars.
In this case, however, stars are not much different from planets, researchers said on Thursday.
That star, called GJ3512, is about 12 percent of the size of the Sun, but the planets around it have at least half the mass of our solar system, Jupiter.
"Yes, that's quite surprising, as Juan Carlos Morales, an astrophysicist at the Catalonia Institute of Space Science, led the research published in Science magazine.
The theoretical formation model shows that a low mass star is usually the star of a small planet similar to the Earth or small Pluto.
In this case, we discovered a large gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star.
The planet, consisting mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Colour Alto Observatory in Spain.
It's a planet that orbits around stars for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and has relatively low surface temperatures.
GJ3512 is not only much smaller than our Sun, it's about the size of a giant planet, about 35% larger than Jupiter.
It's a very small amount of energy, so it's darker than the sun, and its surface temperature is about 3800 degrees Fahrenheit, and it's fairly low at about 380 degrees Fahrenheit.
So I'm coloring it red, and Mr. Morales.
While there is evidence that the second planet is currently orbiting stars, he said that the third planet could have been released from that system in the past and could explain the elliptical orbit of that planet.
Planets are produced from the same disks of intergalactic gas and dust that they orbit.
In the most powerful planetary formation model, called the core formation model, the object is generated by solid particles in the disk, and the gravitational pull of the planet's eggs makes it more sensitive to the surrounding air.
So, if we look at this, we're going to look at some of the different types of models.
"In this case, a primitive planetary disk surrounding a new star may have been a little larger and cooler than we thought."
So, this is a little bit more complicated than this.
And then you can see that these clusters of galaxies can grow until they collapse and form planets.
Deli's employee, a soydip mixed with methylamine, charged with feeding his colleagues
Marion County Sheriff's Department, Cassandra Medina Hernandez, 38, has been charged with feeding a colleague a dip of beans with a tranquilizer.
Thursday, Cassandra Ani Medina Hernández of Albany (38) was accused of taking on another person a serious charge of B-grade methofics and a controlled drug.
The charges are due to the incident at the liftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to estimates from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Sheriff Marion to let him taste it, as he saw Medina Hernandez making sobs.
According to the deposition, the victim told the agent that she had never had methylamine before, and “I thought after eating some of the food, she would taste weird, but she didn’t think it was a drug.”
When the women got back to work, their stomachs got worse and their feet became swollen.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, a local hospital where women go, the soydip could have been contaminated with methylamine:
According to The Smoking Gun, another liftway employee said that Medina Hernandez had "drunked" the victim's food, while the third worker said that he sent a message saying that the suspect had accidentally put it in a soydip.
According to the Oregon Live article, the surveillance video from Deli shows Medina Hernandez turning his back on the camera and hiding behind a microwave, pulling something out of the bra.
After that, they are supposed to stand up and wipe their noses and walk to the table and put the beans dip in a small paper dish.
The police said it also seems to have been placed on a plate.
According to Oregon Statsman Journal, the sheriff said he didn't think there were any customers who had been served contaminated food so far.
Medina Hernandez is in Marion County prison in exchange for 250,000 bail.
According to The Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest of Medina Hernández has been a crime of assault, robbery, robbery, theft, possession of methylamine, and possession of controlled weapons.

President JR East Sea, early launch newspaper Att es.
In a 27-day press conference, President Kinko Kimko of the East Sea said that the issue of the loss of water flow along with the linear southern Alps tunnel construction of Guinea should be divided between "the need to organize before the construction begins and the need to start the project."
I stopped talking to him specifically, "I'm going to talk to him at the meeting site and at the front of it."
President Kimko emphasized that once you've got all the problems organized, it's not easy to start them.
He also said, "This must be our idea.
There's a lot of concern on the side of the province that the water coming out of the tunnel will not be able to get back to the river.
He showed that when it comes to changing the way construction works for this response, "I can do it if I can, but I find it hard to think about it in terms of the safety of the building."
He denied that the change in route mentioned by Governor Tokuta is impossible.
The impact of the opening period was that President Kimko listed three areas of southern Alps tunnel, river station, and famous station as a place where construction would take special time: "I can't afford (others) but I’m most concerned about the area."

"The Public Hospital of the Need for Renovation" in Shizuoka, Japan, is reported as "LiVE"
The Ministry of Health and Human Services announced the hospital's name on 26 days.
The percentage of the three medical institutions surveyed in the province is 38/5%, the number of places in the country is zero, and the number of places in the country has already been either consolidated or transferred.
The hospital in the province has been announced as the National Hospital of Japan (Singa).
This hospital and Kunihito City's Citizen Hospital are jointly planning to build a new hospital in Tsubagakure, Japan.
The best hospital in the city is the center of community care and has been running the black market for the past few years.
He stressed that the hospital must be left behind for the residents, and expressed a negative view of revisions and integration.
The head of the Department of Health at Higashida Hospital said, "I haven't heard anything from the province," and I was able to say that I would be actively involved in the local community's community health planning meeting and would be dealt with in accordance with the nature of the discussion."
The local health support organization running Idayamaura Hospital said that it believes that "openment is not a mechanical decision on the direction of public hospitals, but a request to review them at a regional health plan conference in each of the districts of Tokyo."
The head of the Department of Medical Services, which explains the country's thinking to each medical agency, wants to talk more about the future of the hospital.
In some cases, they may ask for a review of medical courses or even a further reduction in the disease."
30 cases of bullying, 3 boys in a row, the newspaper Att es.
On the 27th day, a third party committee in the city examined a group of students who had heard of bullying and heard about it and revealed that there were about 30 acts of bullying and suspicion against male students.
In the future, we will examine whether it is true or not.
The Third Committee held their fifth meeting the same day, sharing with the entire committee the results of what they heard from the class.
According to the Third Officers, the students were either subsidized in the toilet or asked for cash.
The secret of the Royal family:
As part of the government, the Royal family has to travel all over the world hundreds of times over the course of its life.
Most of the time, it is easy to use a private plane, a royal one, to move the royal family around the world for important events and appearances.
Of course, you have the privilege of having a private plane.
It seems the Royal family is able to invite guests, including passengers whom they like and sometimes unexpected.
According to a recent channel 5 documentary, the queen and Prince Philip are not the only frequent guests in the royal family.
During the Royal Flight's Secrets show, the queen's former fliers, along with her family, were found to be frequent.
Bob Seas said, "There are times when you can ride a very important Royal Dog, just like a very important royal customer."
The Queen’s Kogyu is famous and it’s not surprising that she requests to take a pet with her on a trip.
Queen Elizabeth is said to have had more than 30 Kogy dogs since she was a child.
In 2007, he reportedly had five dogs, Monty, Emma, Rinett, Willow and Holly.
In addition to these five, there were five Coca-Spañel Bix, O'Kell, Flash, Spick, Span, and the ciders of Dachshund and Coggy mixed dogs, Berry Balkans, and candy.
The staff on the royal plane will be very busy.
Sears continued to be seen asking the royal staff to let the dogs off the lawn before boarding.
Happily, I've never had an accident before.
The program also showed that the queen's luggage was known by a shocking amount of travel.
According to the broadcaster, "on the 4,000-mile British federal tour of 1953, the queen's cargo was 12 tons."
So let's say I have two elephants.
But it's not just the queen who likes fashion.
The Duke of Cambridge is said to have his own taste for carrying his own clothes.

Former Senator of Alabama, Jack Edwards is dead, 9 years old.
Jack Edwards, the elected governor of Alabama who retired in the 0th term in the first wave of Republican march in Deep South, died on Friday.
Edward died at the home of Fair Hope after the disease with pancreatic cancer.
In the face of the growing Republican spirit in Deep South, many of Alabama’s Republicans were elected to the U.S. Congress, but Edwards was first elected to the US House of Representatives in 965 as one of its first waves.
Mr. Edwards served as the House of Representatives for the 0th term.
The family announced that Edwards recently asked what kind of world he wanted to leave for his grandchildren and that he wanted to return to the ceremony.
According to his family, he said he wanted his great-grandchildren to grow up in a country where he has returned to thanks for everyday conversation and efforts to solve his country's problems.
The governor of the state of Ibiyarabama said Edwards served states and states for the highest quality.
He also told me he was going to hold a half flag in the Alabama House of Representatives in mourning.
"Mr. Edwards was a true servant, the biggest politician in Alabama.
We lost one of the best politicians in the state, and Ivy said in a statement:
"It's delicious on the night before the helicopter's apology."
Prime Minister Yamamoto's 26th night Twitter post:
It was deleted at around 27 a.m.
In the final report of the incident of a battle helicopter that crashed into a house last February in Shibuya City, the deputy minister of defense of Japan, Yamamoto, who had entered the province for explanation and apology of the cause, tweeted: "It's delicious!" on the 26th night of the province's cooking shop.
I deleted the post after meeting with the governor on the 27th.
Yamamoto went on a business trip to Saga province on the 26th afternoon.
Iwada, a member of the Defense Minister of Defense, who sat in the meal with a photo of the Council of Representatives of Iwada, who said, "It's delicious.
Yamamoto later added on Twitter that "the chicken" was wrong:
Mr. Kanoro said he would "see" his comments on the post at a 27-day conference after the cabinet.
On the 27-day afternoon after I finished explaining to the three cities connected with the province, Yamamoto, who responded to the press, said that if anyone was uncomfortable with my message, it would not be my intention.
He highlighted his own decision to remove it, and avoided making it clear whether the tweets were inappropriate.
One of Yamamoto's officials, who was briefed on 27 days, said, "What are you thinking?"
Yamamoto was elected four times to the Senate.
I'm in charge of renovating the cabinet this month.
In the accident, the girl from the home at the crash site was hit, and two of the men on the helicopter were killed.
Michelle Obama, instagram, praised Megan Markle as inspiration.
On Thursday, Michelle Obama valued Megan Markle with a friendly Instagram and called the Duke of Sussex "a thoughtful leader who breaks the pattern and improves the world."
The Duke and Prince Harry had attended the youth's reception this week and met with the heads of the Obama Foundation during their 10-day official visit to South Africa with their son Arthur Harrison Mount Batten-Winder.
The former woman posted a very favorable post with "A thoughtful leader who breaks old customs and makes the world a better place, and my friend Prince Sussex.
Obama posted a photo of Princess Megan, who poses with the head of the foundation, and added that whether she meets with the Obama Foundation board or helps girls around the world who are seeking a measure of education, it is inspiring to many people.
Princess Megan, former actress for the suit, was a guest editor and interviewed Mrs. Obama in the September issue of the British magazine Vogue.
In the open conversation, the ex-president gave her an idea of how motherly and maternal nature changed her:
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said that being a mother is like being in an advanced class of giving up.
My job is almost always to find my children's self and give them a proper distance to grow up.
Not the ideal for their children as parents or the longing for their own childhood, but essentially to find out who they are.
In an interview with Good Housekeeping, Mrs. Obama, who actually learned about the world's pressure on spotlights, gave her little advice:
"There are times when I feel too much pressure from myself and others around me."
So I'm going to give you a little bit of advice on how to do it.
In the first few months of the White House, instead of working willingly, the girls started school and took care to make new friends.
But that's okay. I think it's better.
Janis Jr. Beauty boy, storm and SMAP music on Galawa’s fall!
I'm a fan of the "Beauty" stage.
The six-man group beauty boy of Janice Jr. performed a live performance of "Rakutten Gills Award 2019, AUTUMN/WINTER" in Messe.
[watching photos]
Fujisawa Fujisawa was fascinated by the show at Ideas Mile.
The event is the largest fashion and music event in Japan each year since the first round of 2010.
Various models and artists are showing up on fashion runways and live performances.
It's beautiful, with all the fresh members from the 2000s, when a boy is introduced as a Secret Artist, there's a yellow cheer in the audience.
The six of them will come to the stage, and when they come to the stage, they will take the main runway to the fans.
Start with "FIRE STORM" while the cheers are still ringing.
In the next group, Cover Medeley, Janis Medley, there is a popular song, such as "A.RA SHI" and "One Flower in the World" of SMAP.
Finally, I ended up performing on the "The Irresponsible" royal stage with six of the boy's original music "Cosmic Media."
There's no complaints about the owner of the card hotel, and there's no license to sell liquor.
Washington - Washington's D.C.'s D.C.'s D.C. Commission on Alcohol and Alcohol has dismissed the appeal that Washington should re-evaluate the local Trump International Hotel's alcohol license because the owner's fitness is questioned.
On Wednesday, a complaint by three members of parliament, two former judges and two Jewish leaders was denied the right for most of the applicants to file a complaint because they do not live in Washington or do not have a fixed asset in the state.
According to the Washington Post, this will be the second appeal to cancel the hotel's alcohol rights, based on state law which requires the applicant's "adjustence" to obtain a liquor license.
Last summer, the first appeal against President Trump's assault charges and repeated deceptions against the state's law:
The appeal was dismissed from its already recognized license.
The second complaint will be issued in keeping with the update of the permit.
First harvest of honey, gathered by the "flying beets" that Bentley breeds!
It's a little bit like that. It's a little bit like that.
In May 2019, beekeeping began on a crew farm in Bentley, England.
The beekeepers were able to collect more than 100 bottles of honey from just two hives.
How did Bentley become a beekeeper?
I want to taste this!
Here's 11 honey Bentley's hands.
Peter Bosh, director of the production department of Bentley, commented:
"To contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, at the beginning of this year, we installed our first hives on the vast property of a crew factory.
The beekeepers have seen bees gathering nectar from the wildflowers and surrounding mountains on the grounds.
It's great to know that this place is good for beekeeping, and that it has so much yield in the first year.
Bentley is working extensively through a crew factory and the company to become the head of a super-asstinable auto manufacturer, and it is part of the breeding process.
And we've got a lot of people working with us.
We're very happy that we got our first harvest, and we're planning to set up more hives next year and increase the yield of Bentley honey.
So, what we're going to do is we're going to take a small step.
We will continue to work in various ways in order to fulfill our role."
Then, in September of the same year, we were able to remove the hive from the hive.
You can see the bee's jar and the package, and you can see the Bentley-like granularity.
And we're going to talk about the design of labels.
The bottled honey is not only given to the staff but also made a gift to the customers and guests who are important to visiting the crew factory.
Britain is a country that values tea time.
So, we're going to have a little bit of fun here. So, we're going to have a little bit of fun.
Crebrand police, the worst news ever reported on corruption in the United Kingdom.
The D.A. has branded me as the worst in England.
The Cleveland police have been classified as inappropriate in every field in their report of fraud.
The Cleveland P.D. says Phil Gomley, police director:
In six years, the police have replaced five police chiefs and are now facing a call for a new dismantling.
According to the report, they stopped crime, arrested suspects, and failed to protect the weak.
Police director Phil Gomory said that the last time we investigated it, it's been very bad ever since.
The chief of police, Mike Vill, resigned within a year of his office in the month, but he was questioned about his actions "deeply" and several charges unconfirmed.
Deputy Director Adrian Roberts was suspended after being arrested for gross illegality.
Lieutenant Simon Harwood reported to the investigation committee for illegal activity last year because he had his colleagues engage in sexual activity.
He resigned from the police.
"This is the official confirmation that the police are breaking down.
Now is the time for the Ministry of the Interior to intervene.
The chief of police, Richard Lewis, said, "Well done, but I am responsible for the progress of reform."
(Laughter)
No one knows what's gonna happen.
"We now believe we are involved in a cover-up case, which could take some time to investigate," Perrosi told the federal parliament.
"I'm going to do the work I'm going to do based on the time it takes to find out facts," said Perrosi.
In the White House's record this week, Trump asked Ukrainian President Wallodil Selensky to investigate the pre-President of the 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
According to his phone records, Trump also asked him to help him and his personal counsel, Rudy Juliani.
Mr. Card denies fraud.
More than a week before the official hearing, CNN reported on Thursday that it was the defense attorney of the Justice Department for National Security who first noticed the charges against Trump, which involved Ukraine.
The Ministry of Justice, who was accused of asking questions from intelligence officials, decided that Trump's phone meeting would not be a political fund-breaking investigation.
In response to Mr. Barr's question of whether to testify, Mr. Perosi said on Friday that the Special Intelligence Committee will decide who should be witnesses:
But Mr. Perosi added that he thinks he's become a criminal.
Sure, the bar's been there a long time.
"Because the bar was named at the end," said Perosi, referring to Mr. Trump's name for the July meeting with the Ukrainian president.
It’s interesting that Mr. Barr will be forced to make a judgment about the charges.
Perosi said that he was very concerned about the informant who was the source of his information, when Trump attacked the accuser as a spy on Thursday and suggested that he used to treat the spies differently.
I think the President's statement is too irresponsible and dangerous.
Perosi said that the whistleblower was responsible for the corruption in the U.S. government, that it was important to make it public, and that the president said a terrible thing about someone who might have given information to the whistleblower.
On Tuesday, he called on foreign leaders to try to pressure them for political gain.
The call was included in a Thursday charge, and the whistler claimed that Trump had abused his authority to "instruction" Ukraine in the next presidential election.
He also claimed that the White House's attorneys had ordered officials to remove phone records from the cabinet system and transfer them to a special security system.
Crystal, pales' forwards, Christians, Bentek, and the driving violation.
Premium league stars, Christian Benteques, arrested for driving twice in two months.
Crystal Palace's 28-year-old forwardward said, "On the 20th of May, he drove his Bentley and admitted that he drove 50 miles an hour at a speed of 30 miles an hour at A3 in southwest Richmond, London."
In March, the Belgians were shot by speed camera at over 89 miles per hour at Patney, southwest London, twice the speed of 40 miles per hour.
Benteke, who lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey, doesn't have to appear before a court of security in Lavender Hill this morning.
Benteke confessed to the two offenses under a single argument that was handed down by the "Cultain Justice" in early July.
9.2% of Taiwan's high school students have experienced an increase in the percentage of non-instructional health authorities (Central Focus Taiwan) - Yahoo! News
The National Health Service of the Ministry of Health, September 26th, published the results of a study on sexual relations between high school students in Taiwan.
And that's what we're talking about here.
It also showed that about 1 out of every 5 of these women didn't have an abortion.
The study was conducted in 2017 for students enrolled in high school, high school, and high school.
The last 15 years of research show that the proportion of students who have had sexual intercourse dropped slightly from the last 11.1% to the last.
On the other hand, 22.6% of 15-17-year-old men and women said they did not get pregnant because of the latest sexual activity.
It turns out that both boys tend to increase by 28.8 percent (the last time), and girls 16.2 percent (the same 13.5 percent).
It pointed out that today's youth are more likely to get online information and are more likely to think wrong.
It calls for proper knowledge, not only of pregnancy, but of infections and other risks.
This is Takumi.
Ghana: Kofi Manu, concerned about the committee.
Kofi Manu, a football expert and executive director of Cecondi Khasaka, expressed his concern about the formation of the next Ghana Football Association (GFA) election committee:
I questioned whether I would include Mr. Frank Davis, and expressed my frustration about it.
In an interview with GNA sports, Manu said the chairman of the committee was concerned about the outcome and questioned whether it would be fair to include the chairman.
The committee should form a fair and neutral member from outside without any relation to each committee or any previous interests.
For example, Davis signed a contract with the NC as a lawyer and wrote to Osei Kwak Palma about the payment:
He's also known as the Olympic champion.
On account of his interests for these two reasons, Manu argued that the board should not be allowed to carry out a task.
While Mr. Manu, the Olympic director, said that if he attended the board, his association with his club would create a conflict of interest on the head of the board.
The members of the committee were scheduled to leave on October 4 after the ceremony held at the GFA Akura Office on September 19.
The chairman, Frank Davis, of the Corpore Galvanins consultants, is a lawyer, Marian Barnoor, and Emmanuel Darkwar.
The other members of the committee are Reginald Lairea, a marketing officer, and Richard Acapocavi, a sports lawyer.
A survey at Fukui Institute found that 54 and 2% of Fukui’s small and middle-class companies consider the minimum wage to be a good reward for their country's minimum wage increase.
While 90 percent of the 20"8 years have been recruited, the percentage of companies that say they have been "suspected" is around 50 percent of new graduates and middle-aged employees, 30 percent of those who are under-privileged, and a 30 percent of those who are struggling to get paid came up.
The companies who said they were "yes" to raise the yen per hour were more information-related (00 percent), construction industry (70.6 percent), and wholesale (6.7 percent).
The majority were manufacturing (5.9%), eating, drinking, and staying at a service (60.9%).
The director of the conference says that while there is a high rate of opposition in parts and time-intensive industries, many companies are finding it difficult to get people and are trying to increase the cost of human services.
When the company that said, "No," was able to raise the amount of money, the average wage was 985.
"When I heard that they were hired in March, September, they were 6% recruits, 54.5% middle-aged, and 5 and 4% non-conformity companies were involved.
Eight and six percent didn't recruit.
The percentage of the companies that had a "sustained" number remained 44 and 7 percent new students, 50 and 3 percent middle class and 3% non-normal.
Especially the transport industry, 3-3%, 37.5 percent, and construction work.
For example, 86.4% of the company's employees have employment challenges, and the number of applicants is low in number, and the number of applicants is low in company fame, and "not good for wages" is listed as the number of employees.
There were many calls for a second degree (out of three years after graduation) and for further introduction and information.
Some have asked for the support of the students' approach, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the province and supporting various internships.
"5 and 3% have already confirmed" in the country's growth strategy for sub-orbital and business.
"I'm going to admit it," he said, "and I'm going to admit it.
The number of companies calling "not" was 64%, with construction (82.8%), retail (73.%) and manufacturing (72.7%).
The investigation took place on July 9th, August 2nd.
I got a response from 298 companies (29.8%).
JR's line of road damage (KTN TV) starts again - Yahoo! News News
The JR Line, which had witnessed the traffic damage to the train by typhoon 17, has resumed driving since the beginning of the 27th morning.
The JR's line, the direct Sado Line, and Nagasaki's main line, started on the 27th morning and went back to normal.
The JR Line was in the middle of the river shelf and his station.
The train of JR in Nagasaki was reduced in number and the diamond turmoil continued.
In the last video, we saw that, according to JR Kyusaki, Japan, the repair work was completed for 26 days, and that it resumed its operation after running the test train in the early 27th day.
Typrick, the voice of a decisive battle with a man.
“It’s a moment,” says Justin Tiplrick in the fight against World Cup Mount, Australia, where Wales decides where the tournament is going.
If Wales wins Wallabys, the most hot candidate for pool D will be sure of the semi-finals against France or Argentina.
If, on the other hand, Australia won the 14th victory of the Battle of Wales, it would be the eight best battles between the British and the British.
"Of course, I'd like to win the top of the group with both teams, and end up at the top of the group."
So far, the battle against Australia has been severe, but I'm glad I won last fall.
Australia is going to be pretty hard on you to pay you back, but until you do your best to win it again.
I knew this game was a mountain before I got here.
And now we're here. Now is the time.
In the last World Cup, Wales won only one victory, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and victory over Wallabys is the third-ranking battle 32 years ago.
And for the three southern hemisphere heavyweight teams under Warren Gatland, only seven won during the 41s.
Wales stopped losing the Australian test match last November at 13, but Tiprick was among the several delegates who won the match at 9-6, one of the players playing at the Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
He was asked if he didn't think he was going to win before the victory, and he said: "It's hard to answer.
The game was tough, maybe, but I don't know how many people could win.
As a result, I gave him about 15 points in the final match, and it seemed to me that the score was much higher than it really was."
For Wales to win, there's a pair of Australians who are worshiped as Back Roe, Michael Hooper and David Pocock, and a breakdown battle with Tiprick.
With his experience with the 67 games of international competitions, Tiprick has fought with a number of other players in the past, and he knows exactly what he’s waiting for.
"They are definitely world-level backstairs," he says.
I always know that I'm going to be in a tough game when I'm going to play back and forth against the world glass.
They're always at the highest level in the world.
So I know exactly what kind of game it's gonna be.
Pocock is one of the world's most aggressive backst players, and Michael is one of the most aggressive, but he may be more aware of the rugby in the sense of being in the right place when necessary.
I'd rather fight the world's best player and raise myself up than fight backroe who's not strong enough.
I want to fight the best, and if I fight those two, I'm gonna have to get better.
I'm not saying this Sunday is a final, but for us, it's a big game in the World Cup.
It's important.
If you keep up the good performance, you'll be able to get the rest of the race.
"The Madness, the local silence, Ireland, the W-w-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W
On 28th, a local fan watching a rugby W-cup in a pub in Irish capital Dublin, showed a sharp look on his face.
On the 28th day of the 28th of the 28th in a powerful Irish community that was defeated by the Japanese champion at the World Cup of Lublin, local fans, who had been running to the pub in the morning, stood silent on an unexpected defeat.
Public RTE can't hide the shock of saying, "This is an amazing and brave Japanese madness."
The match in Ireland started after 8:00 a.m. local time.
The pubs in the capital, Dublin, which FB Carney is co-operating, are filled early in the morning with fans.
Before the match, I was so sure of victory, but as the last game got worse, there was a loud shout like "no."
When the whistle rang at the end of the game, there was silence in the store.

A government subcommittee's meeting to discuss the treatment of nuclear water in Tokyo's Fukushima nuclear power plant, Tokyo's Port of Tokyo, 27 p.m.
In a 27-day government subcommittee considering how to handle the growing water supply at Fukushima nuclear power plant, Tokyo Electric presented the possible facilities and specific procedures for domestic and domestic shipping.
Because of its radioactive material tritium and so on, it's focused on anti-responsibility, assessing the density of matter, and saying it's urgent to stop when it's detected an abnormality before it's released.
I want you to be clear from the board how long it takes to figure out how long it will take for the procedure presented at this day's meeting.
We should consider the social time line too."
The East Enders, the News: Ben kissed the column after the bombing news in Whitney.
In East Enders, the Catney Highway was surprised at the sudden bombing of Whitney Dean, and the column was restored to its lover, and the intense tension between the column and Ben Bowers is about to explode again.
But is the relationship between you two gonna start, and you're gonna regret this hot moment?
Ever since the column helped Ben and the needy Bobby Barnel, the relationship has progressed slowly, but the column recently told Ben that she was happy to see him weak or gentle.
Tonight, Whitney comes back from vacation, feeling a lot better than before he went.
It's clear that it was very effective for her to leave Walford right after the tragic wedding and the supposed groom was discovered to be having an affair.
When Whitney came home, he had an argument with the column.
Soon, however, Whitney found out about the news and hit the column with a slap, and the column's wobbly.
The column is upset, and Jay Mitchell is worried about watching the Gab in Queen Vic.
The drunken, emotional column rides to Ben, pours out everything that has happened, and blames Ben.
Ben calmly takes her anger and comforts her, and soon they kiss her, and the frustration changes into passion.
But what are you two gonna do now?
They tried to date the next week, but Ben was given something to think about, and everything he was trying to do with it would be ruined.
But new and confident columns face gay fathers and decide to fight to get what they want, what they deserve.
The East Ender Kiss episode will be broadcast by BBC at 8:30 Friday night, September 27.
Is it true that if Kimimoto is taking 90 percent of the Galla, it's a gift from a geisha?
A series of events that led to the black market against the anti-social forces have also brought the issue of Gala to a close.
In a July 22 interview, President Okamoto said that the company said on the average, "5 to 6.4" on the average, but the geisha were against it.
If you take 9% of the ratio of "9:1" with you, then you can also see that the geisha have given you a gift, and investors have been retweeting over 30,000 times.
So let's do another example.
I've been told by the Council of Taxation.
● The law is not to be taxed in the first place.
So let's do another example.
It's not an individual, it's not an individual, it's a legal matter.
If a million dollars' worth of work were '9.1', then the box industry would make a million dollars and a $100,000 difference.
This is a legal tax.
So let's say I have a tax.
And even if the geisha were wondering about the distribution, they're not arguing that the amount they actually receive is different than the amount they're supposed to get.
So let's say I'm willing to pay $1 million.
The gift should not be made a personal gift if the host is not aware of it by saying, "I'll give you a round of money."
So if you're dealing with something that clearly has a price (for example, buying real estate) and you're dealing with something that's different from what you're supposed to be doing with a tax account.
But the third parties will not decide what is the fair price for what both parties have made in exchange.
I'm sorry to hear that.
In 2008, after graduation from the university, I graduated from the tax attorney's office, and passed five courses in bookkeeping, financial, legal, tax law, and inheritance law.
There is a wide range of services such as university lecturers, seminars, and writers.
It's not that simple, but it's very easy to explain.
The White House, it's a panic attack.
On Thursday, the White House officials were on the move to counter the pressure of a new Democrat, and those who knew about the matter explained that they had a sense of panic this past week because there was little plan to deal with the emerging reality.
One close to the White House said that there seems to be a growing "anxiety, anxiety" about the possible damage caused by whistleblowers to the president and some of his neighbors.
The man said he didn't have much of a reality.
The White House officials joked that there is no clear plan for the situation, that the usual measures that the president has come up with so far can not be applied, that the complaint is so serious that they are not sure how to proceed, and that it is not likely to be erased by the news that comes next time.
Another person familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as being "shocked" because the president would be more "out of control" if the interrogation continued.
Another source says that during interrogation, the pressure of the president was seen to increase daily, and that some of his closest associates believe that he is even more impulsive in his behavior.
They are worried about the president and politics in the election year environment.
The cards have faced the greatest threat in their presidential term, and have turned their backs on the strategy they have decided effective during Robert Moller’s investigation into Russia.
The card tried to ignore the request made to the president of Ukraine to help in the investigation of his political enemies, to attract attention to the party's candidates and to try to discredit whistleblowers for reasons of opposition.
However, many of the members of the White House have endured the test of the Molar investigation, but this time they are beginning to feel different.
The president, whose power is a brand, said at a Wednesday press conference that someone who knew the situation seemed to be here:
The cards enjoyed asking questions about the Russian investigations, but apparently they were not in the mood to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that they can reduce the damage by claiming that they did not have direct information about the controversial President of Trump and Vorodimir Selensky and the call of the Ukrainian president.
And while it is common for the president to be attacked, there is a growing wave of support for the defense of these facts.
However, a Republican strategyr near the White House points out that the President's basic support rate is already very high, and that it will not have much effect on the acquisition of new supporters by the warheads.
In particular, if it interferes with the legislation and monopolizes the news around the clock, "there is no advantage in focusing on the next four months."
Another source says that those who claim that warheads can be of help to the president are not fully aware of how uncertain he is.
Concerned members of the White House seek advice from their advisers in order to organize a response team.
According to those who describe the project, the initiative is still in its early stages, but it still remains to be seen in what form it will take to implement a strategy-based approach.
However, he said there is a feeling that there is a need for a clear leader to organize public relations to counter the announcement of organized strategy and communication strategies, and the announcement of critical internal prosecutions, and to counter the momentum that this has generated in the Democratic campaign.
According to informed sources, the lack of a long-term strategic point of view is evident, such as saying that Michael Ponpeo and the Secretary of State Steven Muncin will not publish a note about the call to the Ukrainian president of Trump after 48 hours.
According to those involved in this investigation, the person involved is called the pit bull outside the Trump, who was the head of the campaign.
But Luwanski told NBC news that it is not accurate to suggest that he is the leader of such a initiative:
“We have been doing everything we can to support the president and his policies for the past five years, but we have never discussed joining a team to fight back against this false story,” he said.
Jay Sexlow, outside attorney for the Mollar investigation, is also getting involved in the war effort.
In an interview with NBC news, Sexuallo said the matter would be handled properly.
Emmett Flood, who was involved in Clinton's war and led the White House until the end of the Morra investigation, left.
For the most part, information on the strategy of the White House said that the officials were far away from inviting people and developing strategic teams, but they knew that they needed someone to organize them and lead them through all their efforts and political struggles.

● A minority of couples marry out of a distant love relationship
She's dating a year and a half and she's in love with her boyfriend.
I mean, there's a saying that two people get stronger when they're tested at a distance.
A survey conducted by DeNA Travel (in August of 2017, by 1147) by Professor Mikikawa, is well known, but the data shows that only 16 percent of couples who have gone from distant love to marriage.
So, since romantic love is done through five senses, the relationship begins to deepen by looking at the other person, hearing the voice, holding the hand, smelling the scent, and kissing.
But in distant love, most of the time, you hear your voice on the phone.
It can be difficult to keep company in a state of hearing alone.
So let's do another one.
If you're going to the other house, you're going to have to go to the other person's house because of the time and effort you're going to have to travel, and you're on holiday to relieve the fatigue of your work.
I'm going to go home and I'm going to go home and I'm going to be very sad.

Devin Nuñez blames the Democrats for demanding "Trump's Nud Photo"
Senator Devin Nunes (California Republicans) seems to have no patience for the idea that Donald Trump is being investigated.
On Thursday, in a comment to the president's defense, he condemned the Democrats who tried to get a Nudo photo of him.
Senator Nunes, the Republican head of the House of Information Committee, filed a statement in a hearing about an internal charge that Trump called for an investigation into the Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democrats of wanting to see the full picture of the president.
"A Democrat from this special committee said he negotiated with some who were thought to be Ukrainians with the aim of obtaining a Trump Nude photo."
It’s natural for everyone to ask why the Democrats are so excited to shoot the president, and within a year they have the chance.
After Mr. Nunes’s reprimand, a senior political reporter at Huffpost, Jennifer Bendei, decided to determine whether the Democrats are trying to find the truth.
The only person who has ever responded to this question is a Connecticut Democrat Congressman, Jim Heims, and many other members of the party, who are wondering if his answer is a red light of truth.
Medite Dotcom speculates that Senator Nuñez's Nudist comments are not related to “more subtle and unconfirmed details” that are supposed to have been written in controversial Steel documents.
It was a notorious report by former British agent Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking complaint against Trump.
Origami, wallet and real cards.
Transmission, loan, insurance, investment - Yahoo! News
Origami Wallet is an app that allows transfers (to be moved) through transfers and financial accounts in addition to the payments made by Origami Pey.
They'll add to the charge.
Start financial services such as loans (borrowing), investment (growing) and insurance with partner companies.
In other words, you can use financial features like paying, moving, charging, borrowing, multiplying and preparing for them at Origami Wallet.
“We will create a new financial service that will solve the problems of young people who have to live with pensions and low interest rates” and said, “I want to make it an equal service for those who are distant from the financial system and who have never been benefited by the system.”
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have Origami ID, you will be able to complete the Semeres from the application to the deal and that you can get information from time to time.
He also explained that by expanding not only on the Origami app, but also on the app of a partner company, he would make it available for services that are available without an app.
In this video, we'll show you how you can pay later when you make payments.
In addition, even when the money was suddenly needed, he decided to complete it on the Origami app from his application to pay back:
As a partner, I'm here to introduce you to my partner, Nisei, and to my first life.
I told them that I was going to use the data and knowledge that both of these companies have and that I'm going to expand insurance products along with life events.
Financial services are being provided through registration and expansion of necessary administrative agencies.
▪ "Origami Technologies" a new project to make effective use of data.
On the same day, Origami announced that the company launched "Origi Technologies" to support effective use of data, including the company's data, in addition to the digitalization of customer points by their pay, based on the accounting function provided by Origami.
In the "Origami Network" company, which combines with Origami's accounting functions, it is recognized that effective use of data, such as obtaining structured data, such as sales, and not structured data, and storing, processing and analysis of data, is a challenge.
In this post, we're going to show you some of the things that we've been able to do in the last couple of years, and we're going to show you how to do that.
They are going to contribute to the use of effective data and to the development and transformation of new business models using digital technology and data.
On the next phase, the key is how the business model will be expanded using data.
"I want to create innovation for the next phase, using data from Origami Network and a lot of corporate data."
The details of specific services are announced in turn.
In addition, on Origami Conference 2019, we will mention the future of Origami's initiatives, such as delivering coupons to his phone when it rains.
And now, on Origami Pay, the compensation is complete, but it is made clear as an institution.
They also announced that they would be working as part of the community, working together with the tourism association and so forth.
On September 7 of this year, a party was held in Osaka, Osaka, on September 7, at the time of the honor of the National Assembly of Musical Arts in Tokyo, Japan, to celebrate the first Korea Medal of the Year, the singing of the singer Mitaka Koto, who died at the age of 100 in July.
The people involved presented the music of Kotohara-san's delegation.
About 140 people from Japan, including his own people, including the husband of Japan's Director of Japan's Department of Japan's Ministry of Music and Arts, joined in.
I'm going to do it again.
"I still can't believe he's gone," he said, but as he prepared for the "School Meeting," he felt the great and greatness of Mikahara Mitsaka-kun and his death.
And then he said, "If only we could do something that would allow us to expand our meeting."
After silence was offered, the Korean Morning Arts Association, the Messege, Director General of the Chuu Institute of International Studies, was introduced.
Renewable biofuel research could reduce emissions.
In recent years, even though electric cars, Tessera trucks, and Semi have become the exclusive news, the only thing in the air is a plane that can't reach renewable energy.
But a professor at the University of Alberta developed a technology to make renewable biofuels available as jet fuels.
Dr. David Bressler, professor of environmental sciences in Alberta, started the project in 2003.
His lab is developing hydrocarbon fuel from oil from restaurants, livestock rendering, canola and other oil waste.
Unlike Ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use low quality oil oil to produce, carbon emissions are 85 percent less than crude fuel, and other industries can use waste in production.
This technology also affects the regeneration of hydrocarbons in crude fuel.
Dr. Bressler said that in the first generation, this technology was actually achieved by hydrogen hydrocarbons in the molecules of diesel gasoline itself.
Although it's a new option for biofuel use, conventional biofuel technology tends to cool down and become unstable, causing serious problems for high altitude planes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma," said Dr. Bressler.
It's not worth as much as diesel, but there are requirements.
Dr. Bressler's lab now looks at two options: biofuel for jets.
So there are two ways to do this.
The second option is to continue to study chemical reactions that have remained stable even under low temperatures, already partially developed.
Dr. Bressler said about the second option, "you can try it in a reactor to make a slight change in chemical reactions."
This option is risky.
As airlines, Canadians and U.S. military forces have increased their investment in renewable options, the company Forge Hydrocarbons at the University of Alberta is working on production.
"They're predicting that one day someone's going to tax carbon in the future," he said.
I'd like to have an alternative plan for the worst case.
Now, Foge is running a testing plant near the waste control center in Edmonton, and recently he has invested four million US dollars from Locked Martin to help build a $25 million U.S. production facility in Sombra, Ontario.
The factory will produce about 19 million biofuels a year.
Dr. Bressler suggests that carbon reduction is about 85 percent, but that the rate of reduction is not increasing on the side of transportation and production.
"As an engineer," says Mr. Bressler.
So, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to make an option.
Shikita's charm, and I'm the third grader in Iwata.
Fukushima-san is working on this project.
A third grader from Iwada, Japan, is working on creating a series of stories about the tourist attractions and traditions of the Shizuoka area, such as the Ismajima and the Kijima festival and the bridge.
They're collecting money for crowdfunding until the 5th of December, and they're considering distributing it to local kindergartens and rehabilitation facilities for free after it's finished.
We're working on a project called Fukushima-san (8), Nakamura-san (8), Nakamura-san (7), Fujito-san (7), and Shida-san.
They have been working on it since February last year with the idea that "I want to tell a lot of people about the community's charms."
Photos used for painting cards are taken on the ground or taken from city officials.
It's very close to completion, and it's got a history and a description behind it.
Fukushima-san says, "I especially want kids to enjoy it."
The target for crowdfunding is 300,000 yen and will be paid back in full if it does not reach its deadline.
I'm going to search for more details in the "Punished" section.
(Lisemum) - Yahoo! News
On September 26, 2019, the Japan High School Board released a final invitation to attend Yoichi High School.
We take care of transsexuals who have no sexual connection with their minds and bodies, and eliminate gender labels from their application form.
Selective Date
The decision to attend a high-level high school was made by a single book with a list of statements, documentation, requirements, requirements, application procedures, academic examinations, passing announcements, and other reference material.
It's the most important thing in the world: it's the selection of the general admission, the selection of those who are recommended, the selection of those who are enrolled in high-level high school, and the selection of those who are qualified from outside.
Until 2019, I had placed a gender label on my application, but in the process of selecting a person for sexual orientation and the need for proper care for the diversity of sexual recognition, I would cut the gender from the gender style of my application in the 2020s.
The most popular academic test is the five schools of languages, mathematics, society, sciences, and English.
So, what we're going to do is we're going to take a look at what's going on here.
The test time for each course is 50 minutes.
In this case, the time required for the answer is 45 minutes per hour, and we'll set up a five-minute time required for the inspection immediately after the start of the test.
So let's do a couple more examples.
From January 21 to 24th, 2020, the public-elected reception reception reception was held at 4: 00 p.m., January 29 to February 4, 2020.
The recommendation and joint selection will be made on February 21st, January 24, 2020, at noon, February 13, 2020, and so forth.
When the brigzit is covered, the prime minister calls for calm to be faced with a riot like Los Angeles.
Last night, a high minister said that if the second vote is reversed, the country is in danger of a “hidden” riot.
Prime Ministers warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France for economic inequality and the violence of its citizens on the scale of the Los Angeles riots in 992.
Johnson said he needed to “responsive” his anger against the political language in which he argued, but he insisted that he would not stop using the word “lost.”
Despite the appeal of the Prime Minister to regain his calm, one cabinet minister told the Times: "In this country, there has never been a "Gird Best Movement" or "The Los Angeles riots in 992.
People don't think it will ever be a riot in this country, just because it hasn't happened before.
We already have a yellow best example - they have encrypted their mobile phones and then there are several populist leaders who are trying to stir up people with their dirty hands.
In Los Angeles, a riot broke out when a jury sentenced four white police officers who beat up a black taxi driver, Rodny King, in '99.
This year, French demonstrators with their yellow vests are causing confusion and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
The minister pointed out Johnson's warning at the House of Representatives and said if the British failed to leave the EU, "trust in our political system would be destroyed."
"When 30 million people vote in the polls, 6% vote to stay in the EU, millions of people don't like it," he said.
Even if 99 percent of the voters are opposed to leaving, the most angry ‘0 million people’ will not give up writing letters to Congress.
It won't be long before tens of thousands of people are on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second vote could reverse the results, the country would be in danger of an ‘intense violence’.
Johnson asks for a general election to be held and to leave Bregjit's decision to the voters.
Johnson has been reported to be facing a rebellion in the House of Representatives, seeking to lower the demand for a leave of the EU, instead to compromise with the EU.

Pakistan, the famous brother of social media, who spent his life in prison for the honor killing.
Women's rights experts say that it is often time to delay the procedure and execute sentences, and that the murderer accused of it will be released, and her memory will be diluted.
Falzanabari, a women's rights activist and founder of the first gender school in Pakistan, added that it took more than three years to resolve the Baloch incident, even though it was noticed:
While human rights groups say it’s difficult to prove reliable data, the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "primitive murders" in August.
Many human rights advocates say that the actual number of honor killings is much greater, since they estimate that Pakistan owns about one fifth of the 5,000 honor killings that occur worldwide every year by surveillance groups based on honors.

A long-term monsoon flood and chaos in India and many parts of the world.
India's monsoon season has been "long enough" for months, an unprecedented rainfall has destroyed buildings, caused death, and has begun to corrupt much of its crops.
Usually, in northern India, monsoons weaken their forces at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall of this month has increased by 37%.
According to experts at the Indian Weather Agency, if the situation continues for a few days, the monsoon will weaken at the slowest point in the past few decades.
In many parts of India, there is still an unprecedented rain, and the latest news is that in the western Indian Sune, several buildings have been destroyed by heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
The houses were flooded, the people were carried across the streets on their knees, and are usually seen only during the heyday of the monsoon.
Other cities, including Kolkata, Rakna, Hyderabad, have also been hit by heavy rain.
In the northern state of Uttalarkhand, heavy damage has been done to houses due to the prolonged rain.
The monsoon's coming too late.
In many parts of the world, water was scarce, and farmers prepared for drought.
I don't like the long monsoon for the farmer.
It's not normal at this time of year.
Prakas Mehera, a small farmer in Bimtal, Uttakand, said that he is now making cabbage, peas, peas and tomatoes, but the rain will poison the vegetables.

It's not just that we've been exposed to a lot of chemicals.
The latest studies show that working around high concentrations of pesticides can lead to higher risk of heart disease.
This is the result of over 30 years of tracking the day-to-day Kreop of a Japanese American living in Hawaii.
Researchers have found that people exposed to large amounts of pesticides have a 45 percent higher risk of heart disease and heart disease than men who did not work around the pesticides.
"What's highlighted in this study is the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to chemicals at work, of writing medical records where there is an exposure to chemicals at work, and of reducing the standard risk of heart disease," says Dr. Beatriz Rodrigues, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodrigues is a professor at the medical department of the elderly at the University of Hawaii in Manoah.
This was the result of a study of data taken from more than 60,000 men on Oahu Island who participated in the Kuakini-hoor heart program.
The researchers say that this study is directed only to traditional men and may not apply to women and other races.
The chemicals have a long half-life, and the effects of health may come after years of exposure.
This study showed the greatest impact within the next zero years after exposure.
"After 34 years of tracking, the exposure of pesticides at work and the relationship between heart disease and heart disease are no longer important," he said in a news release.
This is likely because other factors related to aging are more important, concealing the potential relationship between pesticides and heart disease in the evening.
Researchers have found that there is no significant connection between exposure to low or medium amounts of pesticides and heart disease.
Polochenko intervened at the Zerensky lamp phone meeting.
It was a very unusual week in Washington's political affairs.
For the first political man, Vorodimir Selensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed up by political scandals.
But what has been learned so far about the problem of the celery lamp phone, and how far - reaching is the impact of it?
In the very early part of the telephone meeting, Trump told Selensky that the United States is more comfortable with Ukraine than with other European countries.
Although the phone records released by the White House are non-communicative, it's detailed that Trump is criticized for focusing more on discussions between Prime Minister Angela Merkelen and other European leaders than on specific proposals.
The reply of Zerensky, who said that the cards were 100 percent against the cards rather than 100 percent, is controversial.
Selensky added that both President Makrón and Merkel did not support Ukraine enough:
The conversation inspired politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, to argue on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Polochenko posted on Twitter that EU support has never been received before:
In addition, Polishenko tweeted that he appreciated the support of the EU’s sanctions and financial support in the "State of Russia":
Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytishka said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
The Trump suggested military aid, asked Zerensky to do two more investigations instead of Joe Byden's son, and the second was a survey of the servers of the hacked Democratic National Commission, which suggested that Ukraine had been involved in a Democratic e-mail invasion during the 2016 elections.
Is this an obstacle to European relations, or is it a backlash against the French and German leaders?
I don't want to speak ill of anyone.
"Thank you to the people who support us because of the announcement of the phone records," he said at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Selensky is scheduled to meet with Russian, German, and French leaders at the Four Summit in Normandy, scheduled for October.
I won two awards for the International Civil Aerospace Agency in Ghana.
At the 40th International Civil Aerospace Association held in Montreal, Canada, Ghana won an honorable two award.
The safety award received 89.89 percent of the success rate in Ghana and accredited Air Safety Director to the highest score in Africa.
Prior to this, the ICAO had completed an ICVM investigation operation (ICVM) on April 3, 2019, following the United Nations Air and Space Administration World Security Directorial Report.
The safety award is the result of the fact that Ghana has been recognized to adhere to the criteria and agreements recommended by ICAO on safety at the airport and in the national airspace.
These awards were created in part by ICAO in support of the zero campaign.
In addition, in a safety assessment, "6 papers, security assessments, 7 certificates were given to ICAO countries with improved security standards.
The award was received by Joseph Kofi Adagar, Minister of the Air and Air in Ghana, Simon Aloti, Minister of Civil Air in Ghana, Ambassador to Canada in the field of Icoy O'Ou, and Yau Kwakwa Air Company in Ghana.
In his speech, Ormywa Benard Ariu, the director of the International Civil Aerospace Agency, stressed the need to maintain air safety in the countries participating.
He said it is important to keep aware that air security, security, and stability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation.
And Ada said that the award was a sum of perseverance and endurance in the sector, a gift of Ghana’s efforts.
He also pointed out that there is a huge potential for the airline industry to develop its own economy:
There are social and economic benefits there, all of which are security and security that we have achieved.

Mr. Card, Peter Gianno, appointed High Commissioner FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, deputy secretary of the United States Department of Emergency Management (FEMA), smiled on the testimony of the FEMA budgetary hearings at the National Security Council Committee at Capitol Hill, Washington, U.S.A., on April 3, 2019.
Washington, D.C. - According to the White House, US President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gianno to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's High Commissioner on Thursday.
Gianno, deputy director of FEMA, was in charge of the government's response to disasters, such as hurricanes and fires.
The Agency has been absent from the Senate since March, when former Secretary Brock Long resigned.
Homeland Security, FEMA's top organization, has decided that Long's use of a government vehicle between Washington and his home, North Carolina, has been compromised, and has resigned.
Another recommended agent, Jeffry Biad, was absent earlier this month after the investigation, was suspected of getting drunk and getting involved in a brawl.
Mr. Gayno's appointment was as expected.
From now on, the majority of the Senate's approval will be required.
Before he was appointed vice president of FEMA in 2018, Gaynor was on duty at the Emergency Control Agency in Rhode Island and had Navy soldiers, says the White House:
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana barping in San Gabriel Valley
- The police shut down the illegal marijuana bathing operation in San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After a police warrant was issued at 4:37 p.m. on the suspected sale of illegal marijuana - marijuana - marijuana products, a large container of bunganny oil was found in an office building 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Kano of Elmont police said that the investigators also found equipment to pack the Bay Cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," said Lieutenant Canno.
Lieutenant Kanno once engaged in a drug investigation and said there could be a fire in the process of extracting the oil used in the Baep product.
"It's possible that even static electricity from clothing can trigger a fire, and it's concentrated enough to cause an explosion," says Lieutenant Kanno.
If there were more than one container like that, there could be more explosions, more fires, and the whole building could be blown away.
The security squad was summoned to an empty office and seized a substance that was illegal and dangerous.
The price of confiscated goods and equipment was not immediately announced.
An anonymous tip led to a search warrant at the scene where they found illegal activity, said the investigator:
Investigators are still trying to figure out who is behind the illegal Baep operation.
The police said they thought that the office was empty and that he had set up a store in the office.
As the investigation continued, the police said they wanted to get the latest news on the danger of Bagging and not be seen again.
Lieutenant Kanno said, "I don't know if it's real or not, but it's something I buy."
Products can be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may cause much harm to our community and children, so the police are always warning people not to come near to such activities.

The collection of dresses at the Histrick Royal Palace, Elelli Lin, confirmed that it was a point.
Lin saw this piece of cloth on the wall of a small church in the middle of the country, which was supposedly stationed there a hundred years ago, as part of the clothing that was lost from worldly dress dances.
Three years after Mr. Lin stumbled upon this magnificent piece of cloth used as a altar to the church in Bakuton, Hellfordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be displayed next month at the Hampton Court Palace, where this Tudor queen may have worn it more than 450 years ago.
"There's only one other dress left in the sixth century, and it turns out it was an important discovery in the entire royal dress collection.
There is no complete proof that Elizabeth went through that dress, but three years of research has convinced experts that the dress is not a royal property.
The most expensive weaver cloth, the silver thread, was provided only for senior members in the royal court, but the "master" plant and flower stings were added later to the deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen, and bears.
When the dress was made, it was probably about the price of a Tudor house.
In addition, in the late 1590s, it is estimated that the queen would not be able to endure the threats of other women in the palace and the rivals wearing such lavish clothing.
Ms. Lin says it's important to publish, so she's been visited by a colleague of mine.
I've always been so happy to see the cloth, and I've always been so happy to see you say, "Wow."
A piece of dress used as the altar of the Unknown Church of the Holy Face in Bakuton seems unexpected, but not so much.
Bakuton is a village from Blansh Parry, who served as queen Elizabeth for a long time.
Although the dress was after Parry’s death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth must have gone to her family or church to celebrate her death before her death in 1603.
For over a thousand hours, the altar, which was spent on a very delicate hand stitch with a special dyed silk and a fine surgical needle, will be displayed next to the "Impression of the rainbow," one of the most admired modern paintings borrowed from the Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The only room available for a very expensive tapestry is a renovated greenhouse in the Hampton Court property, where the storage work is mostly done, and Libby Thompson, who instructed the work, said, "When we deal with historical cloths, we have real respect for the skill of the people who made them."
When you look at the stabs on the head and back, you see the great respect of the people who made it.
I've never seen anything so sophisticated.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held on October 12.
"A week after the missing girl was searched, the self-defense team dropped out, and the volunteer men were missing."
It's been a week since the missing girl in elementary school at the camp in Yamamura, Yamamura.
There's still no sign of them. The Self-Sefence Force has finished its search for 28 days and has been evacuated.
The search for the 28th week began at 6 a.m. by the police, the Self Defense, and around 240 people.
But the village called for the SDF to evacuate the area they requested, and the search ended at noon.
For 25 to 4 days, the Self Defense Force put 650 people at high risk, including the slopes and the wells of the mountains, but they couldn't find any clues.
And on the 27th day, we lost track of a 20-year-old male who volunteered for the search.
Police and fire are planning to continue the search at 6:30 a.m. on the 29th.
A vote-in-the-blank lawsuit, the first oral defense, MRT Miyazaki.
It was a constitutional violation of the election of the election this July, and the first oral defense of the election, which called for the ban of the election, was held in Fukuoka Miyazaki's Office of Fukuoka.
According to the court's decision, the plaintiffs argue that the single vote is worth 0.71 votes in Miyagi and 0.48 in Kagoshima, compared to the least votes per member in Fukui province in the country in July this year.
In the first 27 days of his first oral argument in the Office of Fukuoka-dono, the plaintiffs claimed that "the value of a single vote was unequal and constitutional."
In response to this, the state's campaign committee called for the dismissal of the case as "not so much an inequity of constitutional issues but as a constitutional right."
The verdict will be passed on October 30.
An interview by the conference delegates.
I'm Shizuki, the lawyer, the representative of Shizuoka.
On the 27th, a press conference was held by the Japan Association of Foreign correspondents in Chida, Tokyo.
The meeting was conducted by the conference's representative, the lawyer, and three of the school's school teachers.
On the issue of the anti-abortion system, which began on October 1 and will be excluded from 88 schools, including Korean schools, the delegates complained that it is an "indecent discrimination".
The end of the morning is 20,000, 700 yen.
The Tokyo stock market average of 225 species has fallen drastically on the 27th morning.
The previous day, the US stock market was heavy, the lower was more than 300 yen per hour, and the price was about two weeks during the deal.
The sales order was also reduced.
I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about it.
Topic Price Index (TOPIX) is 257.52.
The day before, the market in New York was threatened by a war on the President of Trump America, and 30 Dow industrial averages ended their deal with a drop.
Tokyo market took over on the 27th.
A world called "ShangHI" (Ovo)
It's also a very popular painting and Gutz.
Is there anyone who has a pot LINE stamp or a key holder?
Since the opening of Yokohama and its theaters, the "snock musical" that's been gathering up the topic will also move abroad.
The opening to Shanghai by the end of October 2019 is the "Hungem SHANGHI" in China and Shanghai.
SHANGHAI is the largest site in the past (703m2).
The content consists of four areas: the "unstagenic area", "unstallic area," where you can know the world's hags, "unsteaderic area," and, yes, the "untakic area" area where this game can be enjoyed.
Some people have always been aware of this quality, and others ask, "What does it mean to be cute?"

Tokyo Motors Show 2019 - Yes! News News
In the Tokyo Motors Show 2019, which will be held on Tokyo's Big Show from October 24 to November 4, the Liquor Car will be the world's first major truck-to-Giga model.
Giga, a flagship model for a squawk truck, added to the latest advanced safety and expanded the fatigue and restructuring equipment for drivers.
It also contributes to safe driving with pedestrians and bike brakes, blind spot monitors, and lighted LEDs that help to control car accidents and lane change.
Also contributing to the driver's fatigue by cruises between cars that follow ahead at full speed and by new Heilufcabs.
In addition, MIMAMORI, a system of vehicle running and dynamic management, has also expanded the vehicle status entry.
The fail-safes are being monitored.
We're also going to create a show model that describes the future stream network as "FL-IR".
The first is called FL-IR, which is the focus on the similarity between the ultrasonic conversation and behavior of fish and the connectives and row traffic.
The exhilaration features a bio-engineering model that gives the shark an image of an efficient robot as a feature of style, with the contrast between an organic wind-scattered vehicle and a rigid air device that surrounds it.
The interior used a layer design that was replaced by a hand-to-hand and automatic driving mode.
Sheets are placed at the center, with both comfort and housing.
It's also the world's first public service for the next generation of mini-cars, Elves Worksrovan.
We are concerned with the driver's working environment and the efficiency of the distribution.
The driver's seat is equipped with a rotation seat.
It also has a safety system, an electronic mirror system with a wide range, and a 3D view of the entire vehicle.
In addition to this, we will produce the first hybrid bus ever developed by Sunno, "Elgaduo" and "Elph," which have made extensive improvements, a diesel truck that will produce a diesel 4JZ1 engine that will meet the latest emissions regulations and provide both fuel and fuel.
We're also going to show you how to get involved with the PREISM and natural gas cars in video and panel installations.
In family space, you can use touch panels to see how different tracks are used in video, or photo booths that allow you to become a truck driver.
We've arrived at the space station.
We've arrived at the International Space Station.
The station's robotic arm extends from the bottom left (by NASA).
The International Space Station has successfully caught and applauded the 8 aircraft.
Aerospace Research and Development Organization that carries supplies to an international space station of about 400 kilometers.
The resupply was launched on 25th day from the Tokishima Space Center in Kagoshima, Kagoshima.
We're not going to be able to fly at the same speed as the station, but we're going to be able to get close to the speed difference.
It's a seven-and-a-half-millimeter robotic arm that's holding up the resupply.
The supply machine has about 5 to 3 tons of supplies on board.
After you've been attached to the station, the flight crew will carry your stuff.
I'm involved in a third of the Mexican drug cartels, U.S. internal drugs.
CBS News captured a rush hour for drug trafficking right after sunrise from Chicago, West Side.
The DEA's Brian McTnight has revealed what's going on in broad daylight.
In Chicago, nearly 800 people died of overdoses last year.
McTnight said that maybe 90 percent of the drugs traded in Chicago were brought in from Mexico.
The DEA is focused on a Mexican drug lord named El Mencho and Nemecio Cervantes.
A Mexican high-ranking agent, Matthew Donahuea, said that Mencho was the first person to ask for the DEA and, in fact, the U.S. federal law enforcement agency.
El Mencho won $10 million.
With Donahhew's help, dozens of El Mencho's drug companies have been exposed in the forest.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisko Nueva Enerción, is involved in at least three-thirds of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel has been selling a lot of cocaine, methyl and Fentanil mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck is worth $10 million.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but he was arrested for drug abuse and returned to Mexico.
So he started a vicious cartel.
He owns a lot of weapons, a loaded rocket, a .50.
Donahue said he actually owns his own special motors.
From the fall of six Mexican Army helicopters, El Mencho is protecting his empire without punishment.
Thousands of murders have been committed in recent years by drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government's statistics, about 94 murders a day have occurred.
In Chicago, seized Mexican drugs are highly toxic and must be worn when treated.
The cocaine bag is marked as a trafficker in the manufacturer's office.
More than three-thirds of El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahheh said that Mencho is involved in the flow of toxic substances that are actually taking the lives of innocent women and children."
"It's more likely that when someone's child dies, it's a drug brought by El Mencho's organization," she said.
Over 67,000 Americans died of overdoses last year.
We're sending a core to the United Kingdom to breed at the Osaka Abbey Zoo.
Aquara "Ark" (Anglo), a male loaned to a British zoo to breed, is 28 days old.
Children who write for the koala's 'Arc' farewell party on 28 days at the King's Temple Zoo in Osaka, Japan
On the 28th of the year, the King's Temple Zoo held a farewell party for the only male in Osaka.
To breed, we're supposed to go to the British zoo in mid- 0th, and we're more likely to never come back.
- Thank you. - Good luck.
About 600 guests gathered in front of the Coa-ra complex, which was full of eucalyptus trees, missed their goodbyes.
ARC is two years old.
The life of the koalas is expected to be completed in the 'five to twenty years of life in England, where they have been married.
The farmer in charge, Tetsuki Kunihito, says, "I'm not going to put a curtain on the corala.
Soney, Play Station 4 Surprise News.
Sonny revealed the contents of the PS4, the Last of Ass, part two.
As part of the recent State of the Place, Sonny released the February 2020 release of last of Ass in last year:
Part of the exciting video of the new action game was also presented to the fans:
More details have been published a few days after last of Ass2 news.
Sonny and Nortidog seem to be back to normal in many ways.
Last of the Ass Part 2, which I haven't seen since PSwan's time, will be released on multiple disks.
In a great interview with the Telegraph, Nortidog Neil Drakman even announced that the following has evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
“In a different sense, the story is spectacular and complicated,” Drakman said.
So, this is what we're trying to do.
We didn't intend to create the biggest game in history.
"I was excited about how much this story is going to expand, and the user felt that this was the end of it, but in fact, they realized that it was the beginning and the beginning of all the other sections."
The game didn't get too big and one blueray, but it got two disks.
In addition, Rust of Ass Part 2 says that if you open up to work, there are two or three bad Easter eggs.
I don't want to ruin this surprise, but Easter Egg in the game has something to do with the work of my old Nortidog.
If Rust of Ass 2 were to be released on PS4 on February 21, 2020, we'd know a lot more.
If you have PS4, pick up Rust of Ass Resid with PS+ and prepare for release.
Sonny recently released a free play station plus PS4 game, including the above-mentioned Notidogs in October 2019.
MLB's show 19 will also be released in the month of '0' for PPS plus members.
If you like Rust of Ass-Lessad and you want to book a follow-up, Sonny has already released several games, including the popular character Ellie’s backpack and the leprechasette's 12-inch figure.
The Council will try and continue to wish for the residents to continue.
In the process of advancing in years, on the 26th day of Shimashima, where there were fewer businesses in the city, the movement started by the residents of the Mamashima District and the Reservation Council.
"A van full of supplies, flavors, and food from a trial up until February, began its first day in half-town and half-town.
Some of the products were quickly supplemented by more than expected sales, while some residents were asking for continued "responsible selection of goods."
The van had zero points on it, including a total of vegetables, city garbage bags and detergents.
So that you can eat an old man who lives alone.
The town council sold salt and sugar.
The council's Kunihito Shimei looked surprised to see that he could not have sold so much.
I've been hoping that Ms. Mitsaki, who is usually shopping for her husband's car, will be cheap and convenient, and that Daddy will always be able to drive, and that he will continue.
The user also ordered me to pack a cup of coffee for myself.
The Council will consider all the items requested.
Today, only a convenience store can buy daily supplies, and the council tried to sell the move to save the "stretch."
We'll see if we can continue as a business until February, after next year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he decided to add about $100 million to the drought victims:
The policy of cash support for drought-torn farmers has been extended, and the benefits of existing farmers have been greatly re-employed to simplify them.
In addition, about $34 million will be measured in support of drought victims, and the farmers will receive an average of 3 grand emergency aid.
As an aid to the drought-instruction program, up to 13 municipalities will be helped with drought relief, with up to a hundred million dollars to build infrastructure and combat drought.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted more than 7 billion dollars to support droughts.
Ronald Lee Haskel: The murder of his ex-wife's family in Texas.
Ronald Lee Haskel (39) was convicted of killing four of the five children in Spring, Texas, Mr. Stevens, Katie Stace, and his children.
The authorities said he broke into Stain's house on July 9, 2014 and questioned the whereabouts of his ex-wife, Melanie Haskell.
Melanie was away, but she had a sister, Katie Stacey, and a family.
Hasker shot, Steven Stain, Katy Stain, 4-year-old son, 9 and 7 years old, and the Harris County Police Department announced:
Only one member of the family, then 15-year-old Cassidy Stat, survived.
At the time, authorities reported that he was seriously injured, but then he recovered completely.
Thursday, the jury was in agreement to reject the plea of innocence for the loss of Ronald Lee Haskel.
The jury was dismissed until Monday.
"If you make a choice to disappoint us, you will never forgive me."
Did the complaint of the angry girl sound to leaders from all over the world?
Global warming is getting more serious.
At the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg spoke out to strengthen the measures.
It's become a global spark for "school strike" to spread around the world, like boycotting classes and sitting in front of Congress.
Young people, who have raised fears and resentments, have protested in one place around the world, including Japan.
"It is estimated that about 4 million people have joined in more than 50 countries.
They marched up the message board in Kyusaka.
The threat to climate change is close at hand.
In the late part of this century, the Paris Treaty, which starts its full story in 2020, aims to make global greenhouse gas emissions virtually zero, reduce the rise of temperatures before the Industrial Revolution by less than two degrees, and limit the rise to five degrees.
Every participating nation, without distinction between developed or developing countries, takes the necessary measures.
However, there are extreme weather events that have been linked to warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains.
The rapid warming process requires a step-by-step effort.
At a summit called by UN Secretary General Guterres to strengthen the crisis, 77 countries have expressed their long-term goal of virtually zeroing by 50 years.
The other 70 countries tried to raise their own goals.
China and India, on the other hand, who are disseminating the Paris Treaty, have failed to reveal their new goals and have become a prominent part of the destabilization of the nuclear powers.
The criticism of Japan's coal-fire power is strong.
The government's long-term strategy holds as high an emissions as possible in the latter part of the century, but it's a great distance from the countries aimed at 50 years of zero.
There was no opportunity for Japan to give a speech at the summit.
Kojiro Kojiro, who showed Japan's initiative at an environmental-related meeting, said that when meeting the issue of climate change, he should "be happy, cool and sexy".
I don't deny the appeal, but I'm too poor for the girls' complaints.
I don't have a problem with Gretchen, who is now symbolic of the environmental movement.
Incontrovertible slander can only be a counter-argument.
There will no longer be a respite from global warming, and the international community will have to deal with the common crisis.
We don't want enough success in our efforts.
There's a lot of young people and children behind Mrs. Greta.
A lot of people should act so that they don't take away their future.
And that's what it's all about.
The U.S. Army's research has led to the realization of quantum Internet.
In such an Internet, it may be possible to provide military security, measuring and timing that were impossible for traditional networks.
According to the U.S. Army Research Institute's Dispersive Quantum Information Center, funded by the U.S. Army’s Institute for Battle and Development, researchers at Insbruck have completed a record of the transport of quantum entangling between matter and light -- 50 kilometers (50 kilometers) of fiber cable.
So, here's what we're going to talk about.
If two quantum bits are in entangular state and measured on one side, even if the other one was far away physically, the measurement would be affected by the other.
"This distance [50 km] is two-digits bigger than it had been in the past and is a realistic way to start inter-urban quantum networks," says Dr. Ben Lañon, a research scientist and project researcher at the University of Insbrook, who published his results with the information in Nature’s quantum network.
So, in this video, we're going to talk about inter-urban quantum networks.
The variance of this envelope is absolutely essential for quantum Internet development, say researchers.
"This proof is a big step towards realizing massive dispersal entangling entangment," says Dr. Sara Gamble, deputy director of the Army program.
And the entangment at the exit through the fiber has enough quality to meet the requirements of some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team started experimenting with calcium atoms caught in an ion trap.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ion, while at the same time encouraging quantum intelligence to release stored photons.
This is what's happening in the universe.
The challenge is to send the light beam with fiber optic cables.
"The wavelength of the photon released by the calcium ions is 854 nanometers and is immediately absorbed by fiber optic cables," says Dr. Lañon.
So his team sent the light particles through non-linear crystals, which were fired by a strong laser.
The wavelength of the photon was converted to 1550 nanometers, a standard wavelength of current distance communication.
Then this light beam was sent through a fiber optic cable 50 kilometers long.
And so, in the measurement, even though the wavelengths were converted, the atoms and the light particles remained entangent.
The reason why they're used is because they're able to capture a high-quality "clock" bit at the same time, and the results of this experiment are exactly the same as that of an entangled network on an atomic clock for a long time.
The large Entangular clock network is a very important area for the army from the exact positioning, navigation and timing applications.
