For example, the most popular type of image in the world is 35mm, which had the size of the films that were spectacular at the end of the history of this kind of ancient films.
It is still being developed today, but the most important is the growth of its photographs where it has been proposed as a way to take photographs from digital cameras.
Interestingly, the so-called format is 35mm in fact with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
Aspect ratio of this format (it divides 12 to get a simple number full) so it is called three: multiple.
Many common formats (APS family of APS formats, for example) are equal or close to verifying this level of sharing.
