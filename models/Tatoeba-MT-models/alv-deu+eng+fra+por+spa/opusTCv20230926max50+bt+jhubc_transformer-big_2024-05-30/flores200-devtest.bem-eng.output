In savanna, it is difficult for animals to use food as a human to meet the needs of amino acids.
In this regard, failure to meet these requirements has serious consequences: discomfort, food shortages, and eventually death.
The most common vegetation is the protein found in the lungs and soil vessels, but these factors are difficult to absorb from animals just as humans are.
In contrast, animal-based foods (insects, insects, eggs, eggs) are not only easy to breathe but also provide many proteins that are needed for all the amino acids.
As a result of all this, we may be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protective problem" in the same way that the savannahs act today.
