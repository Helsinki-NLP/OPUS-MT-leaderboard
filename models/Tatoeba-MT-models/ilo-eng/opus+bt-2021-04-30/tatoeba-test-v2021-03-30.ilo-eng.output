He struggled to win the contest.
I need to go to the toilet.
Tom Walks.
You've guessed that I'm angry.

We're born between urine and takki.
This skin of mine is smooth.
I'm sure Tom wants it.
Everyone has his own opinion.
I'll tell him in due season.
Will we wait for Tom here?
What we need most now is a little patience.
Do you know what happened to him?
On my way into school, I usually see a lot of ass-ass and pussy.
How did you respond?
Who is guilty of this?
What is it supposed to be?
