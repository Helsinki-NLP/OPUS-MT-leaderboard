Winter is not dangerous for healthy people.
Words, words...
They're working on.
Do you want to order?
Yes, I'm from the board.
Yes, of course.
It was Sunday, not Saturday.
Are you well?
You're always listening.
You're a singer.
You're a singer.
You are doctors.
You are everything for me.
You are in my way.
Say it.
Say it.
You're in silence!
You've got it?
You can go if you want.
Now you can go.
It would be better if it didn't go away.
You decide to.
You don't have money.
You're taking a bath.
You are my mother.
You have a few books.
You've got the bees.
You've got a tub.
You have a meat.
You have my permission.
You have water.
You have water.
Ahhhh, the witch!
You like elephants.
You can find all those who are willing to pay for it.
You need my permission.
You're getting a door.
You're taking the door.
You're a beautiful girl.
Now you're a teacher.

You're in charge!
You're Emily.
It's.
You're in.
You're in Europe!
Now you're misunderstood for me.
You're not a doctor.
Don't listen.
You don't have to do it here.
You're sad.
You're sad.
You're sick!
You're insane.
You're very low.
You're very low.
You're very low.
You're very low.
Nothing.
Her mother is very beautiful!
That's what you say!
You're learning English.
You've tried.
You're not being shy.
You've been stunned.
You've been distracted.
They've never been in their company.
