Welsh additional MPs are concerned that they look like puppets.
Some MPs do not understand why their deputy status should change to the status of \"Member of the Parliament of Wales\".
MPs resented over plans to change the name of the local assembly to the name \"Parliament of Wales\".
MPs of all political views suggest that this is some kind of deal.
One Labour MP said his colleagues were concerned that this rhymed with the words \"stupid\" and \"failure\".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means \"stupid\", and pwp means \"non-darek\".
The deputy said her group was completely unwell and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss changing the name of the assembly, but noted that it was a short word transition from a member of the Welsh Parliament to a \"marionette\".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced as itself, as does the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is now drafting the naming amendments law, made the statement: \"The final decision on any description of what the assembly deputies call it will, of course, be an issue of the members themselves.\"
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives Welsh East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals that found widespread support for calling the assembly the Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the title of an additional MP, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales or CPU, but the CUP option received the most support during public consultation.
Additional MPs are obviously proposing alternative options, but the way a consensus reach may become a headache for the chairman, Elyn Jones, who is expected to submit a bill of change over a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the work of the assembly, such as rules on disqualifying additional MPs and changing the structure of the committee system.
Additional MPs will rule the final vote on the issue of how they should be called if they do their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters vote to change their country's name to or against the \"Republic of North Macedonia\".
The national vote was organized in order to address a perennial issue with neighboring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens, they long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represents a claim to their territory, which prevented Macedonia's inclusion and friendship in the EC and North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, a member of the name change referendum, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a cost to be paid for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The name of St. Martin's Temple is silent; the bocercves in Harlem struggle for existence
\"Rather, as the old people I spoke to were a bar and a church at every corner,\" Mr Adams said.
\"Today Here Nor That, Nor the Second\".
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
\"People have different intercourse and relationships at present,\" he said.
\"Bars are no longer cozy local guests where people walk constantly.\"
As for churches, he worries that money from selling assets will not hop for such a long period as leaders expect, and sooner or late they will return to where they started from.
The churches, '- added it,' may be replaced by residential houses with condominiums filled with people who will not help temples that will remain in the area.
\"The vast majority of the dwellings who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,\" he said, \"and so it will accelerate the day these churches close together because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these condominiums will become the hostess of these churches.\"
Both churches were built by the white community before Harlem became a black district  - Church of the Standing Society in 1870, St Martin's Church  - a decade later .
The original white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The black community praying nearby was granted ownership rights to the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black-skinned public under the leadership of the likes of John Howard Johnson, who headed a boycott of traders on the main trade in Harlem 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but worshippers under the leadership of Father Johnson planned a reconstruction: they introduced carillon.
Like David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called carillon \"called poor people\".
An expert who played carillon in July called this otherwise: the \"Cultural Treasure\" and - \"an indispensable historical instrument\".
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, switched to a larger carillon in Riverside Church .
Mr Meriwezer said he was not replaced in St Martin's Church.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months has been a complex history between architects and contractors, some of whom have been attracted by the false leaders of the church, others  -eparchy.
The march of the faithful is the governing body of the coming, consisting of the chaplains' assistants, - wrote to the diocese in July with the transgression that the diocese would \"try to translate the costs\" to the assembly of the faithful, although the assembly did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors who were sent by the diocese.
Some hikers complained about the lack of transparency by the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy during a daubing to catch off the Lobsters in California.
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who hunted lobbyists in California on the day of the season's opening catch of the Lobsters.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach in Ensignas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that Saturday morning he was doing a dowing with his friends for half an hour when he heard the boy scream, begging for help and then swam with the rest to help pull him out of the water.
At first, Hemel thought it was just an excitement from catching the lobosters, an alley then he \"understood that something bad happened: 'I got bitten!
I got bitten!\"
\"All his keyman was torn apart,\" said Hamel , adding that he noticed this when he approached the boy.
I screamed to everyone to come out of the water, \"In the water next to the shark!\" \" added Hamel .
The boy was transported by air to the Reidy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The variety of the shark that made the attack is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that the shark had been spotted at this location a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe variety.
Giles added that the victim sustained injuries to the top of the torso.
Chynovniks closed approaches to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for safety purposes.
Jailes noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks living in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to progress to the British beauty market\"
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams, opening departments with beauty goods in the university where the waked specialists will work.
As part of the significant promotion to the British beauty market with a turnover of Â£2.8 billion, which continues to grow, while the amount of sale of fashionable clothes and household goods is dwindling, larger beauty houses will be represented in 11 salons across the country and also in other new salons next year, which demonstrates success.
Investments in the beauty realm come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on shelves that used to be occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and goods for the house.
Sainsbury's said it would double the volume of beauty goods by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which would appear for the first time.
Existing assortment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in firm departments similar to those that can be found in stores such as Boots.
The large stores will also restart their boutique cosmetics lineup, so that most products will be suited to vegans, and this bidder becomes increasingly demanding among young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in south London, and the second will open in Seley Oak, Birmingham at the end of this year.
Buying online and moving to buy small quantities of products every day in local stores near the house leads to supermarkets having to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said trade points would be increasingly similar to those of the university because the supermarket network tries to compete with the Aldi, Lidl drives using more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos trading points in hundreds of stores, and has also hosted several Habitats points since it acquired both networks two years ago, which he says contributed to the growth in food sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The supermarkets' previous attempt to reconstruct their beauty and pharmacy wards did not end successfully.
Sainsbury's protested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to split revenue from pharmacy stores ended after a series of deal in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after three years ago Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business along with 281 Celesio stores to pharmacy network owner Lloyds Pharmacy for Â£125 million.
It was stated that Lloyds played a role in this regard, extending the assortment of luxury brands in skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said, \"We changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in teaching our employees who will be able to offer their recommendations.
Our assortment of brands is designed given any needs, and attractive facility and comfortable accommodation make us the best beauty house that opposes the old way of shoping.\"
Peter Jones disenfranchised after Holly Willoughby turned down the deal for Â£11 million.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones distraught after television presenter Holly Willoughby turned down a deal of Â£11 million with his brand specializing in the image of life to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to brand goods for Truly's home and accessories.
The couple's business became similar to the Gwyneth Peltrow Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old lead announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now parting ways with her lucrative business of creating brand clothes to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones had divulged when a \"golden\" TV girl admitted during Tuesday's tense meeting at his business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals worth up to Â£1.5 million mean that she would no longer have enough time to deal with Truly's household goods and accessories brand.
The business was similar to the Gwyneth Peltrow Goop brand and was increased twice to double Willaby's Â£11 million welfare.
When 37-year-old Willowby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones took off from the UK and headed to one of her vacation homes.
Source reported: Truly was Holly's main priority.
This came her long-term future, which she would see after a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all participants absolutely stunned.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday, very soon had to begin lunch.
The Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts suggest that the departure of the leading This Morning, which enters into the number of the most significant British stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investments in various goods - from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods - as well as due to possible further delays with their exercise.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and husband Dan Baldwin were close with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple rest together, and Jones owns a 40 percent share in the television firm of Baldwin.
Willowby will become a presenter of the M&S brand and replace Auntie Mac Partlin as the leading ITV \"I am a celebrity\".
Last night, a source close to Jones reported, \"We will not comment on his affairs.\"
Honest conversation, \"after which we fell in love\"
He fires about the criticism he receives from the mass media for his comments, which he believes is \"non-presidential\" for what he says positively about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump give up a lot?
Trump told his orderly \"dictary\" voice.
\"I don't give up on anything.\"
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was announced by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But negotiations for denuclearization went into the deadlock.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, leading North Korea diplomat Lee Yen Ho said to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not expected \"relevant westerns\" by the United States in response to North Korea's previous steps in the field of disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
\"We are very successful in building a relationship with North Korea\" he said.
\"Everything could end the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We now have good attitudes.\"
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim produced positive results: completing missile tests, helping to free hostages, and returning U.S. troops' remains home.
And he defended his extraordinary approach in talking about a relationship with Kim.
\"Being on the President's side is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to infiltrate this crowded arena, we're already going to have about 200 people there,\" Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have ravaged the island, and hundreds of people have died.
For example, after the earthquake on c. Lambock, foreign NGOs said they were unnecessary.
Despite over 10 percent of Lambock's population being displaced, no national distress has been declared, which is a necessary condition for international aid.
\"Unfortunately, in many cases it was understood that they were not addressing international aid, so it was a little difficult,\" Mrs Sumbung said.
Though the Children's Rescue Foundation (Save the Children) and gathers a team to travel to Palo until it is clear if foreign employees can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopa, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Pal to find out if international agencies will be allowed to assist.
Despite the earthquakes that Indonesia always survives, the country is still well prepared to incapacitate nature.
Although shelters were built in Aceh, there are almost no shelters in other shore towns.
The apparent lack of siren for the tsunami warning in Palu led to more casualties, though the warning did.
Even in better times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia has been a difficult task.
And the tedious disasters made it difficult for the logistics to move.
The hospital vessel, which was located on c. Lambock to treat earthquake victims, approaches Pal, but the way to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widoda focused his pre-election campaign on improving Indonesia's demolished infrastructure and spent money on road and rail.
But a lack of funding is being pursued by the Jock administration as there will be new elections next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from continued interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority representatives adopt more conservative Islam.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machete, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.

The number of tsunami casualties in Indonesia has increased to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, the Agency's wound to eliminate the aftermath of natural disasters on Sunday.
At a press conference, Sutopa Agency spokesman Purvo Nugroha said that according to reports many people found themselves in a trap in ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points, which occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 7 meters in height.
The city of Palu, which is home to over 380,000 people, has been inundated with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after they stabbed a woman.
An investigation into the murder was started after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with knife wounds in the Grayson-Meuse area of John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called for people from this area to be addressed, who have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, \"The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead or see or hear anything suspicious, and ask them to contact us.
I also urge everyone, particularly taxi attendants, whose video registrants may have taken some kind of video off, to contact us as they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation.\"
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, lived next door to Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
Today afternoon, friends of women came to the scene of the event to inquire: where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they were in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson-MÃ¼z had just tried to return to his apartment, but police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or walk out of the building.
He lost his tongue when he learned what had happened.
The Jiharam are now told that they will take a few more hours before they are allowed to return.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue was the last vecapome blow in the case of \"rewriting history\".
His removal would be a poetic justice for his similar to the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, committed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
\"But Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as 'thundering' and 'trying to rewrite history'\".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: In the course of the current debate on the statue's dismantling, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's monument near Westminster Palace would become the object of these actions.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps bad Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
A vivid representation by Mr William Ham Thornycroft of Cromwell is a testimony to 19th-century thought and part of the historiography of an act which many believe should be honored so far.
Mr Goldsmith stated to The Sunday Telegraph, \"Cromwell many know from the late 19th century it is better than today, as a defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation, the subject of a lengthy historical debate.
It does not cause doubt that the mid-17th century conflict formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individualized cognitive figure representing one side of that encounter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to mark and honor them.\"
A pig-killer decapitated to the death of a Chinese farmer.
As reported by local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
\"The man, who is only known by the surname of 'the Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery and inflated blood, next to a shed in the Lupanshui market in Guizhou province,\" the South China Post reported on Sunday.
Swine was preparing to introduce a vaccine to pigs in a pig on May 30, 2005 in Sinin in China's Qinghai province.
He reportedly and his cousin came from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the nearby porcupine was unlocked.
He said there was a big knyr in the pigtail with blood on the snout.
According to the report, forensics officials confirmed that the 550-kilogram knyr had decapitated the farmer.
\"My cousin's legs have been covered and damaged,\" said a cousin from Wu's surname (as quoted by Guiyang Evening News).
A video from the surveillance camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been shut down to prevent an attack on someone else, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
According to reports, the Yuanya family and the market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although cases where pigs attack people are rare, they were also before.
Yes, in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts State, resulting in serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds pressed a Welsh farmer to his tractor and kept so until his wife let the animal go.
After a farmer from the state of Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood could act like a descending hook.
\"They're just playful.
They're bitten and very inquisitive... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect,\" he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rose will bring heavy torrential rains to the southwestern United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weaker because it is moving over colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, \"Rose\" will bring floods in northern Mexico and the southeastern United States.
The speed of \"Rose\", a Category 1 hurricane, was 85 miles/hour at 5 a.m. according to Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was recorded 385 miles southwest of Punta Euchenia in Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low pressure begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, as it moves eastwards, towards the west coast of the United States.When Rose approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin pushing deep tropical moisture to the north, to the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring up 10 inches of rainfall to some parts of Mexico.
Then tropical moisture, which interacts with the coming area of low pressure, will call out strong levees in the near days in the southwest.
The sites of 1 to 4 inches of rainfall call out dangerous sudden flooding, selee currents, and possible swells in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will result in rainfall rates as high as 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially most of Arizona, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected.
Due to grouped areas of tropical rain, sudden flooding is possible, subject to rapid deterioration in conditions.
It would be very undesirable to go out into the desert on foot due to the possibility of threatening tropical rainfall.
Strong rain can cause the canyons to turn into stormy rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by a parvising wind and dust.
The coming area of low pressure will bring heavy rain into parts of the Southern California coast.
Possible summarizing precipitation by more than half a inch can lead to a slight flow of garbage and make slippery roads.
This will be the first levee in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain will begin approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday before the rain will go everywhere late Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread in the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, there may be strong temperature overruns in the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes results in sharp temperature changes in the nearer.
There is a good example of sharp temperature overruns in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amaha, Nebraska, St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, long summer heat will try to strengthen and expand again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern states of the United States, warm October will begin with a temperature of 80 degrees - from the Southern Plains to part of the North East.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern part of the United States by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavan's hearings.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched interesting indications of witnesses on Thursday in the Supreme Court case between Brett Cavan and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual violence, which supposedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continues, broadcasters interrupted their regular programs in favor of emergency news on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it was to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that a drunk Kavanaugh had grabbed her and tried to pull off her clothes at a party at a senior school.
Kavanaugh said in his staff testimony that 100% sure it wasn't.
Probably over 20.4 million people, which Nielsen reported on Friday, looked at him.
The company calculated average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And the Nielsen campaign usually has trouble assessing people watching the TV in offices.
For comparison: the size of an audience is the same as when playing a playoff or an Oscar Award.
\"Canal Fox News, whose experts decisively supported Kavanaugh's appointment, managed all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the day,\" Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
\"The CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had a 2.94 million, MSNBC had a 2.89 million, and CNN had a 2.52 million,\" Nielsen said.
Interest remained high and after hearings.
Flake was a major figure in the drama on Friday.
After the office of a moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in support of Cavan, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when protesters shouted at his address and when he tried to climb the elevator for a hearing before the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes lowered for a few minutes when he was incensed, and this was broadcast live on the CNN Channel.
\"I stand right here in front of you,\" one woman said.
\"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, \"You have power, but a lot of women are deprived of it.\"
Flake said his office released a statement, and reported before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the committee hearings.
All cable and broadcasting networks ran a direct broadcast for several hours, when the Judicial Committee was to vote on the issue of selecting Kavana's candidacy at the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he would do it, only realizing that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, which Democrats from a minority number are calling for.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made the decision.
The choice of Fluke had strength because it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to confirm Cavan without investigation.
President Trump began an investigation into the charges against Cavan into the FBI.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of \"playing politics\" because of Brexit
During an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May blamed critics for the fact that she plans to leave the European Union that they are \"playing politics\" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party conference in British Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In one of the interviews alongside her on the first strip of the newspaper was her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who opposed her so-called \"shaky\" plan on Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EC had the only tariffs was \"always ridiculous\".
Wade Sims' murder: Police arrested a suspect in the death of LSU player Daitheon Simpson.
Police arrested the suspect in a deadly shot at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana team.
\"20-year-old Daitheon Simpson has been arrested and placed in jail on charges of second-degree murder,\" said the Baton Rouge police leadership.
Chinovniks showed a video of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the shooting.
\"Police have taken glasses from the scene and said that Simpson's DNA has been detected on them,\" \"reports WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After being questioned by Simpson, police said that he confessed in a fatal shot to Wade.
\"Cost bet set at $350,000 level,\" Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge investigation office published a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Department's operations group, the state's Police Criminal Laboratory, South University Police are asking residents of the area to assist in the investigation that would contribute to the arrest.
The Louisiana University's sports director, Joe Aleva, thanked the area's law enforcement authorities for their \"strangeness and pursuit of justice\".
Sims was only 20 years old.
The attacking growth of 6 feet grew into Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the Louisiana University team.
He averaged 5.6 points last season, 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, Louisiana University basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was \"emptied\" and \"in shock\" from Wade's death.
\"This is something I always worry about,\" Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash in Mexico City
The ash, which erupts at the Papacatepetl volcano, reached the southern areas of Mexico's capital city.
The National Center for Disaster Warning on Saturday suggested Mexicans were kept further from the volcano after activity was exposed in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were registered within 24 hours.
There was an audible grunt in the center and there were jolts.
Images on social networks have shown that there are fine layers of paper coating on car windscreen around Mexico City, such as Sacchimilco.
Geophysics has noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the southern-east of the capital following a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been maintaining activity since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after independence supporters clashed with public order police, and thousands of others joined the demonstration to mark the first anniversary of the polarization vote on the separation of Catalonia.
A group of separatists in masks that were restrained by police in public order, abandoned them with eggs and cracked with powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, fighting broke out when police used their duchess to restrain demonstrators.
For several hours, groups of independence strugglers who chanted \"Don't forget, don't forgive\" clashed with the unionists present, who shouted, \"Live Spain.\"
According to local press reports, fourteen people have undergone treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protest.
Tensions in the region seeking independence remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which noted separatist separatists.
Voters in the vast majority preferred independence, although the voter turnout was low, which was largely explained by a boycott of the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, last summer nearly 1,000 people were injured after police attempted to stop voting at polling stations across the region as a result of the actions of angry demonstrators.
Groups advocating independence spent the night of Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police force.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to follow the other way.
The 68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who attends the separatist protest along with his wife, said that he no longer hopes for the prospects of independence for Catalonia.
\"Flight we've been through one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy when they could vote, but now we're tired,\" he said.
Despite the vital but minor victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties advocating independence, of all forces, tried to maintain momentum this year with many of their most famous leaders and found themselves either in voluntary exile or imprisonment awaiting trial for organizing a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Jaan Puch, who records a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
\"Standing up is all tense,\" he said.
On Saturday, Ariol Junkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in SIS since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in next year's European Parliament election.
\"Selection as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regress of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,\" he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after they protruded a house on their car]
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car was repeatedly cut into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in the Bellinagard-Cresent area on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
Maybe at some point a bullet was fired into the car.
As a result of Meng's kick, Livingstone scores a 1â0 victory over Rangers.
Dolly Mengy's first goal in favour of Livingstone ensured they won
The success of Livingstone stunned the Rangers, and this hapilla to appoint Stephen Gerard after his several defeats in 18 games to be Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Mengyi's impact was great because Gary Holt rose to one level with Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team will not win at the Premier League exit this season and will meet with leaders next Sunday, the Harts team are behind by eight points.
Prior to this, Rangers in the Europa League take on Thursday Vienna's Rapid.
Livingstone, meanwhile, continued their winless streak in the division to six games, and head coach Holt still feels a setback after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
\"Livingston misses chances due to rough visitors\"
Holt's team had to get ahead long before they scored, but so was the direction of the challenges to the Rangers for a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but lost his chance to kill in the gate, after which Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his effort wider to meet Craig Halkett's kick.
The landlords were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could bother the guests at some point.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
A penalty kick was allowed from the Rangers side, and Livingstone worked off his debut, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to overtake Meng, who made a pass and scored from the centre of the field.
By this point, the Rangers dominated, but it was found that the team's defense was unsuitable, and goalkeeper Liam Callie was virtually uninvolved
So it went on in the second half, though Alfredo Marellas really saved Callie.
A ball from Scott Pitman was deflected by Rangers goalkeeper Alan Macgregor, and Lithgow far away from the second-set of Livingstone.
Balls were constantly hit in the Livingstone gate and were repelled, while two penalty demands, after being called up by Hulkett to replace Glen Middleton, and a requirement for a penalty for the game by hand, were rejected.
\"Phenomen\" from Livingstone - Analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Allesdair Lamant at Arena Tony Macaroni
Phenomenal productivity and results for Livingstone.
For men they were wonderful, continuing to transcend expectations on this rising trajectory.
Their playing style and composition have virtually not changed since their return to higher echelon, but should be given proper to Holt for how he has stimulated the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett was grand, building up a well-organized defence, while Meng was held by Connor Goldson and Joe Waral everywhere in the field.
Rangers lacked inspiration.
Whatever good they were at Gerard, they did not meet these standards.
In the last match, the ball they didn't own, only killing once at the gate, which was something like a disturbing call for Rangers, who ended up in the middle of the list.
Mixed treatment of Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, smiles were seen and groundless flying was felt when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations between NATO allies.
They quarreled over human rights problems, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EC.
Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
This city is home to the largest number of Turkish populations outside Turkey.
Police were sent to security grounds not to give a crowd of 25,000 to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters were gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protests for and against reflect differences about the guest whom one German Turks declared a hero and others condemned as an autocratic.
DTZ in Deptford: The Ravarist died when he collided with a car]
The Ravarist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a lively road in Deptford, in the southeast of the town, at approximately 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped, the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred a few months after another gunman died as the result of a collision at Childers Street, about a mile away from the site of a Saturday accident.
Standing police said that their employees were working to acquaint the man and report him to his closest relatives.
Near that site are road gardens and bus stops, and motorists were recommended to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six employees injured during riots
\"Six prison servicemen have been injured as a result of riots in a strict regime prison for men,\" the Penitentiary Authority reports.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and continue until now.
To combat the riots in which the eight prisoners placed in one wing were involved, a special group called the Tornados was brought in.
At the scene, staff underwent treatment for minor injuries.
A spokesperson for the Penitentiary Service said, \"Specially trained prison personnel were directed to combat those who committed unrest in Long Lartin Prison.
Six employees underwent treatment after receiving their injuries.
We will not erase violence in our prisons, and we realize that the guilty will be handed over to the police and can spend more time behind the grate.\"
The Long Lartin royal prison contains over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was undergoing treatment at the hospital after the prisoner was attacked.
And in October last year, public order police officers were called to prison to deal with serious riots during which staff were attacked with waterpolo swords.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with severe flooding (which may be on useful for dry regions)
Tropical hurricanes are rarely found in Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen early next week, because there are remains traces of Hurricane Rosa in the southwestern part of the desert that form the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already published data on sudden flooding in western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching with rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only \"ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or drop in pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967 film) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona state border.\"
The latest model of the National Hurricanes Center forecasts rainfall to fall from 2 to 4 inches, with levels in individual locations can reach 6 inches in the Magalion area of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert's south-west, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, it will likely fall between 1 and 2 inches, with individual resulting values can be as high as 4 inches.
For those outside the risk limits of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa could be long-awaited because their region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls are likely to be beneficial because droughts are currently being observed in the southwest.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Agency, at least a little over 40 percent of Arizona's territory is experiencing a second-category emergency drought,\" Weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rose's path leads to swells on Mexico's Lower California half-way.
On Sunday morning, Rose still had the power of a hurricane with maximum wind of 85 miles per hour 385 miles south of Punta Euchenia in Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore stilt.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm comes, there will be a river exit from the shores during the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Precipitation in various parts of Mexico may be strong, which will create a significant risk of flooding.
\"There is a total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sanlra, where there are possible rainfalls of up to 10 inches,\" Weather.com reports.
The Rose would then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical pressure drop, which would then continue to traffic through Arizona and the southern part of the state of Utah until Tuesday evening.
\"The main danger is expected from \"Rose\" or its remnants, it is very heavy rain in Lower California and on the northwestern Sanora and Southwestern Desert of the United States,\" the National Hurricane Center reported.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening and sudden flooding and silt flows and swells in the mountainous area.
Attack in Midsummer Norton: Four attempts to arrest murderers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old guy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with multiple knife wounds in Sameerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Terrace Excelsior area of Midsamer Norton around 4pm on Saturday.
He was delivered to the hospital, where he remains in a \"stable\" condition.
\"The 17-year-old guy and both others, 18 and 20 years old, were arrested at night in the Redstock, Eyvon and Sameerset area,\" the police told.
Police contacted anyone who could have any evidence on a mobile phone of what happened to move on in their search.
\"Cavano is abusing the Democratic Party's underpants and anger,\" said Trump.
\"The voice behind Judge Kavanaugh is the voice for abolishing the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous tactics,\" Trump reported on the rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh was \"pushing from the underpinning and anger\" of the Democratic Party in the course of his selection process for the post.
Kavanaugh gave indications before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that he sexually raped her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave indications during hearings about her accusation.
On Saturday, the President said that \"on this day, Americans saw a brilliant, qualitative and courageous character\" by Kavanaugh.
\"The voice in support of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice for one of the most perfect experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer with an excellent history of public service,\" he said to a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president was indirectly contrived to select Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of the Republican's ovation during the intermediate election period.
\"Five weeks are left to one of the most major elections of our time.
I'm not just late, but really late,\" he replied.
\"Here's why I fight everywhere for big candidates\".
Trump is disreputable that Democrats intend to \"contradict and impede.\"
\"It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the senate level on Kavanawo's selection will take place no later than Friday,\" CNN reported a senior parliamentary assistant leadership.
Hundreds of people died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of victims is rising
\"At least 384 people have died, many people have disappeared as a result of the influx of giant waves on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami started on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi,\" said authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on a beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of six metres (18 feet) fought ashore in twilight, killing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
A 7.5 tsunami struck the earthquake.
\"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, and they became victims,\" said press secretary for the Indonesian Disaster Eradication Agency, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, at a briefing in Jakarta.
\"Tsunami pulled cars, logs, houses, hitting everything about the ground,\" said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami went through the open sea at 800 km /hr (up to 497 miles /hr) before hitting the shoreline.
According to him, some people survived only because they were climbing trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 downtown Palu.
Aerial photos published by the natural disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops were demolished, bridges rotated and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
The following spurs continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday is about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow cove, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroha called the damage \"wide\" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were demolished.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found beneath the wreckage of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing without news.
\"The victims and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala that is closer to the earthquake epicenter,\" said Nugroha.
The connection in Dongala \"was completely damaged,\" --deployed Nugroha.
\"There are over 300,000 people living,\" said a statement from the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were deployed to the affected areas.
\"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse,\" he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely disclosed for not reporting a tsunami to Pal, but officials state that waves came at the time the warning was made.
In amateur pictures published on social networks, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building with despair cries out to people on the street warning of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water had fallen ashore, delaying buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the validity of the material removed.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power blackout that disrupted communications around Pal, so it was difficult for authorities to reconcile rescue activities.
According to authorities, the military began directing cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated food and other items of first necessity are still very much needed.
The city's airport was only open to aid and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vida planned to visit evacuation centers in Palo.
Indonesia's tsunami resulted in losses of over 800
It's really bad.
\"while World Vision employees from Danggala successfully made their way to the city of Palu, where workers are hiding in the briscent hideouts set up in the yard of their office, along the way they saw scenes of devastation,\" Mr Dosseb said.
\"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,\" he rapped.
It's really bad.
Even when relief groups began grim actions to launch aid mechanisms in disasters, some complained that foreign workers who possess deep knowledge were preventing them from going to Palo.
According to Indonesian rule, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to proceed if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
\"This is still a disaster at the provincial level,\" said Auliya Arriani, press secretary for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government declares, \"Okay, this is a national disaster,\" we will be able to open for international aid, but that status is not yet available.
On the second night in Palu, following Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of missing news-free victims hoped that their loved ones were miraculous to be among those who would leave joyless storylines of tedious disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was released from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who was under ruins for two days, and next to her, she had the body of her child.
Hendon Subandona, coach of the Indonesian national paraplanerism team, prepared two of the missing paraplanes for the Asian Games, which were completed early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were in a trap at the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
\"Being older in the field of paraplanerism I have my own emotional burden,\" he said.
Mr Hendon recounted how, within hours of news spread among a community of paraplannerists about the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp to Palu participants who were at a beach festival.
His messages were nevertheless marked with one gray holocaust rather than two blue ones.
\"It means that the messages have not been delivered,\" he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while filling the Bankmates in Newport at Levy's
\"In the morning on Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was laying bills at a bankmate in Newport on Livy,\" reported in a press release by the Newport Police Department.
\"The driver of the machine has ravaged the bankmate in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money,\" Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was busy, another man \"run out because of Brink's worker\" and stole the fur with the money intended for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses noticed several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not clarify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their individuals should contact Newport Police by telephone 859-292-3680.
Keiny West: Rapper changes his name to Ye (\"you\").
Rapper Kaney West (Kanye West) changes her name to Ye.
Having announced a name change in Twitari on Saturday, he wrote: Appearing officially known as Keiny West.
West, who is 41 years old, named Ye, used this nickname as the name for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes take place on the eve of his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande with a show that cancelled for \"emotional reasons,\" said the show's creator.
Much like the reduction of his current professional name West used to say that the word has religious significance for it.
I believe that \"ye\" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is \"you,\" West said early this year, discussing the album's title with radio-lead Big Boy.
That's the way, I'm - that's you, I'm - that's us, all of it - we're
It came from \"Kainy\" which means \"the only one\", to just Ye . . . a reflection of our good, our bad, our debauchery, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs was variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he was leaning towards the Love and Brother Love names.
West's former employee, Jay-Zie, also went unconnected and headlined.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use army against civilians\"
Mexican electoral president AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civil population as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a day of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, at the Tlatelolco Plaza Square, LÃ³pez Obrador pledged \"never to use the Wairs to subdue the Mexican people\".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration in the area that killed about 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were rooted throughout Latin America.
LÃ³pez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly subsidies to those studying, thus opening up more free places in state universities.
\"Beware and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups,\" he said.
US should double funding for machine intelligence\"
\"As China becomes increasingly active in the area of machine intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on research in this field,\" says investor and machine intel specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about MI, even if the U.S. lacks an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: by 2030 it is trying to be the first in the field of MI innovation.
\"The filing of the budget for research in the MI area would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the United States, and we expect the next breakthrough in the MI area,\" Lee said.
\"Understanding funding may double the likelihood that the next major M.I. achievement will get in the U.S.\" said Lee on CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book, Withdraws of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order, was published in this month by Howton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive of Sinavation Ventures, a company that invested in one of MI's most famous companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie-Melana University he worked on a machine intelligence system that beat the highest-ranking American Atella player, and later he was head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese department in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's robotics competition for a forward research project in the field of defense, and asked if it would be next to help define the next visionaries.
\"U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government grants,\" Lee reported.
\"It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's corporations,\" Li said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities in recent years to work on MI.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the United States consolidate its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
\"In my opinion, green cards should be automatically offered to MI field candidates,\" he said.
The State Council of China released a plan in July 2017 to develop the next generation machine intelligence.
\"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,\" Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Machine Intelligence, in which partners from industry and science circles are to participate, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Machine Intellect.
And this month, the Defense Agency's forward research project announced a $2 billion investment called AI Next.
As far as the National Science Organization (NSF) is concerned, it is currently injecting over $100 million a year into MI's research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation, which sought to create the National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence, did not monitor the actions for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on changing their name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\", which would allow for a ten-year dispute with Greece, which blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory, and vetoed the NATO and EC accession.
In June, the two governments concluded a deal given the proposed new name, but nationalist associates say that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter turnout would meet the minimum of 50 percent needed to hold the referendum.
The question of voting in the referendum suggests, \"You are for NATO and EC membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece.\"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a cost that should be paid for admission to such bodies as the EC and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
\"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,\" said Oliver Georgievski, aged 79, Skopje.
Although this does not have a binding legal force, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said that they will take into account the outcome of the vote to make it crucial.
The name change will require more than two-thirds in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that by 1 p.m., reports of irregularities had not proceeded.
However, the riding was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
\"I have come to vote for the sake of my children, our seat is - in Europe,\" said 62-year-old voter in the capital of Skopje, Jose Tanevski.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zaritza and his son DuÅ¡ka voted for a referendum in Macedonia dedicated to changing the name of the country which will open the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje Vladimir Kawardarkov, age 54, he prepared a small scene and plotted chairs in front of tents set by those who would boycott the referendum.
\"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want union with raised heads, not through service doors,\" said Kawadarkov.
\"We are a poor country, but we have pride.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can appeal to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.\"
Prime Minister Zaev said that friendships in NATO will bring necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
\"I believe the overwhelming number will be 'for' because more than 80 percent of our citizens support EC and NATO,\" Zaev said after the vote.
He said the result of \"yes\" would be \"confirming our future.\"
In a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia, it is said that the referendum will take between 30 and 43 percent of voters' participation, which is lower than the required ovation.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia TV showed 57 percent of those polled planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they voted \"yes\".
For a successful referendum, the ivy must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure in the referendum will be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguera of Manchester City passes to the gates through the entire Brighton defence
On Saturday, Sergio Aguera and Rahim Sterling tackled the defence problem against Brighton in a 2â0 victory for Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
On the 65th minute, Aguerre made it easy.
The Argentine attacking got a pass in the center of the field.
He was rushing between three Brighton defenders before hitting an open field.
Then Aguerra ended up among the four green shirts.
He tackled one defender and overtook several more at the edge of the Brighton field.
He then pushed a pass to the left flank, finding Sterling.
England attacking the first touchdown in a penalty gave the ball to Aguerre, who used his right kick to tackle Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a kick into the right of the net.
\"Aguera has some foot problems,\" said journalist manager of the city of Pep Guardiola.
\"We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were fortunate to have scored a goal at that very moment.\"
But it was Sirling who gave Skye Blues the initial advantage in the fight in the Premier League.
This goal took place on the 29th minute.
Aguera received this ball in the depths of the Brighton territory.
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Lerua Sane.
Seine made a few touches before Sterling was able to reach the distance of the stinger.
Attacking the Sky Blues headed the ball into the net before he jumped abroad.

Scherzer wants to play the \"gathering point\" role against Rocky]
After the Nationals were excluded from competition in the playoffs, there was no particular reason to forge a new start.
But the constantly competitive Scherzer hopes to take a hit on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only when there will still be the consequences of the playoffs for Rocky, who remain in the leaders after one game with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the North West.
The Rookies won, at least, a unambiguous spot with a 5â2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still hoping to get their first title in the division.
\"Even though we're playing just so, at least we can handle the situation knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team going to fold so that the game will probably be at the highest level out of all I've faced this year.
Why don't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have yet to announce a start for Sunday, but they are reported to be inclined to give Scherzer the ball in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was about to make his 34th start, held a CCD session on Thursday and will be on Sunday at normal rest.

Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president has been indirectly contrived on the situation surrounding his selection of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of the Iowa Republicans in the interim elections.
\"All we've done is at risk in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most major elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big . . . I'm not late, but really late, so I fight everywhere for the big candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued, \"You see this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, see that it's happening right now.
And they are full of determination to regain power themselves, using any necessary means, you see, â vileness, mersotto.
They don't care who they deplore, whom they have to beat to gain power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control that we're not going to give them away.\"
In his words, the Democrats intend to \"contrary and impede\".
\"And you see it in the last four days, ,\" he said, calling the Democrats \"bad, undercooked, backwards and lying.\"
He was sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee to still recognize Democratic group senator Diana Feinstein, who received a loud assessment from the audience.
\"Remember her answer?
Do you allow the document leak?
Uh, what.
No, I don't expect to â it was a very bad non-verbal language  â the worst language I've ever seen.\"
The work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It is intolerance to those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to get me injured, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am - the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party - to whom we are told that we are not welcome  - all to express our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar appeal because she was decisively opposed to antisemitism.
In my case, censorship disclosed me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the irony of fate similar questions to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a report on the meeting, which was righteous on Friday by the Nottingham East Labour Party, it is said that \"we want these meetings to be sweeping and productive.\"
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Labour Party, it was such meetings that were on Friday
Unfortunately, today at most meetings the tone is not so and the promise of a \"more good, more mild\" policy has long since been forgotten, if indeed ever it has been.
It becomes increasingly evident that in the Labour Party different views are not allowed, and every opinion is judged on the part of view, is it acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously believed that sharing the same political views had begun to expect me to make a step back, and had taken up positions that I would in no way mention--in national security issues or on a single EU market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's a tirade insult on social networks calling for election cancellation, condemning the center's policies, saying I'm no longer on the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I have been lucky more than some of my colleagues because comments aimed at me tend to be political.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the flow of sexual or racist deals every day, but never evade.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
Reality is such that we are no longer an organization that holds different views, and with every movement of \"uncertainty\" or a change in the rules of selection the party becomes narrower.
For the last two years I have been given a lot of advice that has urged me not to fall in spirit, not to be so loud, and then with me everything will be okay.
But that's not what I went into politics for the sake.
Ever since I joined the Labourists 32 years ago as a school student provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which is why my schooling failed, I have sought to stand up for the best public services for those in their most need of the â let it be a local resident or government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, including in past elections.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be entangled in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would say that when the country is headed for Brexit, which carries damage to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and strength on my allegiance to the Labour Party leaders.
But in fact, the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it is my electorate, whether it be Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and promise that no threat of electoral abolition will be made and political feasibility will prevent me from acting in the interest of you all.

Air Melrose 38 - 17: Invincible Ayr on top
Two late attempts may have distorted the end result somewhat, but no doubt Eyre earned a triumph in this remarkably interesting Tennant Premier League match.
They now head the tournament table, the only side of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, just like their best chances, which made them masters, coach Peter Murchy the dead had the full right to be satisfied.
\"We've still tried our games so far and we're still invincible, so I should be happy,\" he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: Give up the proper Aira, he dared more than we.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute try, converted by Fraser Klim, put Ayr in the foreground, but a yellow card for the Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to juggle the numbers, and Jason Baggot grabbed for an unfulfilled try.
Klimov stretched Eyre's lead with a penalty shootout before, just in the break, he scored and then put up a solo try, making 17-5 to Eyre in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and a Patrick Anderson try converted by Bagot reduced the score to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, which was stretched, and after the re-launch, Air advanced further through a attempt by Stafford Macdawell, a implemented Klims.
Air, while serving as Captain Blair McPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another man to pay with an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin in late February pressure.
However, the stewards returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for kicking Klims without a ball out of the penalty line, Macpherson landed behind Eyre.
Klimov realised his attempt, which he made again almost after the re-start, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's kick into the penalty and sent flanker Gregor Henry on a fifth attempt by the field stewards.
Still Game star, like, ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, the game's star Ford Kieran is about to enter the hotel business industry after it turns out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he writes, and is filmed with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the next ninth series would be the last in the show's series, and it seems Kernan plans to operate further after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of the Scottish Sun hinted that Kernan hoped to take part in \"a prosperous trade in Glasgow\".
Our Sea: Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, hopes the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the numbered motto \"The Sea of Ours is Right\".
To recover is our duty.
In all of Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in bloody conflict due to the resources of the 19th century is still alive - like the urge to sail through the Pacific again.
These hopes may have reached the maximum summit over the past decade, as Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision for October 1 after five years of discussion.
\"Bolivia has the impulse, the spirit of unity and calm, and of course it expects a positive result,\" Bolivian diplomat Raberta Calsadilla said.
Numerous Bolivians will monitor the IS decision on large screens across the country, hoping that a tribunal in The Hague, after decades of tense talks, will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is committed to negotiating Bolivia's grant of sovereign leave to sea.
Eva Morales is Bolivia's charismatic president who faces a conflicting fight for re-election next year.
\"We are very close to returning to the Pacific,\" he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make the decision in favor of Bolivia, and that it will change little even if he does.
The UN-based organization in the Netherlands is not entitled to make a decision on the territory of Chile and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the International Court of Justice ruling goes out only six months after the final arguments were considered, testifies that the case \"was not complex,\" said Chilean expert in international law field Paz Zarate.
And far from advancing Bolivia's affairs, the last four years may have thrown her back.
\"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration,\" Sarat said.
According to her, the militant rhetoric Morales lost the remaining Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but then hold discussions will be very difficult.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Radriges Veltze, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that making the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia \"an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile\" and the opportunity to \"put an end to 139 years of differences with mutual gain,\" he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Morales -- still one of Latin America's most popular presidents --used the maritime problem as a political stronghold.
\"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,\" he added.
\"The ordinance is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.\"
North Korea declares that nuclear disarmament will not come until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfill promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders.
His comments come as US. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is like being on the verge of restoring nuclear deadlock diplomacy to North Korean Kim Cheng Yin more than three months after Singapore .
Rhee says it is an \"unsanitary dream\" to have continued sanctions and U.S. objections against the declaration of an end to the war in Korea ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration if Pyongyang will not launch significant steps to disarm at first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are demanding a second summit.
But there is a great skepticism about what Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp summit.
At Paris fashion shows we saw the newest line in massive headsets on our way to shops in your cities
If you want to increase your collection of hats or close the sun completely, you can no longer look for it.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented many unusual headsets on the podium for their SS19 collection, which crossed the wait from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram conquered the popularity of impractical hats whose designers sent their creations to the podium.
Valentino's prominent feature was a luxurious beige hat decorated with wide fields similar to feathers that filled the heads of models.
Other accessories of unusually large size included decorated caving jewels, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples, but they were not intended to keep their heads warm.
Tim Brown also showed a compilation of wise-cracked masks - just before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks were with stitched lips and more resembled Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of them resembled a redoubt for underwater swimming with tubing and protective glasses, and another a--like molten ice cream cone.
And if you keep sticking strongly to huge fashion attributes, you're lucky.
Those who follow the style predict that huge hats can break into our everyday lives.
The hats of huge size follow the heels to \"La Bomba\", a straw hat with fields two feet wide that can be seen in all, from Riana to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label on a very awkward hat, which was dissolved in social networks, contributed to another big face on the podium - a straw beach torbu, almost as big as a model with this torba dressed in a bathtub.
The dark orange torba of the rafia, decorated with a rafika and covered in white leather handle, became an outstanding part in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Fashion Week in Paris.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitidge said to the F.C., \"I expect to see big hats and beach torsions on the main streets the following summer, as the designer had a major impact, and it would be difficult to ignore the demand for non-gabarite accessories.\"
John Edward: Knowing languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
Independent Schools Scotland maintains achievements in academic success, this has been ongoing since 2018 with another excellent result of examinations that underpin individual and collective success in sport, arts, music and other community beginnings.
Over 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are looking to provide better levels of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers and their places as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can develop and inculcate an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to remain a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, \"If you speak to a man in a language he understands it remains in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.\"
It's a vivid reminder that we can't only hope for English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of this year's latest exams, we see languages taking first places in league tables with the highest enrollment rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
Data collected in 74 SCIS participating schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher Class A in Chinese language learning, while 72 percent were those studying German, 69 percent were French, and 63 percent were Spanish, also reached A level.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that are undoubtedly needed by children and young people in the future.
The languages as a subject are now chosen just like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that among the reasons employers brought in due to the difficulty in filling vacancies, 17 percent were associated with a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills become necessary to prepare young people for a future career.
Given the more promising jobs that language knowledge requires, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
No matter who profession abeys, if you learn another language, in the future it will become a real advantage if you possess such skills for life.
The ability to contact people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person first among competitors.
According to a YouGov poll, which was attended by over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent failed to speak foreign well enough to lead the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of - 15 percent.
That's why investing in language is now important to modern children.
The presence of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more chance to find a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be distinguished by the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to the UK when looking at the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, in independent schools there will always be a choice from a few languages with a teaching staff that are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools seek to provide an environment of learning that will prepare children and arm them with the skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of what will be in the future.
It cannot now be denied that in the global business environment language is still vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as \"the skills of international communication\".
Independent schools will also continue to offer this choice, diversity and preference for Scottish youth.
It must be done
John Edward - Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron debuts on Sunday in San Diego
Start waiting for fans who want to see Lebron James make his first start at--Los Angeles Lakers--
Coach-Leicesters - Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's pre-season opener against the Denver Nagets - in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's going to play, you still have to determine.
\"It will be more of one and less of 48,\" said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell wrote that James would likely play in the limited minutes.
According to the practice that occurred this week. James asked about his plans for \"six game pre-season schedules\".
\"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,\" he said.
Trump's performance time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins a multitude of campaign shares.
This is the first of five planned Trump speeches next week, including stops at friendly locations, Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote being confirmed upon arrival for the election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump seeks to strengthen the support of having an interim election take place, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's performance starting tonight in West Virginia and how do you look at it on the internet?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET night, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view Trump's West Virginia performance on the internet below live on YouTube.
Trump is most likely this week to consider hearings on the candidacy for the Supreme Court's Brett Kavanaugh, who has problems over accusations of sexual harassment with the expected Senate vote confirmation this week during an FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speakers is to provide assistance to Republicans who are standing before the November election.
So President Trump's campaign announced that these five spoke next week aimed to \"activate the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,\" Reuters reports.
\"Controlling Congress is so important for its order of the day that the president will go to a maximum possible number of states, as we are entering a tense season of pre-election campaign,\" said Reuters agency spokesman for the Trump campaign.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today's action may attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from the Pitsburg media,\" reported The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be second together in the last month when Trump visited West Virginia, a state in which he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the polls.
\"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try to give him a push in the polls,\" said Simon Hedar, a political scientist at West Virginia University, reports Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA advances to fight to keep hopes of life on Sunday
After the three one-sided sessions of Saturday's four, it may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed for this.
The pendulum impetus that swings out is an entirely invented sporting concept that players honestly believe in, and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where would they say the pulse now?
\"They had a six point advantage, and now it's four, so I think we're going through this with a little momentum,\" said Jordan Spite, spacing for the day.
Europe's advantage is of course four points forward, and there are twelve more points in the game.
The Americans, says Spitch, feel they have a slightly blown wind, and they have something to hope for, not least because of the shape of Spaith and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day long, and each can boast three points out of four.
The spice was deadly from T-shirts to greens and is an example.
These larynx cries of celebration became all louder as his round lasted, and he sunk the decisive kick to play the match on four field as they and Thomas gave up two for two.
His kick, which allowed them to win in the match on the 15th, was met with a similar cry, like one that tells you he thinks the American team isn't off.
\"The thing is just to deepen and worry about your own match,\" said Spiti.
Already each of these players is gone.
18 holes to make the score.
Over the past two days, the only players to gain more points than Spaight and Thomas are Francesco Malinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couples in Europe are four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
\"Mollywood\" was the only couple who did not make boggies on Saturday, afternoon, but they also escaped boggies on Saturday morning, Friday and afternoons on Friday.
This happens, and as their energy, like, flows to and from this tumultuous crowd, and this confirms that they are players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential victory in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Malinari.
It is preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a brief job on SÃ©rgio Garcia, the hero of the morning furchet, when he was paired with Alex Norren.
Boggs and two doppelgangers on the front nine ripped the Spanish and Swede to him, with whom they were never able to climb out.
On Sunday, nevertheless, no one will be able to help you with your bow.
The matches of the four balls and fours are so interesting to observe closely because of the interaction between folding the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not perform, and the way the strategy can change in one instant.
Europe has become a better team so far and has taken on a significant role on the last day, but this fourth meeting also shows that the U.S. team seeks a fight in which some have questioned, especially the States.
Europe will enter the Ryder Cup final with a score of 10-6.
Europe will get a good advantage on Ryder's final day of the Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball matches and fours with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
An inspired duet by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Malinari marked the fight with two wins over Tyger Woods to lead the results in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in an effort to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, reigned in the American agency of discontent in the morning, gaining the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in a four-ball match, winning two games, but they were unable to do more.
In order to keep the trophy, Jim Furrick's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 single games.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row, and he and Malinari to be named Molliwood after sensational outfields, - this is only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
Breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they miraculously braced to beat the devastated Woods and American recruit Bryson DeCambo by another 5 and 4.
Woods, who held himself through two matches on Saturday, showed an occasional burst of brilliance, but he now lost 19 of 29 times in four-ball and four-wicket matches and seven in a row.
Justin Rouse, rested on a four-ball match, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in four-ball matches to forfeit 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - taking one and second place in the world.
Europe had no way of its own, although it was a pleasant, fresh day south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time lead winner Jordan Spaight and Justin Thomas set a checkpoint for the Americans by two points.
They earned wins 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter of Spain in four ball matches and returned later to beat Puller and Rory Macilroy 4 and 3 in fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team came back from a four-point deficit going alone, although it only takes Furic's owners to draw to keep the trophy.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counter-attack on Sunday looks as if they have everything to get.
North Korea says \"no way\" will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said that on Saturday, the United Nations continues sanctions that boost distrust of the United States, and under such conditions the country cannot abandon nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yun Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the world body that last year North Korea has adopted \"significant measures of goodwill\", such as stopping tests at nuclear and missile sites, dismantling the nuclear testing area, and vowing not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
\"The sign we don't see an appropriate response from the United States,\" he said.
\"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way in the first place unilaterally disarming ourselves.\"
Despite Ri re-publishing the usual North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a \"poetap\" approach to dinuclearization, within which North Korea was rewarded as it took gradual steps, its statement proved significant in the fact that it did not deny the unilateral announcement of deuklearization, which was made by Pyongyang in the past.
Ri was sent to a joint statement by Kim Cheng Yin and Donald Trump at the first-ever U.S. presidential and North Korean leader summit in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work on his way to \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\", with Trump promising to give guarantees to North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53, but the United States said Pyongyang should first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to abolish strict international sanctions on North Korea.
\"The United States of America first insists on \"denucleration\" and increasing pressure levels using sanctions to achieve its goal in a compelling way, and even opposes \"announcement of the end of the war,\" says Ri.
\"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an inexorable dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepens our distrust.\"
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the head of the United States noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Je-in over the past five months and added, \"If participants in this issue of denuclearization were South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not become such a deadlock.\"
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed sharply from last year, when he spoke to the UN General Assembly claiming that targeting the U.S. continent using North Korea's missiles was imminent after President Evil's \"Mr. President\" Trump called Kim a \"missile\" suicide.
This year at UN Trump, who last year threatened to \"kiss to destroy\" North Korea, praised Kim for his boldness in making disarmament measures, but said that there would still be a lot to be done, and sanctions should remain in effect until that couple while North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump reported that he did not have a time frame for this, saying, \"If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter.\"
China and Russia are arguing in the UN. The Security Council has said that it is worth rewarding Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that \"The execution of Security Council sanctions should be active and definitely continued until we make sure of full, final and validated dinuclearization.\"
The Security Council increased sanctions on North Korea in 2006 by trying to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the Security Council coluars. the General Assembly then stated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress made with North Korea within hours of talks had been finalized by a visa application that he was alleging demands \"likely on the gangstas\".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to eliminate the missile facility and the nuclear complex if the United States takes \"appropriate measures\".
Trump said that by Kim's words, \"the appropriate measures\" he expects are security guarantees and efforts to normalize relations with Washington, D.C., which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students take a course on the correct vacation.
Harvard University's new course this year must teach students more sleep, and has the goal of fighting culture to learn at night with coffee in hand.
A scientist concluded that students at one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to look after themselves properly and their health.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, developed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by a speech about the impact of a lack of sleep on learning, he began his course.
At the end of the lecture, one girl approached me and said, \"Why did I just say it right now, at the last course of study?\"
\"She said no one and never told her about the importance of sleep - it surprised me,\" he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, a course set out by a student explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting achievement, as well as improving the overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's Health Service, told the university he decided to enter the course after finding that students were often sleep-free this week.
The course, which lasts an hour, includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a room in the internet where students click cups with coffee, curtains, and books that tell the impact of the cafÃ© and light and how lack of sleep impacts sports indicators as well as the importance of habits before sleep.
At the nastipated stage, participants tell how perennial sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive images, urges participants to think about their daily lives.
\"We know this will instantly not change student behavior.
But we believe they have to know it as much as everyone knows about the consequences of smoking for health,\" added Professor Chaseler.
According to him, the culture of night dinners still exists, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students leads to sleep deprivation, which proves to be an increasing problem.
\"Endangered sufficient sleep of good quality must be a 'secret weapon' of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, Â» he said, Â» even to avoid excess weight, since sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry.\"
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, assisted Professor Chaseler in developing the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to wake everyone up on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for ussirants to complete a similar curriculum before entering the university.
Professor Chaseler recommended that students be able to set a watch to know when to go to bed and when to wake up, aware of the harmful consequences of the \"blue light\" radiating from monitor screens and LED lighting that can change the day's mode, leading to problems with instigation.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: Mengo kills Gerard's goal.
The Rangers suffered another setback when Dolly Mangy's goal assured that Stephen Gerard would not get a 1-0 defeat at Livingstone Stadium.
Aibrax wants to record his first win on the way to a 4â1 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holton's team already carries a second defeat of Gerard as manager of 18 games to leave eight points on their side, away from Premier Ladbrokes Hearts leaders.
Meng hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, did not look as if they were rubbing the collapse.
At the same time as the Rangers drop to sixth place, Livingstone rose to third place, behind remain Hibernian with the ball difference.
Additional problems may occur for the Sooners after forward Callum Spence is due to be treated from a head injury after he has a falling item thrown from the stands.
Gerard made eight player changes, causing Ayr to not play in the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livy at number 11, which allowed him to pick up a point from Hearts last week, and was in awe of how they were good at each step bypassing their opponents.
Rangers were more ball possession, but Livingstone made more attempts to kill the ball.
They had to kill just two minutes later when the first time Mengy headed the ball through Scott Pitman to the gates of Alan Macgregor, and then the halfback used that chance.
A successful penalty kick by Jacobs Keegan sealed off Craig Hulkett's sack, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow was able to strike a strong back kick.
The Rangers seized control, but in the last third of the game, they were more hoping to kill than demonstrated a good game.
Alfredo Marellas certainly had to be penalized a quarter of an hour before the end, when he and Stephen Lawless faced off in the field, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept Columbia's complaints.
The Rangers only managed to hit the gate in the first half of the game, but former Aibrocks goalkeeper Liam Callie nearly gave away a goal to Lasan Coulibaly and effective tackle Ovi Ehiria.
Although scored the first goal on the 34th minute, Livy may have been against a further active game, but no one denies that they had to demonstrate the buzzer a good game.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to break out the Jacobs' gate.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Meng to gain the opportunity to kill in the gate.
Gerard replaced Coulibaly at Ryan Kent in the break, and this had an effective effect when the assault broke through to Marelas, but an impressive Caley ran in and blocked the kick.
But Livingstone continued to please the visitors, playing that game, which was exactly what they liked, and Lithgow and Hulkett continued to share the ball after a long standoff.
Holt's side was only able to prevail on the final minutes, but Macgregor played well to counter Jeikabs before Lithgow went on the reserve bench.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, happened once again following a penalty penalty penalty when he faced the Jacobs, but Thomson managed to evade.
Almanack: Inventor of Geiger's counter.
Page from our Almanac 'Sunday Morning': September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLICI...the day of future physicist Ian Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which resulted in the appearance of a device known as a Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter became part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Call of the Root, which featured those seemingly little-known scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers:-It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you overlay your headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms that are given to radioactivity in minerals -
Evans: \"Say it really shakes right now\"?!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system to \"see\" cancer cells.
A new anti-missile vaccine can help the immune system to \"see\" bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine is as if it were teaching the immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method implies getting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
Cells can then \"see\" the protein distributed in many cancer cells and then re-introduce auxiliary cells.
A trial vaccine demonstrates successful outcomes for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was introduced a vaccine to help the immune system recognize cancer cells saw egg cancer disappear within 18 months.
The method involves getting immune cells in the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can \"see\" the HER2 protein common to many cancer cells, and then reintroduced.
This was said by Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethes State of Maryland.Our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
\"HER2 stimulates the growth of several kinds of anti-river cells fighting the cancer of the small gland, the herons, the lungs and the colon,\" Professor Berazofsky told the press.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and \"learning\" them to reach cancer cells worked well in treating leukosis.
Kanye West embarked on a debate in support of Trump, carrying the IAEA title, following his appearance in the SNL.
That didn't turn out well.
In the studio during Saturday evening's evening, Kanye West was disheartened after a performance where he waves to the United States. President Donald Trump said he would be chatting for a second term in 2020.
After performing in the evening of his third song, titled \"City Ghost\", when he was in the cap of \"Let America Do Big Again\", he spoke out against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
\"How many times do I talk to white people, and they said, How can you support Trump, he's a racist?\"
\"Well, if I bothered because of racism, I would have left America a long time ago,\" he said.
SNL began a show featuring the lead role of Matt Damon, where Hollywood star starred over the screenings of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee while dealing with Christine Blasey Ford's sexual violence case.
Despite the fact that the performance was not broadcast, West's words fell into the footage and were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock tried to deal with West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a difficult time behind the bullets.
They bullied over a lot behind the bullets.
They said, \"Don't get out there with this bad thing.
They bullied themselves abode me.
\"And then they say I'm in a giblet place,\" he said, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
West continued: Wants to see a hilarious place? \"Speaking he\" would put on my scppermen's cap, which meant he couldn't tell me what to do. you want the world to go forward?
Try to love.
Due to his statements at least twice, hearings were dropped, and SNS representatives were embarrassed by the message from Weraiti. \"the whole studio silenced.\"
West was adopted as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many of the performance of the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of water by Perrier.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA party, Kendes Turner, who wrote in a tweet, \"One of the bravest spirits Thank You for your support.\"
But leading talk show Karen Hunter wrote that West is just who he is, and it's always wonderful.
\"But I have decided NOT to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his 'art', which I believe embraces and distorts an ideology that does harm to my community.
He's free.
Just like us,\" she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now \"officially called Cayney West\".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and went in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Diddy.
His colleague rapper Snoop Dogg has been called the colics of Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of the music that changed his name to a symbol and then still he and the artist formerly known as Prince.

Keith Harrington's Game of Thrones star garnered idealized brutality.
Keith Harington is known for his swinging sword and John Snow's role in the series \"The Game of Pristoles\" in the HBO mid-morning crude battlecruiser
But the 31-year-old actor got the stereotype of the hero macho, which means that young boys often feel tougher to respect.
Speaking in the culture department of the Sunday Times, Keith said he believes \"something has happened\" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who had recently married his roommate on the Game of Thrones, Rouse Leslie, who was also 31 years old, admitted to feeling power in himself over the handling of this problem.
\"I feel personally a strong guy - when have we wronged courage?\" he said.
\"Why do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the attitude we see now?\"
Keith believes television should be responsible for the advent of brutality due to very male characters.
He continued, \"What lies in the beginning and why teach that?\"
Why teach on television and on the streets what makes young boys feel like they have to be so sure to be a real person?
I think that's really one of the biggest issues in our time  â how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something happens to young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that the following summer the series would end, and he would withdraw from the field of battle of the series and would not make the Duckwells or Sequels to the Game of Thrones.
From November, Keith will begin to revive True West Sam Shepherd, who is a historical director with his brother who is a slaver.
Recently, the actor behaved that he considered meeting his wife, Rose, the best opportunity to complete the Game of Thrones.
\"I met my wife in this series so I got my future family and my life here,\" he said.
Rose played the Igritte (Ygritte), a character in which Keith's hero Jon Snow falls in love in this fantasy series awarded to Amy.
The couple teamed up in June 2018 at Leslie Manor in Scotland.
HIV / AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people have contracted in the country.
For the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, as it has been in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is distributed in some areas of China as a result of infection through blood transfusions.
\"The number of such people infected with HIV infection through blood transfusions has fallen almost to zero,\" said Chinese officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, with each year, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV infection through sex is a blatant problem of China's LGBT communities.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still eating.
Due to conservative values in the country, approximately 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases spread from insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the government of China has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to solve this global problem.
Maxine Waters dismisses the downpour of the reported, the danger and conspiracy theory of her fellow parliament members
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters broke off charges on Saturday that her staff posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claim was up to members of the super-right wing and their sites.
\"Close, false, and much abhorrent lies,\" said Wotters' statement on Twitter.
Published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States. meaning. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on Capital Hill during Senate Commission hearings on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
\"Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source's IP address was linked to the Voters' office and distributed information to the Voters' team staff,\" Hill reports.
\"This unjustified assertion is completely false and absolutely false,\" Wotters continued.
\"Chlenn my team whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these misleading and false charges, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unjustified assertion is completely false and absolutely false.\"
Wotters' statement quickly drew criticism on the internet, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
\"This denial exudes anger,\" wrote Fleischer.
This indicates that she has no courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of not doing something they shouldn't be angry.
They don't have to lead themselves outrageously.
They should not question the motives of their accusation.
They must be calm and good-natured.
Fleischer compared Wotters' reaction to criticising Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh when they were accused of being a former too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Amar Navarro, the Republican Party candidate who is swamped and participates in meetings in the interim election, also expressed himself in Twitter.
\"It's a response when it turns out to be true,\" he wrote.
In her statement, Wotters said her office had warned the authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false statements.
\"We guarantee that the culprits will be found,\" she continued, \"and they will take legal responsibility for all of their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any of my team's employees.\"
An overview of Johnny English Strikes Against strikes the fictional spy Rowene Atkinson.
It has now become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXITU in any new film with a British bias, and this bias seems to be in the comedy and action franchise of Johnny Inglisha, which began as early as 2003 with Johnny Inglish and was prolonged in 2011 under the title \"The Rebirth of Johnny Inglish\".
Will satire be able to express itself well about how obviously brainless we look when we talk about new export opportunities?
In every case, the second time he appeared in print, the incompetent Johnny Inglish was given the opportunity to laugh over things. â his name was louder than all the comic creations he did for non-English viewers in cinematography.
Of course, he's a secret agent who, despite his wisecracking claims to glamour, got a little like Clouseau with the features of Mr Bean and a little taco guy who made a single note in the Chorus of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
His character was originally based on the journeyman and international mysteries of Atkinson, who once played the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos in his way.
There are a few nice moments here that you haven't had before.
I loved Johnny Inglish, who is approaching the helicopter, dressed in mid-stakes, and shoves a rotor a little knock down his helmet.
Atkinson's Gift for Theatre Comedy is vividly shown, but the humor is felt weakly, and so strangely special when serious films such as Agent 007: Mission Unfulfilled are sure to offer comedy as the main part.
Humor feels as if it is not only for adults, but for children as well, and even the brainless accidents of Johnny Inglisza are not as inventive as Atkinson's silent films in the face of Bean.
Years of current thoughtfulness are serious problems of the United Kingdom.
Cyber hacker infiltrated the super-secret community of British spies in the United Kingdom by discovering the names of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the duty agent - this is unfortunately a small role of Kevin Eldan.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a proud and mixed act who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this quasi-Teresai-Mei, but there is nothing so in the script.
Her intelligence consultants report that since every real spy will be exposed, she will have to engage some of those already retired.
And that means that for Johnny Inglis himself, everything becomes complicated: now he works as a sixth teacher in several slick institutions and gives lessons like being an undercover operator: some good examples here since Inglis offers Academy of Music lessons of espionage.
Inglisch returned to Whitehall for an extraneous briefing and reunited with his former longtime friend Bo, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bo now has a marriage attached to the commander of the submarine, a role which Vicky Pepperdine performed a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin get awfully wrong things at the Queen's Secret Agency, where they work again, meeting a beautiful woman named Volga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is given a dangerous order by a charismatic technical billionaire who declares that he can solve the problems with UK hackers: with the notorious Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglisch and Bow begin their equine with immediate things: disguise themselves under the waiter, set fire to a French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight smugglers aboard the luxury yacht Volta; Inglisch commits pure anarchy because he tries to use a virtual reality garnish to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All moments are stretched out for the last event, but just as nice and noisy, in which there's quite a lot of babysitting in the TV set.
Pretty good stuff.
And how with other movies about Johnny Inglis I couldn't think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being worked out to pay the British four-day work week with pay as in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party should consider a radical plan if the British only work four days a week, but they are paid for five.
The party reportedly wants enterprise managers to hand job results done as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra weekend.
It was seen that employees would enjoy three-day weekends, but would still receive the same earnings.
The source notes that the idea is consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to target the country to support workers.
The Trade Union Congress endorsed the move for the four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times magazine, \"A planned review of action will be announced by the end of the year.
This is not going to happen now, but the four-day working week is an idea that follows the views in the party and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse such an idea, the Green Party promises to spend a four-day working week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party's aspirations as a whole are not supported.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: The four-day working week is a goal not party politics, and this is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John McDonnell used a labor conference last week to express his vision of a socialist revolution in economics.
Mr McDonnell said he decided to return power from \"unfortunate directors\" and \"managers\" to utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply that the current shareholder of water resources may not get back the entire stock package because the Laybarist government may make a \"calculation\" on the basis of alleged breaches.
He also confirmed that he planned to contribute jobs to the company's boards and set up joint property funds to transfer 10 percent of his own assets to a private firm to workers who would hold annual dividends of up to Â£500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told for \"60 Minutes\" that an FBI investigator working with Kavanaugh should change his mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh was postponed to a final vote on his selection to the Supreme Court for at least a week. there is a question as to whether the findings of the Republican Senators bureau will be able to provide support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Johnny Cannedy and Lindsey Graham about \"Sense\": whether the FBI could reveal anything that could lead to change.
Kennedy proved to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
\"I mean, of course,\" said Cannedy.
\"I said, going to the court seat: I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and asked about the cause of the indictment, asking, \"Did you do it?\"
He was resolute and unequivocal.\"
Graham's vote, however, seems final.
\"I think Brett Kavanaugh decided it would be a scandalous accusation,\" he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett is determined to deny it,\" added Graham, referring to Christine Blaisy Ford.
\"And everyone she calls, couldn't believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don't see anything new.\"
What is the International Citizens Festival and what is done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the International Festival takes place in New York City: an annual music event that has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will take place at the great corner of Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concert of Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendes, as well as learn of the real purpose of the event - stopping poverty and gale by 2030.
The International Citizenship Festival, which emerged in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project against the galley of an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay the VIP ticket) visitors had to perform a number of tasks or \"do the action\", be a volunteer, write by email to the country leader, call any other act, and raise the evidence to end poverty.
But how successful has the Civic Festival been for 12 years and has it been able to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a costless concert in a real way of convincing people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of so-called \"climbism\" - people feel they are doing a good thing by signing online petitions or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, festival organisers have stated that they have recorded more than 19 million \"actions\" from their supporters seeking to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions helped push influential leaders to execute a commitment bill of over $37 billion that could affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group led 390 comments on commitments and applications worth at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or collected.
According to the group's estimates, the secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnering with investors and executives based in the UK, \"helping children develop in full,\" a promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help avoid malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from citizens.
\"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can extort the social injustice of malnutrition in history,\" said ambassadar Tracy Ulman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 shares were carried out, at which they called for food to be improved in the UK for matul and children, the government announced funding for a food aid project that reaches 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
In response to one of the frequent questions on the website \"what makes you think we can end poverty?\"
The Global Festival Answers: It'll be a long and difficult way, sometimes we'll tolerate decay and failure.
But like the great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we will gain success because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae - one of a number of Persons performing at this year's event in New York that will be hosted by Debara-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
US may use Navy to \"block\" to prevent Russian oil and gas from being exported
\"Washington may contact the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from leaving for EZ and Middle East markets,\" said U.S. Secretary Ryan Zink, reports the Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, particularly where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, are grounds for the study of new energy markets.
\"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to acquire energy just as they are in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,\" he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means of dealing with it.
\"The United States has the opportunity with the help of the Navy to assure the openness of sea routes, and when it takes, to organize a blockade so that their energy will certainly not hit the market,\" he said.
Zinke addressed participants in an event organized by Alliance Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that positions itself as \"the voice of energy consumers\" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relationships with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same.
\"The economic alternative on Iran and Russia is more or less balancing and replacing fuel,\" he said, calling Russia a \"one-sided country\" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration wants to greatly increase exports of its underlying natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, which for European consumers is a much cheaper option.
For this, Trump administration workers, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the \"incorrect\" Northern Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which according to Trump, turned Berlin into the \"half-way\" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Northern Stream 2 gas pipeline at a cost of $11 billion, which is created to back up the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is solely an economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's fierce opposition to this project is beginning in the economy and is an example of dishonest competition.
\"I think we have a single view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,\" said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The Americans received a blow in response from Germany, who reiterated their favor with the project.
The main German organization representing the industry, the Federation of German Mailists (BDI) urged the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply,\" said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Proverbs (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss her participation in the 2020 United States presidential election very seriously, says Senator from the state of Massachusetts
Senator from the state of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would be seriously considering her participation in the election for president after the interim election.
During a speech in the mayoralty of Halioka, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering his participation.
\"It's time for women to head to Washington and sort our inactive government, and I also talk about women in the highest positions,\" she stated, according to The Hill.
\"After November 6, I will very seriously consider chatting at the president.\"
During a speech in the mayoralty, Warren edged in on President Donald Trump, saying that he would \"bring the country in the wrong direction.\"
\"I'm extremely incoherent about what Trump is doing to our democracy,\" she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in her twit, Warren wrote \"of course, before the vote we need the FBI to conduct an investigation.\"
However, the results of the poll, published on Thursday, indicated that most of Warren's voters did not believe it should be chatting to the president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk/Boston Glowb University Policy Research Center, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' \"impossible\" voters said the senator should not be swamped.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Dewall Patrick, where 38 percent were for, and 48 percent were against.
Other well-known names among Democrats discussed in the wake of potential bottling in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Baiden and Senator from Vermont state Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said that he would officially make the decision by January.
At the convention in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned Trek Palin's posttraumatic syndrome
The 26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after being called into service in September.
On Monday evening he was arrested and he was charged with domestic violence
\"What my son is going through after his return, I can compare with the results of the post-Rural Syndrome and Injury with which our soldiers are returning, in other families,\" she said gathered at a convention in support of Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest a \"ball issue\" and stated that her son, along with other war veterans, \"return a little other, hardened, to come back with the question of whether there was that respect for which soldiers, pilots, other militarymen, giving themselves to the country.\"
He was arrested on Monday in Wassila, Alaska and he was charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing an attempt to report domestic violence, assaulting a weapon in a drunken state, according to information Dan Bennett, press secretary for the Wassila Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging new policies to provide a berth
The eighteen states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new U.S. policy, which denies standing victims pressure from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an analytical note on Friday in Washington, D.C., to support a policy being challenged to provide the wharf, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Seshns case, which was opened in August by the American Civil Rights Union against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She stated that her partner \"and his friends from a brutal gang\" had raped her, but that the U.S. authorities refused the wharf on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The states' lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, of which there are the greatest number of requests for a wharf in the United States, as countries that have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American wharf policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed immigrants without documents that are victims of domestic violence to resort to the wharf.
Columbia County Attorney General Carl Reissin said on Friday that the new policy \"ignors decades of legislative experience in states, countries, and the world.\"
\"Federal legislation requires applications for the wharf to be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and a similar change violates this principle,\" it says in an analytical note.
Jurists also said in a note that policies denying immigrants were deteriorating the U.S. economy, saying often immigrants could be made entrepreneurs and \"create necessary jobs\".
Attorney General Jeff Seshns ordered immigration judges to no longer give the berth to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
\"The wharf is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or affiliation with a social group or political views,\" said Seshns on June 11, proclaiming this policy.
The wharf never meant solving the problems, even all the serious problems that people face around the world every day.
Desperate rescue work in Palu. During attempts to find those who survived, the number of deaths doubled.
Those who survived are in a very difficult situation.
\"Everything is very tense,\" says Risa Kusum's 35-year-old mother, calming down her little son with a temperature in the evacuation center of the demolished city of Palu.
\"Every minute the machine--fucking-- bring the bodies.
Clear water is very little.\"
Residents began to return to their ruined houses, handling hinty things, waking up to save everything that can be found.
Hundreds of people were wounded and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-point magnetum earthquake were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwy Harris, who broke his spine and shoulder, are outside Palou's army hospital, where patients are treated in the street due to strong jolts that are repeated.
He had tears in his eyes when he recalled feeling strong underground jolts in a hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
\"There was no time to escape.
I was stuck under the ruins of the wall,\" said Harris to the Associated Press, and added that his family had come to town to marry.
\"I heard my wife called for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
Hopefully they're safe.\"
The American ambassador accuses China of \"threats\" using \"propagandist ads\"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page advertisement in an American daily praising the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump mentioned a paid add-on to the China Daily in Des Moines Register in a mined newspaper in the state of Iowa in a pasty--after accusing China of attempting to intervene in the November 6 election to the American Congress.It's a charge China refutes.
Trump's indictment that China had tried to intervene in the American election marked what American officials in the name in a conversation with Reuters with a new phase in Washington's campaign to pressure China.
Though the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, now Beijing Yi Washington unleashed a trade war, the result of which was the mutual imposing of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, said American and Chinese experts, were introduced to hurt exporters such as entrepreneurs from the state of Iowa, who support Trump's Republican party.
Terry Brenstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and businessmen.
China, wrote Branstad in an author article in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, \"now doubling its efforts by printing propagandist advertisements in our free press.\"
\"By spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press by printing paid advertisements in Des Moines Register,\" wrote Brenstead.
\"And if you look at newspaper kiosks in Beijing, there you will find not so many voices against or see a real reflection of other assumptions that the Chinese might have about a dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking the fact that the press is under the iron fifth Communist Party of China,\" he wrote.
He added that \"one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused the offer\" to print his article, although he did not name that newspaper.
Republicans push back women voters on the eve of interim elections from the Cavanaugh fiasco, warn analysts
While many prominent Republicans defend candidate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh before face multiple sexual violence charges, analysts warned that they would get a blow in response, especially from women, during future interim elections.
Emotions around this were very strong, and most Republicans already show that they are willing to vote.
\"These things can no longer be brought back,\" said Grant Rihar, a professor of political science at Maxwell's Syracuse University School of Publishing for the article. which was printed on Saturday.
Rihar said he was unsure that the statements made by Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) about the investigation by the FBI would be enough to calm angry voters.
\"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget this tomorrow and in November,\" said Caryn Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and national press secretary of progressive group MoveOn newspaper from Washington, D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted \"Listfall soon!\" during a demonstration in a Senate lobby when Republicans controlling the legal committee decided to put out Kavanaugh's candidacy despite Dr. Christina Blasey Ford's statement, according to Mic.
\"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be extremely great,\" said news site Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
\"People say they're already high, and that's true.
But there can be even higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and young voters from 18 to 29, who though dislike the president, but often do not vote.\"
Even before Ford's opening statement, in which she detailed her charges to the Supreme Court candidate in sexual violence, analysts suggest that if Republicans insisted confirmations may have a seat strong hit in return.
\"For the Republican Party, this has been done by some mixed,\" said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Party's National Committee early last week, according to NBC News.
\"It's not about the committee's vote on either the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will get into office.Talking about how Republicans have dealt with it and how they've got to it,\" remark news channel Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, it is similar to the fact that Americans have separated into the issue of right-wing Ford or Kavanaugh, with little more advocating for the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are arguably or not very certain to trust Ford's bid, and 35 percent have said they are for sure or not very certain to trust Kavanaugh.
In addition to this, 38 percent said that, in their opinion, Kavanaugh was possibly or arguably smelting in his statement, and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following a push by Flake, the FBI investigates charges from Ford and at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath before the Senate Law Committee that Kavanaugh, when he was drunk, was seeking her as a 17-year-old.
Ramirez argues that the Supreme Court candidate demonstrated her genitals at a party when they studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world's web plans to start a New Internet to make up for Google and Facebook's competition
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the global web, launches a startup that is made by competitor Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that is built on Berners-Lee Solid's open platform.
Solid allows users to choose a data storage location and who has permission to access this information.
In an exclusive interview with the Berners-Lee Fast Company, he fires that by creating Inrupt, he meant \"a reign over the world\".
\"The thing to do is now,\" he said of the startup.
\"This is a historic moment.\"
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create \"own data repositories on the Internet\" or POD.
This may contain contact lists, case lists, calendars, fandom, and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available immediately on a single browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal data repository on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information is.
The company calls this a \"personal enhanced potential using data.\"
In John Bruce's opinion of the company's executive director, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to bring together resources, process and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers working on the project under contract and volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized applications, using tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Brunners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to \"Facebook and Google about whether or not they introduce full changes when all their business models will be reviewed instantly.
\"We don't ask their permission.\"
In a Saturday publication on the issue, Medium Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission \"is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of a new web created on Solid.\"
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet by creating the World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in advocating the network's neutrality.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Network Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
\"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the web,\" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Wang: Commemoration of the priest awarded by the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only priest of the Church of England awarded to the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a participant in the fighting was celebrated in his town 100 years later.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Wang was awarded on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack under Belenglis and Leacourt.
However, four days later he died from a sniper bullet and never learned that he had received the highest military British award.
On Saturday in Rushden Township, County Northamptonshire, two of his grandchildren on the parade opened a commemorative stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wang, said it was \"very symbolic\" that the stone opened exactly 100 years after his grandpa was awarded.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wang led his battalion across the Canal de San Quentin \"through a dense immature and under heavy pink and machine gun fire by an intruder.\"
Then he ran on the line of fire and \"with great boldness\" led the soldiers forward, capturing the cannon on his own and knocking out three detachments.
Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and little more than a month later the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Wang said his grandfather's actions were \"something I would never have been able to do and also something worthy of respect.\"
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after a parade headed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Wang said \"for his great honour to take part in the parade\" and added that \"the courage of the true hero has been demonstrated by the support provided by many.\"
MMA fans had a whole night waiting to see Bellator 206, they instead got Pep's pig
Just imagine you've stood up all night to view the packed gear from Bellator 206 and then you're denied watching the main event.
The programme with San JosÃ© had 13 fights, including six on the main map, and they were shown live all night on British television channel Channel 5.
And the sixth morning, when GÃ©rard Mousasi and Rory Macdonald were preparing for a swath, viewers in the United Kingdom simply stunned when the programme changed to Pepa's pig.
Some were disappointed after having spent a sleepless night specifically waiting for that fight.
One of the painkillers on Twitter called the switch to the baby mullet as \"a someone stupid joke\".
In response to a question about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communications said, \"According to the state ordinance at 6 a.m. this content was improper and we had to switch to a children's program.\"
\"Yes,--Pep's Pig--\"
Bellator company president Scott Coker said that in the future they would work on the programme to take British viewers into account.
\"I think we are discussing the possibility of repetition, in my own way, we can solve the issue,\" Coker said.
\"But now is the sixth morning on Sunday, and we won't be able to decide this until Sunday on our time, but it's Monday on their time.
But we do our best.
Believe when applications were changing, we got very many messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to resolve the issue, believing it to be a technical mistake.
But it turned out to be a state ordinance.
I'm able to promise that the next time this kind of thing doesn't happen.
We'll drop the amount of tails from six to five, as we do normally, by this time we wanted to parade the fans, but we got over.
It's a pricking situation.\"
\"Discs of a deserted island\": Tom Daley felt \"significant\" due to sexuality\"
Olympic water jump medalist Tom Daley said he grew up feeling insignificance for others due to his sexuality - but it gave him motivation on the way to success.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that \"not everyone like me\" until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's \"Discs of a deserted island\" program in lead by Lauren Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give others \"hope\".
He also stated that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional lead of this rather old program, Kirstie Young, took a vacation for months due to illness.
In the role of a man who ended up on a deserted island, on Laverne's first program, Daley said that as a child, he felt \"minor\" for everyone else because \"the society didn't take those who liked both boys and girls.\"
He said, \"I and now believe that this feeling that you're not like everyone and insignificant was something that gave me strength and inspiration for success.\"
He wanted to prove that he was \"somebody,\" he said, lest he disappoint those who learned of his sexuality.
The two-fold bronze medal-winning Olympians have been made a significant activist by the LGBT movement and at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was fortunate enough to live openly, without persecution and wanted to give \"hope\" to others.
A three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - an American scriptwriter, directors and presenter, Dustin Lance Blacke, whom he met in 2013 - \"it was unexpected to me\".
Daley married the owner of Oscar, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the difference in age is irrelevant.
\"If you go through such at such a young age\" - at the first Olympics he fell at age 14, and three more years later his father died of cancer - he said it was difficult to find a raven who would have experienced such take-offs and falls.
In June, they were made by their parents, their son being called Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said his \"perspectives have changed completely\".
\"If you asked me last year, I'd tell you I needed to win a gold medal,\" he said.
\"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the Olympic gold medal.
Robbie - that's my Olympic gold medal.\"
His son is also called as his father - Robert. His father died in 2011 aged 40 of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics - he wanted to sit in the first row.
\"I couldn't tell him--you won't sit in the first row, Dad--\" he said.
\"I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize he was not immortal,\" he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympique and won the bronze medal.
\"I just knew that it was about it that dreamed his whole life - jumping into the water in front of his ballplayers at the Olympics, that's the very best feeling,\" he said.
It also influenced the song's choice of - Proud from Heather Small  - which found echoes in it in preparation for the olympics and from which the ants are now running.
\"Discs of a deserted island\" can be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 a.m. on British Summer Time.
Mickelson, who is not in shape, stays on the bench of spares in Ryder's Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will put on a record on Sunday by playing his 47 games in Ryder's cup, but he needs to regain form so that this event is not made miserable.
Mickelson, who will play in this competition, which is held once every two years, a record 12th time team captain Jim Fury has planted a reserve bench on Saturday's forays.
Instead of being at the center of the event, and he was there often for the United States team, a five-fold cup winner split his days between the job of a redshirt and training, hoping to return to form.
Even at the peak of his career, he was not the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer is not the perfect choice for the uneasy Le Golf National field, where there are fiercely punishable inaccurate punches.
And if the field itself is not bleak enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, will compete against the exact British Open champion Francesco Malinari, who along with Tommy Fleetwood, won all four games this week.
If the Americans who stand down by four points at first 12 single games will start with successes, Mickelson's match may prove extremely important.
FÃ¼rik expressed confidence in this player, but could say nothing more.
\"He fully understood his role today, splashed me down the back, attached and said that tomorrow would be ready,\" said Furyk.
\"He's very sure of himself.
He was admitted to the Hall of Fame and gave very many teams last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two games.
I planned more, but I worked exactly that way and that's how we thought we were playing.
He wants to be on the field, too, like everyone else.\"
Mickelson would beat Nick Fald's record for the number of matches in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
This could be the end of Ryder's Cup career, which was never the same as achievements in individual games.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losers and seven poles, though Fury said his presence brought the team a favour.
\"He's funny, sarcastic, with humor, he likes to fire over people and just a very good person who has good on the team,\" he explained.
\"I think more young players gladly parodied his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the team a lot more than just a game.\"
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large breakaway may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, from experience knows that a significant breakaway before the last day's individual games on Ryder's cup may disappear easily.
The Danish player debuted in the 1997 game in Walder where the European-led team Sev Ballesteras had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but finished with a minimum advantage of 141-2-131-2.
\"Permanently reminding yourself that in Walder we had a big advantage and won, but with difficulty, we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost,\" said Bjorn after watching the Class of 2018 team win 5-3 and Friday, and yesterday, and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
\"History shows me and everyone else on the team that this isn't the end yet.
Tomorrow you have to play all hundred.
Get out on the field and do everything right.
As long as the points didn't appear in the table, nothing is over.
We have a goal and that's a - trying to win this trophy, that's what we're focusing on.
I constantly say this, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that there are the best players in the world on the opposite side.\"
Satisfied with how his players played on a difficult golf field, BjÃ¸rn added, \"I will never overvalue myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a completely different game.
Tomorrow there will be individual games, and that's totally different.
Just fine, if you're on the field with your partner and everything goes well, but if you play one, then here you're dealing with your real golfist talents.
Here's what you have to bring to the players that they have to show the very best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, the pits have to go and also show everything best as an individual player.\"
Unlike Bjorn, his rival Jim Furyk hopes for a better individual game of his athletes than the one they demonstrated in partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
FÃ¼rik was himself on both sides of these last day matches, playing on the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had a Miracle in Medina.
\"I remember every word of it,\" he said, answering a question as Ben Crencho, captain of 1999, tuned his players on the final day.
\"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but always want to have a fast start you've seen in Brooklyn and in Medina.
If speed grows, then the biggest pressure turns out to be on those playing matches in the middle.
We put together the appropriate schedule and we put players in the way we liked it. Know tomorrow we're trying to get a little magic.\"
Thomas was given the task of starting to play and against Rory Macilroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rouse, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter would play against the top golfers.
\"I put my players in that order because I think I will so close everything,\" said BjÃ¸rn about his choice for individual matches.
Launch of new German warship postponed again\"
Germany's new Navy frigate was to enter the tier in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it would not appear until the following year due to erratic systems and steadily increasing costs, according to local media reports.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the absolutely new class of Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit wrote, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to enter the tier in 2014, but the problems that came after construction are hampered by this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships ordered as early as 2007 must replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with strong guns, various anti-shipping and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some \"steals\" technologies, such as reduced visibility for radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among the other important characteristics of the - longer periods between the tehabslugging  - newer frigates may not go into their ports for up to two years.
However, the constant postponements mean that modern battleships - which may allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country - are getting old by the time they finally enter the tier, mark Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate fell into headlines last year when the German IMF officially refused to take the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media wrote about many \"defects in software and equipment\" that make the ship wasted on a combat mission.
The software failures were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships have only 120 sailors - half the crew of old Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been found that the ship has very great weight, which reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tonnes, which is twice the weight of ships of similar class that used Germany in World War II.
In addition to the poached equipment, the price of the entire project - including crew training - is also made a problem.
Tsan reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - albeit at first it was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that pile up with the new frigates are being made particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is decreasing.
Early this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, said that the IMF \"has fewer and fewer ships suitable for military missions\".
He stated that the problem would eventually increase because the old ships were listed and there were no ships to replace.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were capable of joining the IMF.
The National Society for the Protection of Monuments listened to the secret lives of bats
A new study conducted in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
Scholars hope to find something new in the behavior of unique flying milkshakes and help in future actions to preserve these animals.
A study by scholars of the National Monuments Conservation Society of Scotland deals with small bats and also the stormy long-eared Dabanton bats in the Inverie Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in the main locations of this area to keep track of the bats' actions during the season.
Society workers and volunteers will conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all records will determine the frequency of bat calls, as well as which bats do.
The habitat map and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Djoir, advisor to the National Society for Conservation of Nature hopes that the results will show which areas are most important to bats and how each of the species uses them.
This information will help determine the advantages of creating habitats such as meadows, and how to maintain forests to live bats and other associated animals.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and developer work that affects and destroys habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, also as sticky ribbons for flies and some chemicals for building materials. They are also threatened by domestic cats.
Cazenes aren't blind at all.
However, due to their nightlife, bat ears are more audible than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use complex echolocation techniques to detect beetles and obstacles in the path of flight.
The National Society, which is responsible for over 270 buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, are very serious about bats.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, residence checks, and, at times, rescue activities.
The organisation even created the first and only Scottish bat bailiff at the Triw estate in Dumfries and Galway, where eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland live.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says it is an ideal territory for bats.
\"Here in Trive, we just have a great place for bats,\" he said.
\"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a very good habitat.
But we don't know much about bats yet, so our work here and in other estates will help to understand more what they need for a better life.\"
He emphasizes the importance of checking for the presence of bats before undergoing repairs to the property, as one can unintentionally destroy one sedal, killing up to 400 females and young bats, leading to the complete destruction of the local population.
Cazens are under protection and they are not allowed to kill, frighten, incapacitate, or destroy their sedals.
Elizabeth Fairall, an employee of the bat welfare organisation in Scotland, is urging the public to assist in the case.
She says, \"We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and about many of the species we don't even know how their populations live.\"
Ranaldo refutes the rape charges, and his lawyers are about to file in court for a German magazine
Krisztianu Ranaldo called the accusations against him being raped by the \"feast news\", saying that people want to \"reclaim themselves\", using his name.
His lawyers are going to be sued by the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these charges.
Forward's constituency of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rapeing American woman Catherine Majorgo in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then he'd like to pay her $375,000 for silence, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
In the Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ranaldo contacted 142 million of his subscribers hours after the accusations were published, calling this message \"fair news\".
\"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news,\" said five-time Gold Ball owner in front of the camera.
\"They want to make an ad on my name.
It's normal.
They want to make famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm a happy and kind man,\" he added with a smile.
Jurists Ranaldo are preparing a case in court against Der Spiegel magazine over the issue of the charges, which called \"an inappropriate report of suspicions in a private case,\" reports the Reuters agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would request compensation for \"moral damage in a sum consistent with the difficulty of violating rights, and over the past few years this may be the most serious violation of personal rights.\"
Being having a site incident occurred in the June 2009 issue of luxury atelier Palms Hovtell and Casinos in Las Vegas.
Meeting in the nightclub of Ranaldo and Majorgo as if he were back in the football player's room, where he had allegedly raped her anally, as written in the Clark County Circuit Court papers in the state of Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ranaldo had excommunicated afterwards and said that on \"99 percent\" he was a \"good guy\" suffering from \"one percent\".
The documents state that Ranaldo admitted that they had sex, but by the consent of the parties.
Majorga claims also that she went to the police and took pictures of the hospital damage, but then agreed to an out-of-court regulation because she was \"very afraid of revenge\" and she was incapacitated that she was \"publicly humiliated\".
The 34-year-old woman says she now wants to recover the accusation because she feels a moral injury for that case.
In a time when it was as if he had a place this case Ranaldo was going to move into Madrid Real with Manchestor Junaytid, and this summer he moved to Italy's Juventus, closing the 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: UK 'always regrets' car-builders' loss\"
The UK is \"forever poised\" if it loses its status as the world automotive leader after Brexit, said Business Affairs Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was being \"incapacitated\" by Toyota UK for the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily cut production at a factory in Bernaston, nearby Derby in half.
\"We need an agreement,\" Mr Clark said.
A Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border as a result of Brexit without an agreement could result in reduced workplaces.
The factory in Bernaston  - where Toyota Auris and Avensis are doing  - last year released nearly 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
\"In my opinion, when Britain will leave the EU in late March, production at our plant will stop,\" said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have raised the issue of how cross-border trade will be made if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. among them Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main non-pace is related to what motorists say is the risk of supply chains as a result of Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyota production line runs based on \"exactly in time\" when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars making the order.
If the United Kingdom will leave the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there may be disruptions at the border leading to delays and shortages of parts.
It will not be possible for Toyota to keep more than a day's parts reserve at the factory in Derby, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's \"Checkers Plan\" on future relations with the EU \"is done exactly so as to avoid these border checks.\"
\"We need an agreement.We want to get the best agreement that will allow not only the success of today, but we will also allow us to use that opportunity,\" he said on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.
\"The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, hints that we should be able to continue working successful supply chains.\"
The Toyota company was unable to report how long production would not work, but on future warning that the added cost would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and lead to reduced workplaces.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who works at Bernaston for 24 years and is a trade union coordinator, said that union members are very concerned, \"By my request, if jobs are cut, they will no longer recover.
The government's press secretary said, \"We have proposed an accurate plan for our future relations with the EU deserving of trust.\"
The White House states that Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be \"delayed for another week\", while a fight around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, said a White House spokesman on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who examines interference in elections from Russia, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia and the potential obstruction of justice from the president.
Free Trump's Assistant Attorney General or not, and thus put Mueller's independence at risk, moons pour oil into the fire of the Washington gossips.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the ability to take a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the ability to remove the president from office using the 25 amendment.
Rosenstein refuted this.
But last Monday he went to the White House amidst rumors that he was going to resign.
It was announced instead that Thursday that there would be a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN headquarters in New York City at the time.
Trump said he \"wouldn't want to\" dismissal Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash at a hearing before the Senate Law Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, spoke.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI's allegations against Kavanaugh that further slowed the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday's Sunday program.
When asked about meeting Rosenstein, she said, \"The date is not yet intended, perhaps this week, perhaps next.I believe that rather a week later, taking note of all other things that have a place in the Supreme Court case.
But everything will happen and I always give the press the most new information.\"
Some journalists are ready to challenge her drill: Sanders has not conducted press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Lead program Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the briefings was not caused by contempt for telereporters who were \"working for the public\", although she added, \"Againd the fact that they are working for the public.\"
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
\"The president is holding more meetings with answers to press questions than any president that was before him,\" she said, adding without specific facts, \"We have studied these numbers.\"
The briefings are happening, Sanders reported, but \"if the press has the chance to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it's a lot better than doing it through me.
We'll wake up doing it often, you've seen us do it in the last few weeks. Such meetings at which you can ask the question directly to the president will replace the briefings.\"
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House either taking part in street meetings or at press conferences with high foreign guests.
Press conferences of the president himself rarely take place.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, if free and sometimes extravagant, he appeared before reporters.
The Minister for Health wrote to workers from EU countries in Scotland's health system before Brexit
The Minister for Health wrote to workers from the EU working in Scotland's health system to express gratitude on behalf of the country and to wish that they remain after Brexit as well.
Jen Freeman sent a letter less than half a year before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government is already prepared to cover the cost of livelihood applications from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter to Mrs Freeman, she wrote, \"Let's talk between Britain and the EU about our country's withdrawal.They are leading to anticipated decisions this fall.
But the British government also hastened to prepare for the scenario without agreement.
I know it's a very troubled time for all of you.
So I want to remind me how much I appreciate the contribution of every worker, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all countries in the EU and not only, provide valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of health services, also bear the benefits of patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us.\"
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers team Christion Abercrombie underwent an urgent operation after he sustained a head injury in Sunday's match, which his team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reports Mike Organ of Tennessean.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury the player received shortly before the break.
\"He switched to the sideline and suddenly fell down,\" Reed said.
Trainers and medics gave Abercombi oxygen still in the field before putting him on a stretcher and moving him to set up a diagnosis.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been tested at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no \"subjects about what injury it was\" and Tennessee State are prevented from detecting when the player was injured.
Abercombi, a secondary sportsman, spends his first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full interceptions, giving just 18 interceptions per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay more mail
According to the new Conservatives plan, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher post office, and additional money will go to help the homeless
This action neutralizes the pouring success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
Enhancing the state's duties will rebate on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance plans to get up to Â£120 million a year to help the homeless
Today, Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher government post, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters as well as dosi affordable housing.It is aimed at high-income people.
The raising of the state post office is aimed at individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the government's housing giving program homeless.
The elevation of the current state post office, including higher levels taken two years ago, to purchase second homes and housing for hire, can amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to receive up to 120 million pounds a year.
Estimated 13 percent of newcomers in London are being bought by UK non-residents, this leads to price increases and new buyers are making it hard to buy their first housing.
Many of the rich regions of the country - especially the capital  - have been made \"a ghost town\" because a large number of buyers from abroad live not in the UK for most of the time.
The new policy came literally weeks after Boris Johnson's call to reduce the state post office for young buyers to facilitate the acquisition of the first housing.
He accused large construction firms of holding high real estate prices by taking over and using land, and urged Mistress May to cancel affordable housing quotas to impose a \"honest position with housing\" in Britain.
Mr Corbin announced a voice-over series of housing reforms, including rent control and the termination of an \"outstanding\" eviction.
He also wants to hand over more powers to local councils in the area of housing construction.
Mistress May said, \"In the past year I said I will dedicate my work to the post of Prime Minister restoring the British dream - life for every new generation should be done best.
It means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is unfair that individuals who do not reside in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate also easily, as can the working inhabitants of Britain.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home is made increasingly unattainable, and the problem of the homeless remains very real.\"
Jack Ross: \"My main ambition is to run Scottish constituency\"
Sanderland coach Jack Ross said his main ambition was to ever be done by a Scottish national team coach.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is tasked with restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in third place of the First League, in three points from the first.
He moved on to that job in the summer, after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
\"I wanted to speak for my country as a player.
But it didn't work out,\" said Ross in a BBC Scotland's Sportssound broadcast.
\"I grew up, often sickening for Scotland at Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
However, such an opportunity will occur if I am to be a successful club coach.\"
Among Ross' predecessors on the Board of Cenderland coach are Dick Lawyer, Daveyd Moyes, Sam Allardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kean, Gus Poye and Paula di Kanya.
Former coach Aloo Athletic says he felt no fear of such famous names in such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"Now the success for me will be the answer to the question 'or can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'\"
According to the club's structure and material base its place is for sure in the Premier League,\" he said.

Ross only works as a coach for three years, before which he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked for 15 months at the Harts coaching staff.
Then he helped Aloa return from the third league and turned St Mirren out of a failure that almost got into Champianship in the next season's winner.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Recalling the work at \"Aloah\", he said \"It was a really important choice.\"
\"I really believed that coaching work was what I needed, even more than a game.
Sounds incredible because I worked well, earned well and reached certain heights.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
Me and now go through this when you talk about stress and pressure, but coaching work is what you need to do.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, and for me it's the nicest time in my entire adult life.\"

Hot Summer raised the profits of British pubs struggling to survive, but brought pressure on networks of restaurants.
According to the statistics of the pub and bar group noted a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but sales volume dropped 4.8 percent in restaurants.
Peter Martin of CGA's consulting business group, who collected this statistics, said, \"The continued solar weather and the longer than expected English rally participation in the World Cup final means that in July, what was happening in June, when pubs increased sales by 2.8 percent, and here restaurants suffered even more.
Reducing sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June, only worsened in July.
pubs and bars that mainly sell drinks as long as they showed the best result as opposed to restaurants.
The pubs, which sell food more, were also posing in the sun, albeit not as strong as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent, and food sales fell by three percent.\"
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst on rest and deployment said, \"These results are made by the Trend we have been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to the volume of sales in the social food market.
No wonder restaurants keep struggling because sales have dropped by 4.8 percent per year, and that's very unpleasant when costs are constantly growing.
The long and hot summer came at the most bad time for operators who are focused on food, and time will show if lower temperatures in August will bring such expected relief.\"
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the recently opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting slowness in brand deployments.
A sales tracking tool in British pubs, bars and restaurants, the Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes productivity data from 47 active groups that have a total turnover of Â£9 billion, and is an important landmark of this branch.
Every fifth child has a secret account in the satznets that it hides from parents
The study showed that every fifth child - some only turned 11  - has secret accounts in the nets it hides from parents and teachers
Studying 20,000 high school students showed growth of \"fable Insta\" pages
That news warmed fears that there would publish sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a \"basic\" account showing parents
Every fifth child - some only turned 11  - creates accounts in the satznets that keep secret from their parents.
Studying 20,000 secondary school students found the rapid growth of \"fable Insta\" accounts - which were as if leading to Instagram's photography sharing site.
This news has warmed fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of students said they were running \"clean\" \"basic\" accounts to show parents, and also run private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, learned that she had been urged by others to \"lose me\".
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and a conference of Independent Schools (HMC) directors, found that 40 percent of teenagers between 11 and 18 had two profiles each year, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chapter Mike Buchanan said, \"It's very incoherent that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where they're not found by parents or teachers.\"
Eilid Doyle will be the \"guess of athletes\" at the Scottish Council of Athletics
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Council of Athletics as an observation board member at that body's annual general meeting.
Doyle - Scotland's most titled athlete and chairman Ian Biti described the event as a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport to gain many benefits from its experience at a wide variety of levels, including international over the past decade.
\"Eilid enjoys great respect in Scotland, the UK and the global sporting community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will get a lot useful from her work on the council,\" Biti said.
Doyle said, \"I want to act as the voice of athletes and I hope I will help manage the sport in Scotland.\"

The small pump advertisement, where mothers are compared to cows, shared opinions on the Internet
The dairy pump production company shared opinions by releasing advertisements comparing food women to cows being given.
To mark the launch of what they call \"the world's first wearing a baby pump\" the consumer company Elvie released an ironic video-based music ad to show the freedom that it gives to the device of the feeding mother.
The four real mothers dance in a pig with cows under a song where there are such words: \"Yes, I give myself, but the tail I don't have\" and \"On occasion, if you haven't noticed, it's not a whim, it's my chest.\"
And I do, \"Dai, yes, I feed my kids, doi, I give my women.\"
However, an advertisement that was posted on the campaign's Facebook page sparked a heated discussion on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments.The response to the video was mixed, many saying it was a horror of small-scale production.
\"A very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to harden and give birth to give milk, here's just their kids picking up in a few days,\" wrote one viewer.
Small Elvie pump inducibly hides in busthalt for feeders (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: \"It's understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a baby pump for mothers who don't take away children?\"
Someone added, \"Such an unthinkable ad.\"
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that she considered the song \"forsaken\".
\"I think it's a genius idea.
I'd like to have such if I fed my breasts.
The sucking milk makes me feel like a cow.
That ad's a little crazy, but I liked it.
It's a genius product,\" she wrote.
Another commentary is, \"A very fun advertisement aimed at mothers sucking the milk with a pump (often in a workplace or in a tuale) and hearing themselves as 'the cows'.\"
This ad does not exhilarate or condemn the dairy industry.\"
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with invisible baby pumps hidden in bustgators.
The ad campaign concept is based on that fact that many women using baby pumps feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump's pump is fully soundless, has neither rights nor tubes and is unremarkably hidden in a bustle for feeder women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep children, and even go out of the house while the device works.
Ana Ballarin, partner and Creative Director of Mother Company observed, \"Elvie Pump is so revolutionary a product that it deserves a clear and provocation run.
Carrying a parallel between food women and dairy cows we wanted to pay attention to sucking milk and its difficulty while demonstrating the fun and good-natured way the new baby pump would bring extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's no longer the first time Elvie's baby pump gets into the center of attention.
During London Fashion Week, mothers of two children appeared on the podium in clothes from Marty Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children without excess noise are being transported to a hint of camp on the Texas border
Although the number of border crossings per month has hardly changed, the number of migrant children detained rose dramatically, in part the reason for this being served by the harsh rhetoric and policies carried out by the Trump administration that burdened the placement of children with sponsorship.
Traditionally, most sponsors are immigrant illegals who fear to jeopardize their own stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
The risks rose considerably in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other full-time household members would need to file fingerprints and data would be transferred to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking Immigration and Customs Service official, spoke before Congress regarding the agency's arrests report to dozens of people who were petitioning to sponsor minors without escort.
The agency later reported that 70% of those arrested previously had no lawsuits.
\"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors of either members of their households are in the country illegally, and much of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That's why we keep pursuing such people,\" said Mr Olbens.
For faster child processing, officials introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, with, according to asylum workers, the previously standard term was 60 days.
A large number of people to file their own legal status application to an immigration judge will have to use video communication rather than attend court in person.
Those who are considered to have no reason to provide assistance are quickly deported.
According to pryut workers and reports from sources in the system that have emerged over the past few months, the longer children remain in prison, the higher the likelihood of depression occurring or an increase in disrepair, which could lead to explosions of violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers state that in larger institutions such as Tarnilla, these problems are found to be much stronger, as signs that the child is in a gutter state will be ignored with greater likelihood due to the size of the facility.
They add that moving children into hinted township without providing time for emotional training or to parting ways with friends may make the injury worse, which many and so have already encountered.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of \"occupation forces\" by the United States, France and Turkey
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home despite the war continuing in the country for an eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and that \"of them will consider accordingly\".
\"They should leave immediately and without putting any conditions,\" he said at the Assembly meeting.
Mualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of people had to quit their homes, \"the war on terror is virtually over\".
He reported that Damascus intends to continue to \"bring this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories\" from both terrorist groups and \"any illegal foreign presence\".
Syria is home to approximately 2,000 U.S. troops who mainly act as instructors and advisors to the Kurds and Syrian Arab forces who are in opposition to President Bashar Assad.
France's ground contingent in this war-torn country is over 1,000 troops.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said that the conditions for return were favourable and accused \"some Western countries\" of \"spreading irrational fears\" that contain refugees overseas.
\"We urge the international community and humanitarian organizations to plant their return,\" he says.
\"They politicize solely the humanitarian issue.\"
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in the recovery until a political agreement to end the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major stronghold of Idlib rebels created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale offensive by Syrian forces backed by Russia on a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had \"exact terms\", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants from the al-Qaeda-related Nousra front, who would \"be destroyed\".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes in the near future to convene the first sittings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem expressed terms of Syrian government participation in the committee, saying that the work of the commission should be limited to \"overseeing the articles of the current constitution\", and a shift from intervention.
Why Trump will go to a second term
By this logic Mr Trump will win the 2020 election, when, as many liberal spectators hope, impeachment and scandal pre-term will not culminate in his presidency.
And that, no doubt, will be \"The very dramatic finale of the presidency in all history!\"
At the moment, there are no signs of viewers being tired.
Since 2014, ratings in primetime have risen more than twice as much as 1.05 million on CNN and nearly three times as much as 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in primetime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show's broadcasts of the MSNBC channel gathered 3.5 million viewers off-screen and crossed cable television ratings in the evenings when broadcast by major news outlets.
\"This is the fire that people pull to, because we don't understand it,\" says Neil Berr, director of the ABC drama The Permeant about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nelly Scowell, a masque scripted comedian and author of the book Couple of Funny Details and a Few Cruel Truths about Infiltration into the Hollywood Boys' Club, there is another theory.
She mentions a trip to a taxi in Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr Trump.
-Why?  - asked she.
He replied, \"Because he cheers me,\" Ms Scowell said to me.
Chaos is valuable yet by what can amuse.
Of course, unlike all the rest of television, the storylines coming out of Washington may become as much of a definite future as the \"Rove Against Wade\" case, it depends on whether the families of immigrants will be able to join together and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, if you're a sixth hour watch as a group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodward's \"information not for printing\" in the book Fright, Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 of mealy skin (a garment embroidered by pride as written in The Washington Post), and the implications of the sharp descriptions of Storm Daniels, um, Mr. Trump's anatomy, this comes out for the simple framework of wanting to be aware of cases.
I, for example, will never look at the Super Mario just like before.
\"Part of what he's doing makes you feel as if you're watching the reality show he's showing every evening,\" says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars (Stars Like Sands) about Trump's show's changing acting composition and the constant twists of the story (\"sparing\" from the NFL, praising Kim Cheng-yin).

When I talked to Mr Fleiss this week, behind the windows of his house on the north bank of Kauai stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees of heat, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not fail, not when Brett Cavanaugh rose before the Senate Judiciary Committee, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which hung on the hairpin.
\"I remember the diners when we were producing these crazy shows, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'\" said Mr Fleiss to me.
\"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.\"

External cash flows pour into the hard-line pre-election race of interim elections to the House of Representatives
It is surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th electoral district has covered money zoning thanks to changing the boundaries of districts made by Congress, causing two candidates to contest elections for one seat.
The recently repaint suburban district of Pitzburg is surrounded by a Democrat, member of the Conor Lamb House of Representatives, who won his seat in another district in a by-election last spring.
Lamb is opposed by another incumbent MP, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is largely the same as the new 17th.
The briefs were repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district votes were unconstitutionally counted in favor of Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused the campaign to drop funding by the financial groups of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (CCDC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in a widely dedicated by-election in Pennsylvania's 18th district in March.
This seat has now been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point breakout.
Political experts are constituting a small preference for Democrats.
The United States appreciated the possibility of El Salvador being punished for its support of China and then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported Beijing's position, despite a slight antidote from Washington.
Mr Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until partners evicted Trump's leadership team.
State Department officials decided to recall American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama due to \"independence decisions on Taiwan's failure to recognize,\" said Press Secretary to the State Department, Heather Nauert early this month.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in American aid in 2017, including drug turnover controls, development, and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include financial aid reductions and target restrictions on visa extradition, would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment rate and killings.
As internal meetings were completed, representatives of North and Central America postponed holding a conference at a high level dedicated to security and economic prosperity that would become a continuation of a similar meeting last year, which was slated to be a step in efforts to prevent immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking administration officials made it clear that they want the conference to take place and effectively stop considering the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pencia will now speak at a conference that is scheduled for mid-October, as a sign that the administration is in favour of holding the event.
And three American envoys with no excess noise returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new severe messages or penalties from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton refused to comment on details of the debate, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues subject to maintaining anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by another, close to the administration analyst, who also wished to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step may be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller regarding possible obstruction of justice to Mr Trump, of examples currently having very weighty evidence in public character documents.
Mr Mueller is reported to have drawn attention to the investigation into the possibility of a Trump and Russia campaign conspiracy in the attack on the election.
If Congress changes the landlord, Mr. Trump will end up in the face of responsibility to this body, just as he is preparing to speak again before the voters, and perhaps ultimately, before jurors from among his colleagues.
There's a lot of \"if\", and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just like he like that in Europe.
All of us, on either side of the Atlantic, must make a choice that will determine how much the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'Ã©tat against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and let the opportunity avoid the next few years of bloodshed.
History curls around similar turning moments, and the impotent march of democracy accelerates or is set aside.
The straight now Americans have faced several of these turning moments.
What happens when Mr. Trump is fired by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has found himself in a difficult position since the paper wrote about what he suggested in secret to record the President's words last year and pondered his prof unfitness.
Mr Rosenstein says the Times recount is inaccurate.
\"How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Cavan's case is not comprehensive or fair, or if it is approved in the Supreme Court, despite worthy confidence charges of sexual violence and dishonest indications?
And above all, will we in voting in the election for Congress, which will involve Mr Trump in accountability?
Unless we pass these trials, long winters will come for democracy.
But I believe we won't let up thanks to the lesson I've adopted in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak gabraka who was deported to Auschwitz by that very Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America and after 60 years she sent me to light up the Sabbath candles on this table with a swastika.
With such a legacy as I may not be an optimist with regard to our future?\"

Graham Dorrance of Rangers optimistically tuned in the day before the match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive no-hitter in Spain over Villarreal early this month will allow them to confidently withdraw from Group G of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented halfback Graham Dorrans from performing for the first time in the season to none 2-2 with Villarreal; however, he believes that Rangers will be able to take advantage of this result as a trump.
\"It was an essential match for us, because Villarreal is a strong opponent, '--discussing a 31-year-old footballer.
\"We started the game thinking we could get something, and we earned a point.
Maybe at the end we could kill the ball, but on the whole, nothing too was a good result.
They looked better in the first time, but in the second we took our hands, and we had the best half of the field.
On Thursday there will be another significant to European football night.
Hopefully we'll be able to earn three points, but it'll be a difficult game, as they showed a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of buzzers in the stands, I'm sure we'll be able to handle them and show them a good game.
The minute year has been determined to be difficult, both because of my injuries and my changes in the club itself, but we now have a confidence factor.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy the game; training is productive.
Hopefully we will be able to move forward, cross the outcome last season, and succeed.\"
Women lose their sleep for fear of pension piles
Despite the fact that survey participants had an accurate idea of what they want for themselves to care for, few of them spoke about it with members of their families.
About half of the people involved in the nationwide study were reported to have spoken to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
\"People want family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to discuss it,\" says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwise on life insurance.
That's what you're worth starting with.
Discuss this with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you unless you advancely voice your wishes.
Work with a consultant and family and discuss where and how to receive medical care, as this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Involve to discuss the financial consultant. he can also help find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance polis, a hybrid life insurance polis that will help cover these costs or you can insure your life on your own - provided you have the money.
Solve cases with legal documents: I'm predicting court batals.
Get credentials for medical care to assign a trusted person to control your health care and ensure that you perform specialists of your wishes in case you can't talk.
In addition, consider issuing credibility on finance management.
Appoint a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the details: imagine that your elderly father needs immediate medical care, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about banned medications and the presence of allergies?
Note these details in a written way to be ready.
\"Have a role not only on financial issues but also on doctors' professionalism.\" - Martin adds.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that collapsed on the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to communications blackout, officials involved in humanitarian aid were unable to obtain any information from the Dongal Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake's epicenter with a strength of 7.5 points.
In Pal, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a seditious disaster.
Here are some key facts about Pal and Dongal on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow cove on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
When the earthquake occurred and a tsunami came, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the founding.
The Dongala - regency that extends along more than 180 miles (300 km) of shoreline on the northwest side of Sulawesi Island.
The regency is an administrative unit status below the province and had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The nikel mining is also important to the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency to mitigate the aftermath of natural disasters, Palu and Dongal have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed in Dongal by the tsunami, and hundreds of homes were demolished.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Dongal in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is in a seismic-active Pacific fire ring and it is regularly rocked by earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that rocked 14 countries resulting in 226,000 deaths along the entire Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes rocked the west coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 Magnitude earthquake occurred in the south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that rocked the south coast, resulting in the deaths of around 700 people.
2009: In the city of Padang, the provincial capital of Western Sumatra, a 7.6-point earthquake occurred.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake occurred on one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake rocked Pidi Jaya's regency in Aceh province, causing havoc and panic as people he reminded of the devastation as a result of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami came this time, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes rocked the tourist island of Indonesia, Lambok, resulting in the deaths of over 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists with no way to leave.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son is arrested on charges of domestic violence from his family's
Track Paylin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Paylin of Basila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, contradicting reports of domestic violence and resistance to the arrest published on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when one acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked the phone into it.
According to a KTUU channel report, Paylin is in the Matanuska-Susitna Insulator investigation under a $500 bet.
He appeared in court on Saturday where he declared himself \"exactly innocent\" when he was asked if he would plead guilty, the network reports.
Paylin is charged with three Class A offences, for which he is threatened with parole for up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B offence punishable by parole for a day and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that charges have been laid against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police for her to talk about the alleged attack.
The case is currently in consideration for the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forging a report on family violence, and storing weapons in a state of alcohol intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Paylin has been criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for linking her son's brutal behavior to post-traumatic syndrome caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake by a force of 7.5 points caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working, and it is expected that the number of victims will grow in the coming days.
The quake took place just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Videos spread on social networks showing a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami swung ashore.
The Federal Attorney's Office requires a rare death sentence for a terror suspect in New York City
The Federal Prosecution Service in New York City houses the death penalty for Saiful Saipaw, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare penalty that had not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, age 30, in October allegedly used a taken-up directional truck from the Home Depot Company to ride a bicycle track along the Westside Chase in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the death sentence, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipaw had \"intentionally\" beaten eight people and \"intentionally\" caused serious bodily harm.
According to the Court's materials, a penalty measure in the form of a death penalty is possible for both offences.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal investigation jury stunned Saipov with a 22-point indictment that included eight charges of murder to support the racketeering; this point is commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the attack required \"strange and deliberate planning\", and describing the crimes committed, they used phrases such as \"disgusting, cruel and depraved\".
\"Saifula Habibulajevich Saipov caused injuries, caused damage, and brought losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, NicolÃ¡s Cleves, Ana-Lori Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, HernÃ¡n Feruch, HernÃ¡n Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuk,\" is told in a message of intent.
The five dead were tourists from Argentina.
Since the last crime case began with a penalty measure in the form of a death penalty in the Southern District of New York, ten years have passed.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug providers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the death penalty in New York City in a federal case was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs, a married couple executed after they had been convicted two years earlier for conspiracy to spy in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
A pair of Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an outcast from Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated a lack of conscience rebukes in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he stated to investigators that he feels satisfaction with his act.
According to the abductor's imprisonment, Saipov informed authorities that he had been inspired to watch the Islamic State video on the phone.
He also requested permission to hang the Islamic State flag in the hospital chamber, police reported.
He does not plead guilty to an abductive conclusion consisting of 22 points.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipawa, said that they were \"reasonably disappointed\" by the prosecution's decision.
\"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only lengthen the pain from these events for all participants,\" Pathan said.
Saipawa's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of parliament from the Tories says Nigel Farage should designate talks on Brexit.
Today during a protest at the Tory Party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to \"mobilize the people's army\".
Former Ukip leader said politicians should \"feel discomfort\" from the Eurosceptics - as one of parliament's members Theresa May offered his candidacy for talks with the EU.
A member of parliament from the Conservative party, Peter Bown, said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would already \"come out\" if Mr Farage had served as Secretary for Brexit.
But the problem faced by Mistress May trying to reconcile her disparate supporters has yet to get worse when the Tories, who are in favour of maintaining EU membership have arranged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Premier of All Forces tries to keep the compromised Chequer Agreement under constant pressure from supporters and members of the exit as well as the EU itself.
The Allies insist on continuing their attempts to conclude a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and \"the mess\".
Mr Boun said at a rally in Solihall, \"Sitting Away\" (Leave Means Leave), that he wants to \"screw Chequer off the board\".
He proposed that Mr Faraj make equals and made duties for negotiating with Brussels.
\"If he were responsible, we'd already be out,\" he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added, \"I'm for Brexit, but we need to walk away from the Checker Plan.\"
Speaking against the EU, he said, \"We did not wage world war to be addicted.
We want to enforce our own laws in our country.\"
Mr Bown rejected speculation that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: \"The idea that the British had changed their opinion and want to stay is completely inconsistent with reality.\"
A Brexit supporter and Tory member, Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and in a conversation with journalists, she said, \"I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
\"The Chequer Plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and the activists who are actually going out on the streets and picking us up.
Please abandon the plan and start listening.\"
In a sharp address to Mistress May, she added, \"Prime Ministers remain in office when they fulfill their promises.\"
Mr Farage said politicians needed to force \"a sense of discomfort\" if they were going to betray the decision passed in the 2016 referendum.
\"It is now a matter of confidence between us  - people and politicians,\" he said.
\"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'It won't get you off your hands-'\"
In his address to the captured crowd, he added, \"I want you to make those of our politicians who are willing to betray Brexit feel discomfort.
\"We mobilize this country's people's army that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will never calm down until we become an independent, self-governed, proud United Kingdom.\"
Meanwhile, exit workers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists were waving the banners of Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit) following the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adanis has been facing off over the Conservatives over security concerns they faced due to a party programme when the conference opened.
\"These are people who tell us that they may have ready to use the IT system and all technology for Canada plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland,\" he added.
\"It's full farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit.'\" he added.
Warren plans to turn the sawpoint on the bolting process to the presidency]
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the election in November, she will \"turn a drinking attention to the process of bottling for the presidency.\"
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts State told his future during a general assembly in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is going to go for re-election, and she is opposed by Republican Party member Jeff Diehl, who was the co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of discussions as a possible rival to Trump in 2020.
Since Trump's entry into office, this was already the 36th meeting with voters in a general assembly format held Saturday afternoon in Halioke.
One of the participants asked if she planned to bat for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for \"women to go to Washington to amend the broken government, and for that, a woman should be led.\"
Arrest occurred after the death of basketball player Sims from Louisiana State University team
Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder of U.S. basketball player Wade Sims on Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rouge police management announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ditton Simpson during a press conference held at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
On Friday, they published a videotape of the shooting asking them to help recognize the person who was figureing on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
\"Wade Sims received a gunshot wound to the head as a result of which he died,\" said Channel 247sports chief of police, Murphy J. Paul, on Saturday.
Wade interceded for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the course of the interrogation, Simpson confessed to being at the scene of the crime, being armed and fired at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist at the arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Authority.
A Junior athlete growing 6 feet, 6 rebounds (201 cm) grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played in 32 games, of which 10 were on course from the start, averaged 17.4 minutes on course, throwing 5.6 points and committing 2.9 picks per game.
Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton came close to the world championship title after a win over Sebastian Fetelle by intra team deal
From the moment Valteri Botas got ahead on Saturday at the qualifying drive of Luis Hamilton, it became clear that the ordinances inside the Mercedes team would play a significant role in the race.
Botas pulled out a good place on the lots and almost left Hamilton free of fortune while he defended his place on the first two vires and invited Fetel to attack his friend on the team.
Fethel first got off to pit stops and left Hamilton bowled at the end of the overall mass of racers, it was this maneuver that had to become crucial.
The Mercedes pilot went onto the pit stop a lap later and came out behind Fetel, but Hamilton stepped forward after several wheel-in-wheel maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inner space free, risking a hold after a double maneuver to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Ferstappen, on his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the net and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
He then lined most of the race while he held tyres because he wanted to finish quickly, overtake Kimi Raikanen and take fourth place.
As a result, he went to the pit stop on lap 44, but was unable to increase speed on the remaining eight laps, so Raikanen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Valteri had all weekend speaking fantastically and expressed to himself a real gentleman when I would be allowed to speak so.
\"The team has done an outstanding job to take the first and second place,\" commented Hamilton.
It was a truly bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Finestein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted that she was not the source of the leak of a letter to Christina Blaisy Ford in which she accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavan of having sexual violence.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not appeal directly to the indications given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be \"slow, disgusting and untrue\".
\"The only thing that can happen and the kind of beautiful thing that's going on in the last few days in the Senate is if you see anger when you see evil, brittle and lying people,\" he said.
\"When you read about press releases and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
It's not me.\"
Remember?
Diana Finestein, is this your leak?
Do you remember her answer... you lost the document - \"ow, oh, what?\"
No, no.
There was nothing from me.\"
Wait-for-a minute.
We let the leak...No, we weren't allowed,\" he added, parading senator.
Finestein sent a letter in July detailing the charges brought by Ford against Cavan, and he escaped in early September. â but Finestein denied that the leak had taken place from her office.
\"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't let the leaks of her story,\" said Finestein to the committee, reported The Hill.
\"She asked that the story remain confidential and I granted her request.\"
But her denial probably didn't like the President, who commented so on it during a Saturday rally, \"Here's what I'll tell you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.\"
While continuing to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
\"They are full of determination to regain power themselves by any means.
You see the floor, the mersote, and they don't care who they wound, through whom they're going to have to transpose to gain power and control,\" conveys the President's words. \"Mediaite.\"
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Jayants 5-3
Patrick Douayer scored two shibs for Jayants in a match against Dundee
Dundee Stars played for the Friday defeat that they had inflicted on Belfast Jayants as part of the Elite League, winning the return match 5-3 in a home match on Saturday.
Thanks to a hit by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauville, Jayants were leading by two shibs at the start.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney leveled the number before Douyer restored Jayants' lead.
FranÃ§ois Bouchard of Dundee levelled the score, followed by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals securing the team's victory.
This became the third collapse in the Elite League in a season for Adam Kiff's team, who beat Dundee 2â1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
The teams met for the fourth time in a season; in the previous three games, Jayants swept.
The first goal on the fourth minute of the match (03:35) was scored by Douyer from Kendall McFool's submission, and four more minutes later, Bavillier doubled the score after a David Rutherford submission.
In a lively first period (13:10), Sullivan opened the number by field stewards and then Kaun levelled the number after Matt Marquardt's transfer (15:16).
Douayer secured Jayants leadership as he left for the first break, killing his second shiba for the meeting at the end of the first period.
Taking the side regrouped, and Bouchard again leveled the account, killing the shiba at the team's numerical advantage (27:37).
Kaun and Charles Carcoran helped Nielsen bring Dandy out in the lead for the first time for the match at the end of the second period, and he secured a victory along with the team's fifth in the middle of the last period.
The Jayants, who have already lost four of their last five meetings, will play the last match at the home ground against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Airman dies saving hundreds of passengers from earthquake\"
An airman in Indonesia hero died, ensuring a successful take-off of the plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared without news after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, which triggered a tsunami.
Strong underground jolts are still ongoing, and many people are buried under debris in the town of Palu.
Although his colleagues were rescued by escape, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a dispatch effort that ducked wildly at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained in place until the 6321 Batik Air Company, which was at that point on the runway, blew off the ground.
He then jumped out of the dispatch pitch when he decided she was breaking up.
He later died in a hospital.
As reported by Australia's ABC News program, according to Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Searight, the dispatcher's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter flew to Palu.
\"Our hearts are broken,\" he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities fear that the number of casualties could reach several thousand, and the agency to mitigate the dangers of natural disasters says that access to the city of Dongala, Sigi and Button is limited.
A spokesman for the Sutopa Purva Nugroha Agency reported, \"Perhaps the number of casualties will still increase, as many bodies have still failed to dig off from under the wreckage.\"
Waves reaching up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive funeral would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are doubling humanitarian aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, reported to Sky News, \"Every minute a machine--fucking is to bring bodies.
Clear water is lacking.
They rob stores everywhere.\"
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, reported to CNN, \"The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who survived, but we don't know what's waiting for them here.
It's already a tragedy, but everything can become much worse.\"
Indonesian President Jock Widoda arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the military, \"I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?' Â» reports Â»CNN\".
Earlier this year, Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes in Lamboka, with over 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: according to Air Niugini one person missing without news after spinning the plane in a lagoon]
The airline, which was carrying out a flight that made an emergency landing at a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and the team were happily evacuated from the plane that melted and now claims missing without the news of one passenger.
The Air Niugini company said in a press release that as of Saturday day it could not report the location of one male passenger.
The airline reported that she was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately report details on the passenger; for example its age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the remaining passengers and the team after landing the plane on water in an attempt to land at Chuvk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people were trapped in the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday; all of them were in stable condition.
The reason for the cruising as well as the exact sequence of events remains unexplained.
According to statements from both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in a lagoon without flying to the landing strip.
According to reports from some witnesses, the plane sped through a landing strip.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
\"It's very successful,\" Janes reported.
According to him, he and others were able to make their way through the belt in the water to the plane's emergency exits, which had already melted.
He said the onboarders were intoxicated and started screaming, as well as that he had sustained a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors ramming nearby the wharf also assisted in the rescue by using the overpowered boat to transport people ashore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died while cruising registered aircraft in Papua New Guinea over the past twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
The analyst resumes the course of events on the night a woman was burned by a liver]
On Saturday, the indictment concluded presenting evidence in a review of the case of a man who is accused of burning a resident of Mississippi State in 2014.
United States Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulet gave indications for hours as an expert involved in the area of information analysis.
He described to jurors how he used cell phone records to recapture the movements of 29-year-old respondent Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, according to Roulette, he received information about the location from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, contradicting his past statements.
When given that his cell phone was next to Chambers' phone at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford confirmed, police were on their way to ask Sanford.
Sanford gave the indications on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the prosecution if Tellis was telling the truth about that Senford was in the van that evening, he stated that he was \"fooling, since my van was in Nashville.\"
Another contradiction was Tellis' claim that he was familiar with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Recordings from mobile phones indicated they knew each other all week.
According to Roulette, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed her messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
\"He erased her from his life,\" said Haley.
The defence side is to begin disputes by the parties on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be handed down for jury consideration later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio intends to challenge the negative view of this genre by filling their music with positive installments.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, states that hip hop has distanced itself from its origins: political statements and sharp-social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Akala and Lowkey have returned collectives such as The Fugees and Common to popularity in the UK.
Another blackout?!
Nanny of New York falls to court for married couple for 'racist' message after dismissal\"
Nanny of New York is sued by a married couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving an accidentally sent message from her mother with a complaint that she is \"another blackout\".
The couple denies that they are racist, likening the pose to \"profoundness\".
In 2016, Linsey Plasca-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment, finding that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was a blacksmith when she arrived on her first working day.
\"NEEEEEEE, JASHE ADNA CHARNASKURAY,\" wrote Mrs. Plasca-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent the message to Miss Morris twice.
As the New York Post reports, after realizing the mistake was \"feeling awkwardly\" Plask-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also African-American, had been ill-treated by the job, and that she had been waiting for a Filipino instead.
Ms Morris paid a day to work and sent home to Uber.
Morris now falls for the couple in court and wants to get compensation for dismissal in accordance with the conditions she was originally hired on, albeit without a contract: $350 a day for six months with residency.
\"I want to show them what it is not possible to do so,\" she reported to the Post on Friday. \"I know it's discrimination.\"
The couple retaliated on accusations of racism, claiming that Morris' dismissal was a reasonable decision, given what they could not trust her, after insulting her.
\"My wife sent her what she shouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,\" reported \"Post\" husband, Joel Plasca.
\"And you would have trusted your children back with whom you went around rudely, let even by accident?
Your fiancÃ©?
Nope?\"
Plasca equates the pose to \"promotion\" and reports that his wife gave birth just two months ago and was in a \"very difficult situation\".
\"And will you become pursuing a man in that position?
It's pretty tough,\" added an investment and banking specialist.
Although court proceedings are still ongoing, public opinion quickly condemned the married couple on social networks, subject to sharp criticism of their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not super-live the bear talking, said in a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, wrote of the letter: \"It is hard to put herself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
So chiseled it to read, already aware of Paddington's immense success.\"
She told her father, who worked as a BBC operator before he ventured to write a book for children about the little toy bear, was optimistic despite his work not being accepted and added that the 60th anniversary of publishing the books was \"horror-sweet\" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success, saying of Paddington, whom she describes as \"a very important member of our family\".
\"He was a rather quiet man, and not at all exhilarating,\" she told.
\"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost a parental honor for a child which had made something: you proud of them, though in fact it is not your merit.
I think he was considering Paddington's success exactly in that key.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave his proper to Paddington himself.\"
My daughter was dying, and I had to part with her on the phone]
After landing, her daughter was delivered to the Nice Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
\"Beyond regularly called to tell us that everything is really bad, that it will not endure,\" said Mrs Ednan-Laperousa.
\"Then I called Over to say she would die for the next two minutes and I had to say farewell to her.
And I did it.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll soon be with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave to trouble her heart were slowly leaving her body.
She died some time ago, and that was the very end.
I just had to sit there knowing there was everything unfolding.
I couldn't either groan, nor scream, nor cry, for there were families and people around me.
I needed to hold on to-\"
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was experiencing the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers . . . and they didn't know at all what she had to go through.
\"No one knew,\" she said.
\"I bent my head and across my face all the time the tears flowed.
It's hard to explain, but it was in flight that I was caught up in Ned's sense of compassion.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her.\"
Women who grieve wind up cards to warn suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost their dear people who have committed suicide do everything to keep other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys hang out the cards on with warm words and phone numbers on which people can get help, on a bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he had depression, and at 18, he committed suicide.
\"I don't want other parents to feel like the way I feel,\" she said.
45-year-old Mistress Davis, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a talented chef with a contagious smile.
\"Everybody knew his smile.
People said his smile would enlighten any room.\"
However, he quit his job before he died because he was \"in a very dark place\".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis says, \"I constantly worry that this may be a nasty consequence.\"
Mrs. Davis created the cards, \"to whom people knew there were such persons in the world as you can turn to and talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don't stay in silence - you need to talk.\"
Mrs. Hasfrees, who is friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
\"He didn't say he was bored, or that he was depressed, or something like that,\" she said.
\"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On a holiday day, he was very depressed: when children opened presents, he didn't even look at them.\"
She said his death was a major injury to them, but had to live with this: \"There was a huge hole in the family.
It just kills us.
But you have to keep living and fighting.\"

The future Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain because the FBI is launching an investigation]
\"I thought that we could have what he wants - limited in time and in coverage of the investigation - we could get a little union -\" said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was incapacitated that the committee was \"disturbing\" because it actually got into the sample.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance is explained sometimes.
Interim elections just five weeks later, on November 6 - when Republicans are expected to shake up the collapse, then they will be weakened in their attempts to choose to the supreme court the candidate they need.
George Bush called a senator to placate the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during the Bush presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then working as Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats now sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh would receive at least 50 votes during the Senate vote, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem of voting equality and approve it to the Supreme Court.
The number of transgressors from North Korea fell while leading Kim
The number of transgressors from North Korea to South has fallen since Kim Cheng Yin came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Pak Bo Sun, bringing South Korea's Ministry of Unification data, said there were 1,127 hurdles last year, and 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Pak said that the main reasons were the enhanced border control between North Korea and China and the higher costs that smugglers set up for the refit.
Pyongyang has not commented on this in any way.
Most passers-by from the north over why they receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that over 30,000 residents of North Korea illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China with which North Korea has the longest limit.It is more simply to be crossed than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very heavily guarded.
China sees the transgressors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in a state of war - have improved greatly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks concerning denuclearization.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Cheng Yin in Singapore in June, when they agreed in general terms to work to fully relieve the Korean Peninsula nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yan Ho accused American sanctions of lack of progress since then.
\"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions we are not going to disarm first,\" said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh \"hysteric\", she says he shouldn't work for the Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh \"hysteric\" and said that at his temperament he was not fit to work for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Edition Festival in Austin, Texas.
\"I couldn't get rid of the thought that if that's how a woman behaved, she'd be called a 'hysteric-'\" led Pelosi about his reaction to Kavanaugh's speech before the Senate Law Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionalized charges of sexual harassment against Dr. Christina Blazy Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and could not speak when his family and senior school classes were discussed.
He also explicitly accused Democrats of the committee, calling the charges against him a \"grotesque and organized personality murder\" organized by liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's performance showed he could not work in the Supreme Court because he clearly indicated he had a bias against Democrats.
\"I believe he disqualified himself by his statements and by what manner he spoke of Clinton and the Democrats,\" she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked if she would attempt to impeach Kavanaugh if he was elected and if the Democrats would receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
\"I'll say yes - if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or in the FBI, he doesn't just have to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,\" said Pelosi.
At the moment, Cavanaugh is judge of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelozzi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she would be incapacitated by Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the available medicine law or in the case of Rowe v. Wade because Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the approval hearings in office, Kavanaugh did not answer questions whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
\"Now is not the time for hysterical, non-objective individuals to work in court and to expect words from us - as it is wonderful -\" said Pelosi.
And a woman should be able to do that.
It's a justified accusation speech, months and years of anger just transfused, and she can't contrive it without tears.
\"We're crying when we're angry,\" 45 years ago told me Mrs. Steinem.
\"I don't think it's that rare.\"
She continued, \"I was very much helped by a woman who worked as a director somewhere, and who said that when she was angry, she cried but produced behavior techniques. as she got angry and started crying, she said to co-conspirators, 'Perhaps you think I'm bored because I'm crying.
But I'm angry.\"
And just kept talking.
I believe it was great.\"
Tears are allowed in part as an outing of the amount because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from the first work at which I once cried of unspoken malice, then me for the collar grabbed an elderly woman  â a restrained superior who had me always a little fervent  â and dragged me to the steps.
\"Never let you be seen in tears,\" she said.
\"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're bored and they'll be happy to let you in.\"
Patricia Schroedar, at the time a Democrat congressman from the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt fell on marriage treason on a yacht called Monkey Business and walked out of the presidential race, the very angry Mrs. Schroedar thought she and herself might be a member of the presidential campaign.
\"It wasn't a very well thoughtful decision,\" she laughed at her 30 years later.
\"There were seven other candidates and I was totally unnecessary to them.
Someone called this situation \"Believe and seven dwarves.\"
Since the campaign had already been going for quite some time, it lacked the funds, so she said she would not take part in the election unless she was running for $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
Turns out that some of her supporters who sacrificed $1,000 to the men gave her only $250.
\"They think I'm going with a dump?\" she thought.
When she made a statement that she would not be involved in the election campaign, she was so heavily adored by the emotions of the - thanks to the people who supported her, malice on the system that made it so difficult to get money and aimed at voters rather than candidates, and anger at sexism  - that she had overtaken her breath.
\"You could think I had a nervous breakdown,\" recalled Mistress Schroedar's response to the press to her condition.
\"It may have been thought that my corporate sponsor is paper server manufacturer Kleenex.

Why the trade war between China and the United States might be good for Beijing
The first flaps of the trade war between China and the United States were deafening, and since the war is far from over, in a more far-reaching perspective, misunderstandings between countries may be for Beijing's benefit, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump shot the first warning at the start of this year, lining up taxes to China's major export goods, including solar panels, steel, and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week when new tariffs affected goods for a total of $200 billion ($150 billion), effectively lining up taxes on half of the goods coming into the United States from China.
Each time Beijing responded in this very way by raising recently tariffs from five to ten percent on American goods at a cost of $60 billion.
China has pledged the United States a symmetrical response, and the second largest economy is hardly eye to lead.
To force Washington to retreat, one must deepen in demand, but the public leaning in front of the United States is virtually unacceptable to Chinese leader Xi Jinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing correctly uses the situation, U.S. trade war pressures can support China in a far long run, reducing the mutual dependence of these two countries.
\"The fact that a quick political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will begin the process of a drastic economic fall is far more dangerous than observers thought before,\" said Ebigail Grace, an assistant researcher specializing in Asia, at the research and analysis center for new American security.
Syria 'hot' to return refugees, says foreign minister\"
Syria states that it is ready to return refugees and calls for help to rebuild a war-ravaged country that has lasted for over seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions in the country were improving.
\"The situation in the country today is more stable and safer, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for returning refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and directed economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN believes that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Six million more living in the country require humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept help to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept assistance in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from countries sponsored by the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the American team 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The United States has already lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back when Danish captain Thomas BjÃ¸rn's team scored 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought most in the tournament, drove his ball into the water on 3 pairs of 16th Hole, giving up that match to Francesco Malinari.
Italian golfer Malinari played excellently in all rounds, being made one of four players who went through this field with a 5-0-0 from the start of the Tunisian in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spies was knocked out with a 5 and 4 player with the lowest ranking on the European team, ThornbjÃ¸rn Olsen of Denmark.
World's top scorer Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Rydar Cups Spanish Sergio GarcÃ­a made himself a player who has more than all wins in the tournament with a career-high 25.5 points.
\"Certainly I don't cry, but I can't hold on today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
The whole thing about the team, and I'm glad I could help it,\" said a shaken Garcia after winning the European team.
He handed the Estate to his compatriot John Ram, who played the legend of American golf Tyger Woods in single 2&1 matches on Sunday.
\"I'm very proud to have won in Tyger Woods, a man whose career has been followed since childhood,\" said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four uterus in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
The surprising statistics of one of the greatest players of all time to have won 14 major titles and stand down on that score only from Jack Niklaus.
The American team struggled with themselves with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tnie Finns, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game in defense of his team, \"I'm proud of these guys, they're fighters.
That morning we sometimes showed Europe what we were capable of.
We fought.
Take down the hats in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We regroup, I will work with the Golf Association of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud I'm their captain.
Take your hat off in front of them.
We were overplayed.\"
