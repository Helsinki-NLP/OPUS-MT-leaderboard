With me, fortunately, nothing happened, but I had to watch the awful scene — people to get out the weather have broken windows.
People tried to break windows using stools, but these windows were unbittered.
According to the stricken Franciszek Koval, \"one of the Shibs did not last endure, and people began to pick through the window.\"
The stars emit heat and light thanks to the energy produced when hydrogen atoms combine (or merge), resulting in more severe elements.
At the present time, scientists are conducting work on the development of the reactor, which would be capable of producing energy in a similar way.
But it's a very difficult task, and it will take many more years before it's adventurous to operate a thermonuclear synthesis reactor.
Due to surface shading, a steel needle can swim on the surface of the water.
Surface shading occurs because the water molecules that are on its surface are strongly attracted to one another, and the power of the twilight between them is larger compared to the twilight to the air molecules on top.
The molecules of water form an invisible skin on its surface, thanks to why such things as the needle can be kept afloat.
On modern concaves, the blade has a double wastrio with an upturned hollow between the edges. This provides better contact with the ice, even if the canines are at an angle.
The lower part of the blade is slightly curved, so when the blade tilts, it also bends and its edge touches the ice.
Because of this, the figurehead does the twist. If the cane is tilted to the right, the figurist turns to the right. Accordingly, while tilting the canines to the left, he turns to the left.
To bring back the previous level of energy, they need to get rid of the excesses of energy obtained from the light.
For this, they release a tiny particle of light called a \"photon\".
The scientific name of this process is \"induced radiation emission\" because bright light stimulates atoms, there is the emission of a phantom of light, and light is one of the types of radiation.
You can see atoms that emit phantoms in the image below. In fact, the cane, the phantoms are much smaller than on the image.
The size of the phantoms is even smaller than that of the particles that form part of the atoms!
The thread of the lamp burns down after a hundred hours of work and the lamp stops glowing.
In this case, the lamp has to be swapped. If replaced, it needs to be careful.
First of all, you have to turn off the lighting device switch or turn off the cable.
The electricity going into the cartridge where the metal part of the lamp is located can cause a strong defeat by the electric current if you, while the lamp is in the cartridge, touch the inside of the cartridge or the metal base of the lamp.
The heart pumps blood and is the primary organ of the blood system.
Towards the heart, blood moves along vessels known as arteries, and towards the heart, following vessels known as veins.The smallest vessels are called capillaries.
Even very hard branches and roots (not just leaves) posed no problem for the teeth of the triceratops.
According to some scientists, triceratops could consume saggoons, a type of plant that were very common during the melee period.
These plants look like small palm trees with crowns of spiky sharp leaves.
Before eating the trunk, the triceratops could pluck the leaves using their powerful beak.
At the same time, other scientists state that these plants are very toxic, so it is unlikely for dinosaurs to eat them. and this is despite the fact that toxic leaves or fruit can be powered by sloths and second animals such as parrots (and it comes from dinosaurs today).
How will I have the gravity of Yo? Your weight on the surface of Yo would be less than on Earth.
A man of 200 pounds (or 90 kg) weight on Earth on Yo will weigh about 36 pounds (or 16 kg). So it is clear that gravity on Yo will affect things to a lesser extent.
In distinction from Earth, the sun has no solid surface on which to stand. the sun is entirely composed of fire, gases, and plasma.
The gas becomes increasingly diluted as it distances itself from the center of the sun.
The outer part of the sun we observe is a photosphere or in the translation of a \"sharp of light\".
In 1610, almost three thousand years later, the observation into the telescope behind Venus allowed the Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo to see that it was also like the moon having phases.
Enlightened only that side of Venus (albeit the moon) that is turned to the sun — in this reason, the phase change. The phases of Venus served as evidence of Copernicus' theory, which claimed that planets revolve around the sun.
In 1639, a few years afterwards, astronomer from England Jeremay Horax supervised the passage of Venus on the disk of the sun.
After the Danelagh was rejuvenated, peace was established at length in England.
Nevertheless, in 991, Ethelred was opposed by the Viking fleet.It was comparable to the size of the latter could only the Gutrum fleet a hundred years ago.
It was a fleet under the command of Norwegian Olaf Tryggwasson, who wanted to free his radium from Danish rule.
Ethelred managed to make a deal with Olaf after initial military failures, after which he returned to Norway to fight back his kingdom.In this case he was accompanied by a variable success.
Hangil is the only alphabet in the world to have been developed specifically, and which many people use daily.He appeared in 1444 when the ruler of the country was King Sejong (1418-1450).

He spelt gave the Hangil alphabet the name \"Hunmin Jongheim\".This in translation means \"the proper sounds for people to mentor\".
There are many theories that explain how and where Sanskrit came from. One of them claims it was the native Aryan language that moved to India from the west.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that can be compared to that used to be common in Europe of Latin.
The Sanskrit was written by the earliest of the books we know.After the Upanishads were composed, Sanskrit simply disappeared due to hierarchicality.
Sanskrit is a rich and very complex language based on which a number of modern dialects of India emerged, similar to how European languages, such as Spanish and French, developed from Latin.
After the battle for France ended, Germany began preparations to take over the United Kingdom.
Germany marked the attack with the code name \"Operation Sea Cat\".The majority of Britain's heavy weapons and army stockpiles were lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, which weakened the army enough.
But whatever the power of the Royal Navy was much more than that of the German Navy (which in German is called the \"Criegsmarine\"): he could destroy any attacking fleet heading through La Mansch.
At the same time, very few ships of the Royal Navy were based near the probable routes of the invasion, because the admirals feared their sinking by the German air force.
Let's explain Italy's plans first.This country was the \"young brother\" of Japan and Germany.
Despite four new ships being built before the very start of the war, her army and navy were weaker.
African countries were Italy's main target.It needed a launch site to capture these countries with which troops could sail the Mediterranean Sea and attack Africa.
To this end, they needed to get rid of the British bases and ships that were in Egypt. nothing other than this the Italian line ships had to do.
Now, it's about Japan. Just like the United Kingdom, Japan was an island state.
The submarines represent ships that were specially constructed to be moved underwater. They can be underwater for a long time.
The submarines were used both over the course of the First and Second World Wars.They were moving very slowly at the time, by the same time, the range of shootings in them was quite negligible.
When the war just started, they sailed, mainly on the surface of the sea. However, because the radars were perfected and made more accurate, the submarines had to swell under the water so that they could not be noticed.
German Submarines were called \"U-butt.\" The Germans had excellent skills in navigation and submarine management.
After the war, Germany was not allowed to have many submarines due to their successful use.
Yes! One of the most famous ancient Egyptian pharaohs today is Pharaoh Tutankhamun, and he is sometimes referred to as \"the pharaoh Tut\" or \"the pharaoh boy\".
What is interesting is that the ancient lists of kings did not contribute it because they thought it was not very important.
At the same time, after the site of his burial was found in 1922, he became famous. when many graves in the past had been robbed, his grave remained almost intact.
It is well preserved by most of the items that were buried with Tutankhamun. Thousands of artifacts from rare stones and precious metals can be mentioned among them.
Thanks to the invention of the wheels with the sleepers, the Assyrian chariots became more light, swift, and were able to hoist both soldiers and other chariots.
Shots from their deadly orblets were without trouble stabbing the success of enemy troops soldiers.Connica first appeared in Assyrians in approximately 1000 BCE.
Cavalry is a kind of troops fighting atop horses.The Assyrian horse fought by sitting directly on the backs of its horses because at the time the saddle had not yet been invented.
We are known for many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. perhaps Gamer, the legendary blind poet who created two masterpieces of Greek literature, Iliad and Adiseus, is the most famous representative of this culture.
Even today, popular playwrights remain Sophocles and Aristophanes, and their plays enter the treasury of world literature.
The Pythagoras mathematician also belongs to the number of known people from Greece.It has been celebrated mainly by the legendary theorem on the ratio of the sides of the rectangular triangle.
There are different opinions about how many people speak Hindi. By different accounts, this language is one of the first places in the world (between second and fourth) in terms of the number of people who speak it.
There are different estimates of the number of media in this language, depending on whether related dialects are taken into account.
The total media of this language in the world is estimated to be between 340 and 500 million, and another roughly 800 million people can understand it.
In Hindi and Urdu, a similar vacabular but different writing; the media of both languages in everyday conversations usually understand each other.
Somewhere in the 15th century, Germany exerted significant influence on the culture of northern Estonia.
German monks intended to draw the indigenous people closer to God, so it was because of them that Estonian literary language arose.
In its base lay the German alphabet, to which they added the letter \" -/õ\".
A lot of borrowed from the German language of words has merged into one whole over time. This is how the age of enlightenment began.

3% of the country comes from the European part of Turkey (this is Eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula).
Turkey is over 1,600 km (or 1,000 miles) long, and the width is about 800 km (or 500 miles).The country's territory resembles a rectangle.
783,562 square kilometers (or 300,948 square miles) - such an area is occupied by Turkey (considering lakes).There are 755,688 square kilometers (or 291,773 square miles) of the mentioned number and 23,764 square miles (or 9,174 square miles) on Europe.
Turkey ranks 37th in the world at its largest - its area is almost the metropolis of France and the United Kingdom together.
On three sides Turkey washes the seas: to the west, Aegean, to the north, Black, and to the south, Mediterranean.
Luxembourg did not gain independence until 1839, despite its entire long history.
The modern regions of Belgium formerly belonged to Luxembourg, but passed to Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s.
Luxembourg had always sought to maintain neutrality, yet the continuation of the First and Second World Wars it was under German occupation.
Luxembourg became one of the original founding members of the union in 1957, which everyone knows today under the name \"European Union\".
Drugiel Dzong represents the Buddhist monastery and ruins of the fortress, which is at the top of Paro district (if exact, in the village of Fondi).
It is believed that Jabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built up a fortress in 1649 to commemorate his own victory over the Tibetan-Mongol army.
As a result of the fire in 1951, only a few relics were left from Drukgyel Dzong, among which was the image of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was conserved and taken under guard. Even today, it still refers to the number of Bhutan's most splendid great places.
Cambodia had, for the 18th century, found itself stalled between Thailand and Vietnam, by two powerful neighbours.

To learn how to create an interactive environment, one must possess both relevant traditional skills and those that have been purchased on interactive occupations (to their number refers to the creation of rascals, sweeping and editing of audio materials and video materials, writing stories, etc.)
Interactive modeling requires you to review your submissions on how to prepare materials for the media and learn nonlinear thinking.
For the purposes of interactive design, it is necessary that the components of the project not only combine, but also make sense individually.
Objectives with variable focus distances have a specific disadvantage - in these compared to simple objects the focus complexity and number of elements the objective is needed to reach a certain range of focus distances is much larger.
The problem disappears because lens manufacturers reach increasingly higher standards in their manufacture.
Because of this, the quality of the photographs that could be taken using such zum objects could be compared to the quality of the photographs that were made by the objector with a fixed focus distance.
As a rule, the smaller maximum diaphragm (fastness) of the objective is another lack of zum-objectives.
For this reason, inexpensive zum-objectives are difficult to use without flashing when light is few.
The strip on-screen is one of the most frequent problems when you convert movies into a DVD format.
The design of the main mass of televisions is developed in such a way that it likes as many people as possible.
That's why there's always borders insulted on the TV picture — from above, down and down the sides.
This is done to make the image guaranteed to cover the screen entirely. Phenomenon has been called \"palace\".
As neither is sad, but, if you make a DVD, the boundaries of the image will most likely be circumscribed as well. Therefore, subtitles can only be seen in part when they were too close to the bottom of the screen.
Classical medieval castles have long been given space for fancy - they have borne images of knights' belts, banquets and forced memories of the legends of King Arthur.
It's easy to mention the sounds and smells of old-fashioned battles, it's almost heard banging hoofs down the buck and feeling afraid that you're climbing from an underground jail, even if you're just standing between a thousand-year-old ruins.
But how co-existing with reality is our imagination? Why built castles at all? how did they be designed and built?
Kirby Muxlo Castle — typical of this period — is a more fortified house than a real castle.
Hardly massive glass windows and fine castle walls could long contain a determined attack by the enemy.
When Lord Hastings began building it in the 1480s, the situation in the country was quite peaceful, and it was only necessary to defend itself from small groups of travelling marauders.
The equilibrium force became used as an instrument by which European countries were able to secure the national sovereignty of all the peoples of Europe.
The meaning of the concept was that all European countries were trying to prevent any one state from being strengthened.As a result, in order to maintain balance, national governments often joined different alliances.
The first war, whose main problem was the power ratio, was just the War of the Spanish Succession.
This became an important change as more European states had no reason to launch religious wars.At last, the last religious war was the Thirty Years' War.
As a result of the arson committed by Gerastratus, the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 BCE.
If you believe the falls, your aim was to know any price.The outraged Ephesians have declared that the name of Gerastratus will never be brought into the annals.
The Greek historian Strabo later mentioned his name - that is why we know him today. on the same night that Alexander the Great was born, the temple of Artemis was destroyed.
Alexander the Great made a truly royal gesture, offering to pay for the restoration of the temple, but his proposal was not accepted.The temple was restored in the 323rd century BCE, after Alexander's death.

Mysticism is an effort to connect with the ultimate reality, divinity, the spiritual truth either by God, to identify with them or to learn them.
The purpose of the believing ones is to obtain practical experience, to develop a spiritual vision, or to understand the essence of divine reality or the essence of desire.
Followers lead a certain lifestyle or engage in appropriate practices in order to enrich their own experience of that kind.
The difference between mysticism and other religious beliefs and cults is that in mysticism, the basic consideration is given to direct personal survival of a unique state of consciousness, particularly when this survival bears a peaceful, penetrating, blissful, or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism represents religion coming from the Indian subcontinent.It emerged in the 15th century in the Punjab region as a result of the emergence in Hinduism of various sectarian groups.
Despite the Sikhs' recognition of the Hindu roots and traditions of Sikhism, they still believe that their faith and Hinduism are distinct religions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, that in the Panjabi language means \"path of the guru\".In all Indian religions, the concept of guru is central and is of great importance, yet in Sikhism it has become so important that it represents a major component of Sikh beliefs.
The founder of religion in the 15th century was guru Nanak (1469-1539 AD).He was followed by nine more gurus in a row.
However, in June 1956, when riots in Poland, where workers protested against food deficits and reduced earnings, overturned with a general protest against communism, Khrushchev's promises were subjected to testing.
And although at last Khrushchev restored order in the country with the aid of tanks, nevertheless he went on some economic concessions and mentioned appointing the popular Vladislav Gamulka as the new Prime Minister.
Indus Civilization is a Bronze Age civilization.The habitat of the mentioned civilization was located in the northwest Indian subcontinent. much of the territory of modern Pakistan was referred to above the area, as well as separate regions in northeastern Afghanistan and northwestern India.
The mentioned civilization reached prosperity in the Indus River basin. It is from here that its name is derived.
Given that this civilization also existed in the basins of the dried Saraswati river, some scientists suggest that it should be properly called the Indo-Saraswak civilization. at the same time, some call it the Harap civilization in honor of the city of Harapa, the first excavations of which began in the 1920s.
Achievement in the area of medicine greatly contributed to the fact that the Roman Empire was a militaristic state.
Emperor Augustus was the first to begin hiring doctors for service.He even created the first Roman medical corps to provide medical care to those to suffer in future battles.
The surgeon is known for all sorts of painkillers, including morphine, which is derived from the extract of poppy seeds, and scapalomin from the extract of blotch seeds.
To rescue patients with gangrene, they learned to make amputations, and to stop bleeding, to put on jugs and arterial compressions.
In the field of medicine, the Roman Empire has made great strides for several centuries, and much of the knowledge we possess today, we owe it to it.
Simple origami represents an origami style in which only one fold can be made for one take. More complex folds such as reverse fold are not allowed. In this case, all of them are characterized by simple placement.
This technique was developed in the 1970s by John Smith, who sought to facilitate classes for involuntary origamists or people with limited parentage.
In children at quite a small age, there is a growing awareness of races and there are racial stereotypes that shape the type of behavior.
Children, for example, who identify themselves with such a racial minority whose representatives, according to the stereotype, are poorly taught in school as soon as they are aware of this racial stereotype tend to begin to learn badly at school.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States, with 54 million profiles registered today.
The websites mentioned have gained great popularity, mainly in the educational environment.
These websites have a number of positive features, among which the ability to easily customize a class page with blogs, videos, photographs, and other functions.
You can move on to this page by introducing just one web address. In this way, students who have difficulty using the keyboard, or who have problems with spelling, can remember it quickly and dial it.
It can be tuned in such a way that it can be read easily. In addition, you can choose the color gamma for it.
A attention deficit syndrome is \"a neurological syndrome whose three classic manifestations are pathological distraction, impulsivity, as well as excess amounts of energy (or hyperactivity).\"
This is a cognitive ability disorder, not a learning inability; it \"is met by 3 to 5 percent children, it is approximately 2 million all children in America.\"
Children with attention deficit syndrome are difficult to focus on, for example, school jobs, yet they are able to concentrate on things that they like. These may be favorite cartoons, games, or writing said without signs of suspension.
Given that these children's brains are impossible to stimulate conventional methods, they \"participate in risky behaviors, engage in fights, and challenge to authorities\", leading to a large number of problems.
A attention deficit syndrome affects relationships with peers because other children cannot understand why those suffering from SDU operate and write in the appropriate way, or why they have a different level of becoming.
The basic rate of knowledge gain has changed as a result of the aforementioned change in ability to get knowledge and learn.
Another was an approach to obtain information. Within the individual tests, there was no more compulsion to remember, but more attention began to be given to the ability to remember the text.
Essentially, the approach to learning and extending knowledge has largely changed in the Renaissance.
The hominids no longer use their hands to move, carry gravity, and groceries to trees - as opposed to other primates.
In size and length, the hand and foot of the chimpanzees are similar. This indicates that when walking with resistance on the fingers, hands were used to carry gravity.
The man's hand is not as long as the foot, and the phalangs on it are more straight.
The mentioned transition in the work of the hand from moving objects to performing operations indicates the fossils of the bones of the hands are between two and three million years old.
According to some people, many artificially induced conscious dreams may be parteder heavily decapitated.
This phenomenon is explained mainly by the fact that during conscious dreams increases the period between fast sleep phases.
If you have less fast sleep phase over night, the condition in which you really sleep, and your body recovers, becomes not frequent enough, and that represents a problem.
It is no less obtuse than to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes to see anything by TV.
The effect is influenced by the frequency with which your brain over night is trying to see conscious dreams.
Almost at the outset of the Italians' affairs in North Africa did not materialize. after the declaration of war by Italy on 10 June 1940, the British 11th Hussar Regiment captured the Libyan fort of Capuzzo.
The British staged an ambush towards the east of Bardia and captured General Lastucci, who was the chief of engineering troops of Italy's tenth army.
The Governor-General of Libya and the apparent successor of Musalini, Marshal Itala Balbo died during the landing in Tobruk under shelling leading his troops.This was June 28.
Modern fencing is done at many levels. They are done by university students and professional athletes. Furthermore, it is part of the Olympic program.
In this sport, it is mostly like a duel: one fencingman competes with another.
Golf is a game in which players kill swords in the bows, using special knuckles for this.
This is a typical batch of players passing eighteen bows. The game generally starts at first and ends at the eighteenth hole on the field.
The win will be won by that golfer who needs to make the least kicks or swings by a knuckle to pass the whole field.
This game runs on a grass-covered field. Around the bow, grass is coiled shorter, and this place itself is called \"grin\".
The most popular of tourism is probably leisure tourism: what the vast majority of people relate to travel.
It is at such a moment that people are sent to rest and have fun in a place that has nothing to do with their everyday lives.
Most commonly, tourists who want to relax and rest a little bit visit such standard places as beaches, attraction parks, and campsites.
If a person visiting some particular place aims to study his history and culture before him, it is cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit various fine places and attractions of one specifically taken country or pay special attention to only one region or area.
Watching all that is happening, the colonists also caused the dungeon.
The 1st and 3rd Regiments of the State of New Hampshire were part of the troops that provided the anchoring of forward positions. each regiment had 200 men.They were commanded by Colonels John Stark and James Reid, who later became generals.
Stark's people placed themselves from the northern edge of the colonists positions along the garden.
After the cast opened access to the gap along the Mystic River along the peninsula's northeast coast, they sparked the fence, building a short stone wall that continued and ended on a small beach at the edge of the water.
At a distance of about 100 feet (30 m) from the Gridley or Stark Gardens, they put up a sixth and ordered no one to shoot until regular troops pass it.
The simultaneous coordinated attacks from three different sides were part of the American plan.
To prevent the dusk of the fortifications, General John Cadwelder moved to join the British garrison at Bordentown.
After transporting across the river to Trenton Ferry 700 gunmen, General James Ewing captured a bridge across Asunpink Creek and prevented enemy troops from escaping.
The main strike group, comprising 2,400 men, was to travel nine miles north of Trenton across the river, then split into two groups under the command of Sullivan and Greene and, before dawn, attack the enemy.
When going from a quarter mile to half mile distance, speed loses its importance, the obscure absolute necessity becomes durability.
Of course, the first-class runner at half-mile must not only have enough speed to run distance in less than two minutes, but also keep endurance and stamina at any danger.
The best preparation for a new running season in winter is cross-countrying along with exercises for the top of the body in a sports hall.
One only correct food does not guarantee high scores, however it can significantly improve the health condition of young athletes as a whole.
Improve your indicators, get more satisfaction from sports athletes will help maintain good energy balance, effective fluid level refueling habits, and understanding different aspects of food gain.
Run at mid-distances is a comparatively inexpensive sport. Still there are many misconceptions about the sports inventory that we need to have to compete in.
Things can be gained when need arises in them, but they mostly do not affect the result either of this influence will be almost unnoticed.
Athletes may prefer any product, even if one has no real value.
One might think that the atom is one of the fundamental building bricks of which all matter is composed.
The atom represents a rather complex object. according to a simplified boron model, there is a nucleus in its center, in the orbits around which electrons move. The latter is something like planets spinning around the sun (see Image 1.1.)
The two particles form the nucleus, protons and neutrons.
While neutrons have no charge, protons have a positive electrical charge. electrical charge of electrons is negative.
First you have to carefully learn the place of happening to make sure you have your own safety, and only then look around the affected one.
As you approach the victim, you need to pay attention to her position and the presence of suspicious signals.
If you get injured when you're helped, it can only make everything more difficult.
According to the study, it was determined that fear, depression, and catastrophysis were a link between pain and disability of patients suffering from pain in the lower back section.
Not depression and fear, but solely catastrophization and its consequences included regular weekly structured sessions across the PA.
People engaged in physical exercises on a regular basis needed greater support in that there was a negative perception of pain to learn how to distinguish chronic pain from discomfort driven by exercise.
The vision or ability to see is influenced by the sensory organs of the visual system, or, otherwise speaking, the eyes.
There are many different eye structures that vary in their complexity, which is implied by the demands of the organism.
Various features, varying degrees of ostripe, and sensitivity to different wavelengths are distinctive for different designs. Additionally, different methods of processing and different parameters are provided for analysis of input data to provide optimal functioning.
The population is a set of individuals of some particular species that exist inside a separately taken geographical region.
If all population members have the same phenotypic characteristics, they are called monomorphic ones.
Population members are polymorphic insofar as they have different variants of some particular trait.
In the same way, the journeys and nesting of colonies of duck ants occur in different phases.
During ducking, the travelling ants are moved at night, and the afternoon stops for rest.
The nomadic phase in the colony begins when the supplies of food available are reduced.The current phase of the colony makes temporary nests and changes them each day.
Each of these duckings or marches lasts for about 17 days.
What is a cell? the word itself begins from the Latin \"cella\", meaning \"little room.\"It was first introduced into the use of microscopyists, which studied the structure of the wood crust.
A cage is a major element of all living beings, and they all consist of a single cell or larger number of them.
To study the life of the cells, it is of basic and so great importance that they are rarely referred to as the \"building material of life\".
By sending nerve impulses throughout the body, the nervous system provides unhindered blood pressure and thereby supports homeostasis.
Nervous impulses help the body to safeguard itself from any possible threat thanks to being passed down the target very quickly.
Compared to other severe storms, tornadoes are raging in a small area, yet they are able to destroy literally everything in their path.
The tornado rips trees with roots, plucks out of buildings shingles and advertising shields and lifts into the sky of the machine.Two percent of the most destructive tornadoes are able to buoy over three hours.
Wind speeds in these terrible storms reach 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles per hour).
Increased lenses have been manufactured and used by humans for many thousands of years.
The foot full-length telescopes nevertheless only appeared in Europe under the curtain of the 16th century.
Two lenses were used in such telescopes so that one could get closer, increase and view distant objects.
Humanity will always be greedy and selfish, and the nature of cooperation is that if the majority benefit from anything, then in a short-term perspective you can always get more gainability if you act solely in your own interest.
It only remains to hope — people for the most part of their comfort — that cooperation is the best option in the long-term perspective.
Many dream that there will be a day where people will be able to set sail for other stars and study second peace.Some wonder what is there, some believe in alien or life on second planets.
However, if it really happens someday, then it's probably still very much to no speed.The stars are at such a great distance of one another that even between \"neighborhoods\" trillions of miles.
Perhaps your great-grandsons will one day reflect on their ancient ancestors by standing somewhere on top of an alien world?
Animal organizations are a bunch of trillion cells. They are powered by different things that are digested inside of them.The majority of animals are able to move.
Only animals have a brain (though not all; yes, for example, jellyfish don't have it).
The animals can be found in any corner of the planet. They swarm walk in the ground, swim in the water, and fly in the air.
The cell is the smallest functional and structural unit of any living organism.
The word \"cell\" (cell) was formed from Latin cella, i.e., \"little room\".
You will see that living creatures consist of little squares or balls when you try to view them under a microscope.
Using a microscope, Robert Hooke, an English biologist, saw little squares in the bark.
They were like a room. Hook was the first person to be able to see dead cells.
Connections and elements are able without alteration to move from one state to another.
And nitrogen gas, and liquid nitrogen have the same properties.The fluid is tighter, but these are the same molecules.
Another example can serve water. as part of water as a chemical compound includes two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Even when you go into a gas-like, liquid or solid state, it retains the same molecular structure.
Its chemical condition remains unchanged, even when it changes physical stan.
Time always surrounds us and affects all our actions. Despite this, it is difficult to understand.
Acts of religion, philosophy, and science have studied time for thousands of years.
According to our sensations, time is a series of events that, through modern times, move into the past from the future.
In addition, time is something we compare the length of events with.
Watching the repetition of a cyclic event, you can note on your own the course of time. The cyclic event represents an event that regularly takes place over and over again.
Computers can be used today to process photographs and video rolls.
Complex animation, which is increasingly used in television and film, is created using computers.
Complex computers are often used when recording music for processing and mixing sounds.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, we thought Māori were the first inhabitants of New Zealand.They hunted great birds known as moa.
Later, a theory was born that claimed as if the Māori people had sailed from Polynesia on the Great Fleet, wiped out the Marir people from New Zealand, and created an agrarian society on this land.
However, when you believe the new data, the Māoris were a group of Māori from the \"Great Land\" who influenced the Chatham Islands from New Zealand.They developed their own unique peaceful culture.
Another tribe inhabited the Chatham Islands.These were Māori from New Zealand who moved here.
\"Mariori\" — that's what they called themselves, there were several encounters, but at the end of the moriori were destroyed.
People who took part in this work over several decades helped us better understand our own advantages and inclinations and at the same time honestly appreciate complex moments and even failings.
Listening to the stories of people about them themselves, their families, and the organizations they work in, we got valuable information about the past and about some people, thanks to which changes in the culture of the organization took place both in the good and the bad side.
Understanding culture does not necessarily go near understanding history, yet it helps people to understand what place in the history of organization they occupy.
In the process of assessing the successes and analyzing failures, participants both individually and all together more deeply know the values of the organization, its mission, and their moving forces.
In this case, people were open to change and new areas of local church activity because they remembered earlier entrepreneurial behavior and consequential success.
The mentioned stories of success contributed to a decline in fear of change and created positive prerequisites for future change.
General thinking is the methods of solving problems and challenges in which finding a solution is done in various fields and using different ideas.
This type of thinking is characterized by speed, logic, precision, fact recognition, reuse of existing methods, and data collection.
The most important feature of this type of thinking is that the correct answer can only be one.There are only two answers — right and wrong.
This type of thinking is most often found in people whose scope is related to certain scientific or typical processes or procedures.
Logical thinking is characteristic of people with this type of thinking; they can remember completeness, solve tasks, and conduct scientific research.
Definitely, people have scored more success in \"reading thoughts\" of others than second species.
This means that we are able to successfully crave other people's sensations, intentions, hopes, knowledge, and desires.
The most important of these abilities is understanding the intentions of others because it allows us to exclude any potential vagueness in case of physical action.
Yeah, if you have to see someone smashing your booze in a car, you'll most likely decide that this person is trying to steal someone else's car.
However, when he lost his keys to his own car and tried to get into his own car, your guess would not match the actuality.
MRI is a technology based on a physical phenomenon known as nuclear-magnetic resonance (JMR).It was discovered by Felix Bloch (Stenford University) and Edward Persell (Harvard University) in the 1930s.
Magnetic field and radio waves force atoms during this resonance to generate weaker radio signals.
In 1970, Raimand Domandjian, a medical doctor, scientist and researcher, realized how magnetically-resonant tomography in medicine could be used to diagnose diseases.
Four years after this, the world's first patent in the MRI branch was issued.
Dr. Damadjian completed the construction of the first MRT scanner \"for the whole body\" in 1977.This scanner received the nickname \"Unbreakable\" from the scientist.
With asynchronous interaction, we need more time to comprehend and react.
Because of this, students have the ability to work at their own pace, as well as control the rate of input and processing of learning information.
In addition, this method provides for less time constraints, and also allows for the work of gibka graphs (Bremer, 1998)
Because of the Internet and the World Wide Web, scientists can search or receive information at any time.
In addition, instead of waiting for the next personal meeting, students can ask questions at any time to teachers — and in most cases they get the answer quite quickly.
There is no good way to learn why. A postmodernist approach to adopt new knowledge.
In fact, there are many things that should be studied.Learning takes place through experience between existing knowledge and the pupil.
This is corroborated by our available experience of interacting with all learning television shows from the \"make yourself\" category and information programs.
How often do we watch television shows where it comes to any process or experience we will never take part in and we know of which we will never need to.
We are hardly ever going to do a capital car repair or build a fountain in the back yard.We will never go to Peru to study ancient ruins or rebuild a neighbor's house.
Thanks to the underwater fibre-optic cables and broadband satellite communications conducted from Europe, 93 percent of Greenland's population has access to the Internet.
Most of the time at your hotel or to your landlords (if you stop at a guest or private house) will be wai-fai or connected to the internet by a computer, and an internet cafe or location with available wai-fai is at all locations.
As has already been noted, despite the United States' word \"Eskimos\" remaining acceptable, many Arctic peoples outside of the United States (especially in Canada) consider it degrading.
Although the word mentioned is used among the indigenous population of Greenland, foreigners do not welcome this.
In Canada, natives of Greenland call themselves Inuit, and in Greenland, they call themselves \"calalek\" (responsibly, in plural, \"calalit\").This means \"resident of Greenland\" or \"grenlander\".
Crimes and hostility in the address of foreigners as a whole is a phenomenon that is virtually not found in Greenland.Dangerous criminal districts are not even in cities.
The only real danger a untrained person can face is cold weather.
If you intend to visit Greenland in a cold couple of years you need to take enough warmer clothes with you (with regard to what's next north you're going to be, the colder you're going to be there).
Because there are very long days here in summer, sleep deficit-related problems as well as other health problems may arise.
We also have to remember northern mosquitoes in the summer. Although they are not disease carriers, they can touch heavily.
San Francisco's economy focuses on the fact that the city is popular among tourists a world-level attraction. at one time it is diversified.
The most significant areas of employment are owned by the professional services sector, tourism, trade, the financial sector, and the government.
This city and its sign places became famous worldwide because of their frequent reflection in music, films, literature and popular culture.
There are many opportunities for tourism in San Francisco - here the numberless hotels, restaurants and first-class conference centers.
In addition, San Francisco is one of the best places in the country where other cuisines of the peoples of Asia can be asked: Thai, Korean, Indian and Japanese.
For many American families, travelling to Disney Ward is an important pilgrimage.
Arriving at Orlando International Airport, the bus to Disney's Hotel, the week at the site without going beyond Disney's facilities and returning home - here's what a \"typical\" visit means.
There are an infinite number of possible choices, yet that's exactly what people mean when they say they're \"going to Disney Ward\".
The portion of tickets distributed online via Internet sites such as Craigslist or eBay can be used as multi-day universal tickets to visit the park.
Despite the expansion of such practice, it is banned by Disney: flowers are not subject to transfer.
If you want to break the camp below the edge of the Grand Canyon, you need to get permission to visit remote areas of the state.
To protect the canyon, a limited number of permits are issued. They can be obtained, starting 1 day of a certain month, four months before the first month of travel begins.
Accordingly, permission to visit remote areas of the state, which will start operating in May, can be obtained on January 1.
Basically, in areas with the largest number of visitors to which the Bright Angel Campground belongs, which is next to the Phantom ranch, the sites are filled through the performance of demands received on the first day that these sites become available for armour.
By personal returns are issued in order of turn a limited number of permits reserved for this purpose.
A wonderful way to see the beauty of the region and get to places that are seen from normal tourist routes is to travel South Africa on cars.
If carefully planned for this, you can use a conventional car, however the best option will be a full-size car. In many places, you can only fall on a full-size high-wheelbase car.
Mayte in mind, if you deliver a plan that although in South Africa the situation is stable, in neighbouring countries this is far from right.
Different countries present different requirements for issuing a visa and costing it. In addition, these requirements can be determined by which country you come from.
Besides, each country has its own, it only owns it, legislation in this field. mentioned laws spell out what kind of things designed to assist in emergencies, you need to have in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town in the western part of Zimbabwe that is nearby Botswana, on the border with Livingston, that of Zambia.
The city is in the immediate vicinity of the main attraction, the waterfalls.In addition, this popular tourist direction offers both sightseeings and adventure seekers many opportunities to stay here longer.
From November to March, the side, over the rainy season, water volume increases, and the waterfall itself looks where more effectually.
If you walk through a bridge or one of the trails that you're abducting a waterfall, you're definitely soaking.
At the same time, it is because of such an enormous amount of water that it will be difficult for you to consider the waterfall itself, for all this water will shut it down!
The tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62).It is possible that KV62 is the most famous burial site in the valley, where in 1922 Howard Carter found almost that the young king's grave was intact.
The tomb of Tutankhamun is hardly worth visiting, in contrast to most other royal tombs.It is much smaller and decorated quite modestly.
All occupants to see what damage the mummy attempted to get her out of the coffin would be disappointed because only the head and shoulders of the pharaoh could be seen.
There is no longer any fairy riches in the grave - they have been moved to the Cairo Museum of Egyptian Culture.
Visitors are better off spending time anywhere else if it is limited in them.
There is a temple named Phnom Krom 12 km southwest of the town of Seemreapu.This temple building on top of the hill came in the late 9th century when King Jashavarman ruled.
We should climb the mountain to enjoy the dismal atmosphere of the temple and Lake Tonle Sap.
Catering on a boat by lake and visiting this place can be questioned without problem.
Going to Tonla Sap, don't forget to take a passport because it is necessary to have a pass at Angkor in order to pass to the temple.
The capital and larger city of Israel is Jerusalem, with most countries along with the UN not recognizing the status of capital after it.
The ancient city located on the Judean Mountains has an interesting thousand years of history.
Followers of three monotheistic religions — Christianity, Islam, and Judaism — consider the saint to be this city, which functions as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.
Jerusalem is one of the main tourist directions in Israel thanks to its religious value, as well as to the many attractions that are located in the Old City.
Even so, the lively and multi-people shopping malls, cafes and restaurants in Jerusalem are many historical, archaeological and cultural attractions.
According to Ecuador's demand before entering Ecuador via international airports or crossing border points, Cuban citizens have to receive the appropriate invitational letter.
This letter, which must meet certain requirements, needs to be attested in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador.
The purpose of the requirements mentioned above is to ensure the orderly flow of migrants between the two countries.
Those Cuban citizens who have a species to reside in the United States should visit the Consulate of Ecuador to be exempted from having to comply with the mentioned requirement.
At least 6 months after the date of travel your passport must be valid. To confirm the stay period required a ticket there and back or a ticket to the third country.
For big groups, tours cost less, so when you travel on your own or along with just one friend, you will get to know other travelers and gather into a group of four to six people so that the costs of one will fall short.
Tourists often move to fill cars, so there's really no reason to worry about it.
It's, in its own way, more like trying to get people to believe they're going to have to pay more.
It is a cool mountain, in the background of which photographs of ruins are often taken, rising above the northern part of Machu Picchu.
In most of its physically trained people can handle this difficult and cool lift in approximately 45 minutes, although on the bottom it looks a little scary.
Along most of the way, stone steps are laid, and in steeper sections can be held for steel tross that function as banisters.
And yet, it is possible that you will not grasp the air. Be careful and careful at the steeper sections, especially when under your feet the wet soil, for it may bear in its own danger.
The path follows a small cave that is located near the summit.It is rather low and narrow.
It is better for all viewing places and being familiar with the wildlife of the Galapagos Islands from a boat, also as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
Over 60 cruise vessels make flights in Galapagos waters - their size varies from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people are in advance of defending themselves a place (because there are usually no free places on the ship in the midst of the season).
The agent through whom you will do the brone must necessarily be a specialist in the Galapagos Islands, which is well dealt with in a variety of ships.
Because of this, you will end up on a ship that best meets your personal interests and (or) limitations.
Northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas by the time the Spanish came in the 16th century.The then central and southern Chile was inhabited by indigenous Oricans (mapuche).
In addition, the Mapuche were one of the last independent groups of American indigenous peoples that were not completely swallowed during Spanish-speaking rule.This only happened after Chile gained independence.
The decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818, despite Chile declaring independence in 1810 (in the background of the Napoleonic Wars, when Spain remained without a valid central power for several years).
The Dominican Republic (which in Spanish is called República Dominicana) belongs to the Caribbean countries. together with Haiti it is on the island of Espanyolo, occupying the eastern part of the latter.
The country may not only boast of white sandy beaches and mountainous landscapes. in addition to this, there is still the oldest European city on the American continent, which is today part of Santo Domingo.
The island was originally inhabited by the people of Taíno and the Caribbean. The language used by the Caribbean, which was influenced by the island approximately 10,000 years before AD, was called the Aravacan.
The Spanish invaders greatly reduced the number of the Taíno people in those several years that passed after the arrival of European explorers.
According to the data that Frei Bartholome de las Casas brought in his book The Indian Home, Spanish invaders from 1492 to 1498 destroyed an estimated 100,000 secrecy.
The Jardin de la Union. was built as an atrium for a 17th-century female convent, where the Templa de San Diego is the only building that has been preserved until now.
It now plays the role of the central square, and there always — and day by day, and night by night — something happens.
The garden is surrounded by several restaurants, and the central pavilion in the afternoon and evening often becomes a venue for free concerts.
Calechon del Besa (albeit the kiss). Old legend of love still lives on two balconies, the distance between which is only 69 centimetres.
Children can tell you this story for just a few pence.
One-day trips or tours to Bowen Island are used popularly, during which one can skate on kayaks, walk on foot, visit shops, restaurants, and many more.
This self-sufficient place is in Hau Saund Bay near Vancouver. This is where you can get water taxis without problems.They are sent from Granville Island, which is downtown Vancouver, and walk on schedule.
The amateur of active rest should necessarily be played on \"The corridor from sea to sky\".
The town of Whistler (which is 1.5 hours old riding from Vancouver) is an expensive but well known resort because the Winter Olympics took place here in 2010.
In the winter you're happy to welcome the best ski resorts in North America, and in the summer you can enjoy skating on a real mountain bike.
Allowances need to be ordered in advance. An appropriate permit is required to spend the night in Siren.
\"Sirena\" is the only flattery where, in addition to the camp stand, you are offered accommodation in the internet and hot dishes.In La León, San Pedrillo and Los Patas, you are only offered a place for a camp stand without food.
Permission to visit the park can be obtained directly at a forestry facility in Puerto Jimenas, but credit cards there do not accept
The Park Service (at the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications) issues permits to visit the park no earlier than one month before the intended arrival date.
\"CaffeNet El Sol\" offers a armouring service, with the commission being US$30 (or US$10 when it comes to day-to-day defences). More information can be obtained on the Carcavad National Park page.
The Cook Islands are an island country in Polynesia.It is in the middle of the southern Pacific and has self-governing territory status in free association with New Zealand.
The area of this archipelago, comprising 15 islands, exceeds 2.2 million km2 of ocean.
These islands are often perceived as \"turned over Hawaii\" because they are in the same time zone as Hawaii.
Despite these islands being smaller in size, they resemble some elderly Hawaii tourist of the period when they were not yet part of the United States and there were no huge hotels or other enclosures on them.
There are no mountains in the Cook Islands.They include 15 different islands.Raratongo and Aitutaki are the largest of them.
Today, in developing countries, hotel services from the \"nightleg and breakfast\" category in the luxury segment have become really art.
It is apparent that in the elite segment of the hotel, \"nightleg and breakfast\" are competing across two main settings: bedrock and breakfast.
In the best objects of this type, therefore, one can find the most luxurious bedrock affiliations, either an antique bed or a lapel blanket of manual work.
For breakfast, you may offer firmen master dishes or seasonal lassures typical of this region.
All this can be obtained in an old historic building with antique furniture, next to which is a viewing site with a swimming pool.
To sit in your own car and go on a far journey is so simple and so attractive.
You apparently already know how to drive your car, and you're familiar with its limitations, that you can hardly say big-sized cars.
Unwanted attention is easy to draw the location of the tent on private property or any size in the city.
One word, your own car will go perfectly up for a journey, yet it is not very convenient to be used as a rest tent.
Kemping in the car will be more comfortable if you are a commuter owner, a large miniven, a sedan, or a unit with seats decomposing.
The legacy of some hotels was given to them from the golden age of ocean liners and steam railways, which began even before World War II, in the 19th or early 20th century.
In the mentioned hotels, it was painful to have time for rich and famous people, often here offering excellent food and nightly entertainment.
In addition, the creation of their image is influenced by both old-fashioned furniture and lack of newer benefits, and certain elaborate and elegant aging.
They are occasionally stopped by heads of state and other high-ranking individuals, despite the fact that generally such hotels are privately owned.
If there is a lot of money in the wanderer, it can choose a round-world flight with accommodation in many such hotels.
The organization, known as the Hospitality Sharing Network, links riders and local residents in cities who are planning to visit.
Usually, in order to join such a network, one must simply fill a registration questionnaire on the Internet. However, some networks require or suggest that additional verification should pass.
In that case, a list of available landlords is posted in print and/or online, sometimes with references and feedback from other travelers.
The international guest network Cowchsörfing founded programmer Casey Fenton in January 2004, after he found a cheap flight to Iceland, but he had no place where one could stop.
He sent e-mails to local university students and received very many answers with suggestions of residency without pay.
Hosting guests are primarily young people.The age of the typical guest is between twenty and thirty years old. Still, more adult customers here also occur.
Families with children rarely meet, but provided they reside in private rooms some hostels allow them to stop in themselves.

As a rule, the length of such activities is between three and six months.Places for them to be held must have an area of at least 50 hectares.
Many film formats have already been used for years.The most common is the standard 35 mm format film (for negatives, 36 by 24 mm).

The 6 by 6 cm format, and more accurately the 56 by 56 mm negates, is used by some film cameras.
The resulting separation exceeds the same in a 35 mm negate almost four times (3,136 mm2 compared to 864 mm2).
