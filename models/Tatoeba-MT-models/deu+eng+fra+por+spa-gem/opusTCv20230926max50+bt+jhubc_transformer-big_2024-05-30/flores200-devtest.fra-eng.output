This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say the plumage of this animal was brown brown on the top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also helps to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, called a spine, but nevertheless show other feather-specific characteristics – beards and beards – the researchers inferred that the spine was probably a subsequent evolutionary development to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display.The researchers suggested that, even if it is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows an adult plumage and not a chicken's down.
Scientists say it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.

The work was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts traction on earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a sort of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

“They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.”
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the planet's large caves that maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the earth," said Glen Cushing, a crew member of the USGS (American Center for Geological Studies) and staff at the University of North Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope is present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

Her other race, the giant slalom, allowed her to finish in tenth place in the group of women sitting with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes less than Austrian Claudia Loesch, finishing first, and 1:09.02 minutes less than Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, finishing ninth.
In the women’s skiing category, four skiers failed to complete their course; in the case of giant slalom, 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in this race failed to rank.
Police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we retrieved her phone and laptop.”
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had their faces concealed when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit it, none were injured.
However, the driver was severely injured in the head.
The track where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to remove the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff’s Court.
She is in custody awaiting her indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait was widely disseminated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor's office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told reporters that no further comments would be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will focus on the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents to a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Park Conservation and Heritage Officer at the NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly yesterday inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth JEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at engaging the country in new elections.
This commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called “non-serious.”
The ministry said it was "really unfortunate" that Apple's report was postponed.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage had been reported in that country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by diverting their buses to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been saved, and the deaths of at least six of them have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He was trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the baby’s lung maturation.
The Xinhua agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or “black boxes”) on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... or even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election found that the number of opponents of Australia’s transformation into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to reign over Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the medications needed to overcome his pain, as these were banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest number ever known.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors “political chatter and nonsense.”
He is expected to run for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly for shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technologies, not ground-based radar systems used before, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transportation is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and relay parks are not available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transport created the possibility that the game could be played behind closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process has been estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-beaked immigrant finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny coins
It can be drawn in thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in the pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in Roman civilization toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women were side-by-side.
When you call a person thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways, and the biggest advantage it has brought us is that it has made transportation much easier and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized felines that eat equally medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free pet cats) that eat the smaller prey, much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and lions.
Women are usually very close to each other, their families being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as the lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roaring of the tiger does not resemble the roaring of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be screams and rumblings.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots hunt and find the animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing their path on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealthily. The ocelots track their prey by merging into their environment before throwing themselves at them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they come (for example, if they move over a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily go back), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one in which they were before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, it always needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species.Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaurus was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing except the other mosasaurus.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharp razor-like teeth, as well as an additional series of teeth in the palate, so that anything crossing his path could not escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had a split tongue, including turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not sized against it.
Although the Romans ate food that we know, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails and loir, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on the side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not include these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary that only priests could access.
Some pyramid towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street; the houses were built of stone.
As there were no great forests in the land of Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland has been sparsely populated, and in Scandinavian sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and found Greenland — and named it so — traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Treasure of the Templars, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776" were read. The text is at the bottom of the document, on the reverse side.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three-quarters of 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
Within just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civilian", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means large city or city-state and also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—under the articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its acts.
It also did not have the power to derogate from tax laws or those on customs duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended, and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most titled team in the world and it won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The earliest information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing by mentioned it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous cereal production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which he ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the temple of the sun and the room of the three windows.
Most of the adjacent buildings of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better glimpse of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the era of analog films.
It is still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the photographic sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, and it is quite confusing, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest of integer ratios) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family formats) are equal to this aspect report or approach it closely.
The third-party rule, heavily abused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that sparks dynamism while offering image protection.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound the European states among themselves despite differences in language and customs.
His ubiquitous power touched everyone, from the king to the landlord.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder if this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic provoked only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its boundless submarine war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; every stage of China or every family that was in power was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period that took place for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the most bloodthirsty periods in the history of Chinese Antiquity, with thousands of people dying in battle to sit on the throne of the grand palace of XI'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Thus, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the ranking of the armies is no longer based on the class, but on the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes from other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond the scope of this worldly life. He used to attend a cave that became famous as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. When you go into the cave, you're completely isolated.
Above you can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, many temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Kheops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives as well as members of his family.
The “push” symbol resembles a V and the “pull” symbol resembles a staple or a square whose lower side is missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the upside (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward arch generally produces a softer sound, while a downward arch is louder and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to inscribe your own marks on the pencil, but remember that the printed arch marks are for a musical reason, and therefore in general they must be respected.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their chariots.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the terrorized queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking establishments.
Naturally, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe running from the eleventh to the thirteenth century (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological thrust or technological imperative to a strict sense that the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process that far exceeds cultural and political influences, and technology affects societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care techniques to treat bodily injury.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography would have emerged, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered that of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury epicenter began around the year 400, and lasted until around 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th–11th century and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, Western modes could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest progress of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothes.
Subsistence farming is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system, using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers had subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share ideas that allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often report their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "fierce" or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When raised entirely by non-human species, wild children exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but rather a way to help learners discover new teaching such as using a new curriculum or starting a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little Microsoft Office trombone man is one too.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to query, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult for the student to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We see the family placement system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Host family placement is supposed to provide all the necessities that were missing in the home from which they were previously withdrawn.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors in favour of the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person lies by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President’s Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech because of brain injury are nonetheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reserve of the expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two basins for each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
By contrast, animal food (anims, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the vital amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” a bit in the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent wake-up call, in order to bring you back to consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known to be a diuretic), forcing you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force is. Every person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real clashes, through substitute armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties.
The use of ships for carriage of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and property, while interfering with your enemy’s ability to move its people and property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures, often cared for by shepherds who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term shepherds.
The wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks for wagons were simply made of parallel wooden boards, they enabled the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and to pull higher loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The crossings were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with an iron strip on top.
This has become common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (“right man”).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even fight to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, this is symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that problems have become more important because of the overcrowding and extravagant way of life of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few streets away to John Dunlap's print shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the court of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many palaeontologists nowadays believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them as dinosaurs being given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on both their back legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic drugs or household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects very suitable for parasitizing humans.
Reduves, like bed bugs, are nest-like, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in that of the child, to take care of the upbringing of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only experiment, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West has been cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue an operating cycle for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can go to see, photograph and discover the Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by car to get to their workplace and meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on passenger cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from its state of stability that has sustained human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of the company and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in a rough way.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape their enemies and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragon flies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because the Earth doesn’t feel like it’s moving, doesn’t it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of water from the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the world’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, collecting water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed by their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants, the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they are found in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, they were the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that the latter are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing modes has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and rarer uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like climbing a hill to a heavy cart, dividing the core again, then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding out what makes people feel good or attracted to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. One of the ends of the spectrum is trying to remain "the right buddy" (or the right girlfriend).
This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting assessments, entrusting responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she has to change everything the group has created so far and do things his/her own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports and sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to impose on itself the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer’s need.
Before an organization is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumors, and brain trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often heavily known as science fiction, it represents a very important part of the computer sciences that study the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research is aimed at automating tasks using task machines that require an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to clients’ diagnostics and questions, and the recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been laid down in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not feasible.
The solution is brought by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at antique objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while sitting with their classroom.
Participating practically on an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website dedicated to their visit to the state capital each year. Each year, the site is updated, but older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try the blog experience with overlooked grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts striving to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging “requires students to learn more about the world around them” and the need to attract public interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used properly, blogs ""can enable students to strengthen their analytical abilities and critical mindset: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with that of others and express their own views on very specific topics"" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings that have a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners consider the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the East African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent on its own, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands and this religion spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Road that connects Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a ring (which should not seem too valuable.
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they consider to be harassment, as it is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men’s advances, and don’t be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, eventually abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and all kinds of trinkets, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city’s streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to understand the state of fighting that persists in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal price (local) is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, from Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, which is divided into 14 ecozones, each home to a specific fauna.
It is one of the most well-known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees for the park.
It can be beneficial to get a Wild Card that gives access to some of South Africa’s parks, as well as all of South Africa’s national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main center of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings drawing the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the highlands of the north shore.
This is the place that the British settlers invested, so it seems to me to be a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only made up of mangrove swamps; they also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water/sump areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese cabotages, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a bridge overlooking the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and St. George's-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two tracks 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or harvesting.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly nicknamed "the giant province of India", was born from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous populations.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
In addition, tournaments and smaller matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out Polo's Asociacion Argentina.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to a Pound Sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted.
On nearby islands, credit cards are not likely to be accepted, even if British and U.S. currencies may be. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands money outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical zone and summer temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There aren't really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall is pretty much constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are nonetheless wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you have to stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, the bison, the moose, the moose, the bear and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa and is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally in the city, during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular ones can be found in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour District) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coastline. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is “Number One”, a fairly ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, the “Manta”.
There are plenty of French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any fears about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips on the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all the signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, jellyfish boxes arrive near beaches and river estuaries, and can sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would depart from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies typically offer packages including breakfast, airport shuttle service or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They may also retain the reservation for you if you need time to reflect on the offer or obtain other documents necessary for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests must be made to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will need to arrive early to find a well-placed campsite.
Remember that even if the music shows are finished on the main stages, other music shows may continue until late at night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed huts.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. They rarely find windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the good mood of the guests and keep them on site.
At some sites, it is the locals who offer alcoholic beverages for free. Nevertheless, drunkenness alters judgment, and all the good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone who drives to high latitudes or crosses mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, it can fall in a very short time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or powder or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most striking moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion to African land, and in particular to the savannah, with the aim of witnessing the striking spectacle of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars and standard equipment allows for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called “bush walking”, “walking safari” or “jogging”) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but starting at the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be borrowed, even if there are none in the rooms.
If you don’t have an iron or don’t want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid letting the fabric not overheat (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others, it must be done for several minutes.
The efficiency of the filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they do not know in their region of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some locations, duty-free shops provide an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated inland terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, keep your mind open: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are rather good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are baked and baked all year round, while cherries and plums point the tip of their nose in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a tight cup of coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be “solid” or “liquid,” depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other term, it tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javan cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors that Javans prefer being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javan coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The calipers are supports for the foot of the rider, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety issue: in fact, the user's feet can get stuck there.
If a rider is projected from a horse but has a foot caught in the caliper, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large walls and different granite cliffs.
From the top of the mountains, the views of the mountains are breathtaking. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new walkable paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless.
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums", who organize their entire holiday according to the skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings showing skiers date to some 5,000 BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first leisure ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to alpine hiking skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel a little longer distances than on foot – but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on damaging slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under conventional circumstances, travelling through several countries involves having to carry out several visa applications and undergoing several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a bit like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the space, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of whether a manufactured object is an antiquity. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiquities.
The criteria vary depending on where you are located; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than that in force in Europe.
Artisanal products can be considered antiques, even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer breeding is an important means of subsistence among the Samis and the culture that surrounds this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Samis were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, they lived on fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as trait animals.
Today, many Sams practice modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.

Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An internet search for "Course in a Hostile Environment" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues addressed here in a much more detailed way, usually with hands-on experience.
Training normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning a gender change operation abroad must ensure that they have valid documents in their possession for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports whose sex is not indicated (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and sex varies.

Transgender people in the preoperative phase should not expect to pass the scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Ripping currents are the currents that return from waves that break on the beach, often on a pitfall or equivalent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid current towards deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to target a place where you will not be caught again. It is also possible that depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for relief.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have struggled to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When you go home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your original culture.
At first, when you were traveling abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.

The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and 16 of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula and King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples include Livingston Island and Deception, where the caldera flooded with a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountain Range, 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel chain, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a cellular network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by shipments that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them choose this opportunity.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, because it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken sabbatical year courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of doing higher education in your country.
As a general rule, a registration fee is required to attend these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don’t necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, with a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only land with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located at all near the seaside and no tour of this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
Do not be ashamed of it: it is no different from the personal fears and fears that many people feel about other things.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Freight forwarders are well-paid to make fast deliveries, and often, as part of an urgent repair, the issue of timeliness is crucial for documents, goods or related spare parts.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to unload and pass customs.
The only way to send it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that is where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a large amount of money for that privilege (or, better still, to ask your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
In general, there is no need to seek discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of passengers who are willing to pay very much for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares informedly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.

There are still many living women and men who have survived their stay here, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or non-Jews indifferently.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scraping graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and virtually everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that it is the first official language.

Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.

Premodern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their time was not as worrying as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures placed in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

All the animals that have arrived on these islands have originally done so by water, by swimming or aboard floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance between them and the mainland, the mammals were unable to reach the end of the voyage, making the giant turtle the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to admire the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day long.
