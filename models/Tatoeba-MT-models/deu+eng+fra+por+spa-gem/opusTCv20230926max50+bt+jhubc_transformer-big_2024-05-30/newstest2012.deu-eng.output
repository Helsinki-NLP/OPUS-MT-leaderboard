No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused the request to abolish the paragraphs on which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted, as part of an amendment to the Criminal Code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned Prime Minister, rejected MEPs at the second reading of the request for mitigation of penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly detrimental contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The ruling has not yet come to an end, and the appeal of the convicted will be brought to court in December.
Timoshenko himself describes the verdict as political revenge of the regime and also in the West, the trial raised the suspicion of the bias of the court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to be removed from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Only the winners have to be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which ones - the moderate ones or the radical ones.
The National Transitional Council confessed to the customary right of the Sharia, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft you cut off your hand shortly.
Women should forget about emancipation as quickly as possible, any apostates are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Qur’an from each other’s opposing tribes.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would be hardly imaginable in this country and especially hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively probably not the best and would hardly fit the aforementioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even helped by the unbelieving dogs.
Their excuse may be the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not led by any general from America, but by Allah Himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We took part in only one gunfire, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians freed themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to abstain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals get rid of a concern - namely the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But do the oil companies get the black gold at a mocking price even without occupation?
Perhaps hardly, and so the West can finally boast of its selflessness in terms of the protection of human rights.
If it is not for them, the Shar<0xC4><0xAB><0xCA><0xBF>a representatives will perish.
Beginning of a new era of crisis
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke through Europe.
Each country published its GDP figures for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, with Germany and France increasing.
But today the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but now also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany posted higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated, and according to the Statistical Office, the trend of slowing growth in economic performance was confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Between July and September, the economy grew 0.2 percent across the eurozone and the EU compared to the previous quarter, consistent with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year government bonds rose to 28.45%.
The returns on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to experience problems...
Returns on Czech government bonds remain below 4%, even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, voices are loud that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualify for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualifying for 200 million
The soccer selection has mastered the toughest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper <0xC4><0x8C>ech and a superb goal by Petr Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football could thus defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed reportage.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech national team also won very happy 1:0 thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant <0xC4><0x8C>ech's and the hero of the day Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro, thus redeemed their ticket to the football EM.
Also due to the precise defensive game of the Czech team, they were able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half.
The bad birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech selection will be involved in the European Championships next year, it is also delightful that a premium of about 200 million will be awarded to domestic football.
From the first few minutes onwards, there was a lot of fighting football.
Both teams combined lengthy and so was played mainly around the middle line.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team remained and the wide knockouts in front of the penalty area were successfully averted by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s core program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday noon and then proclaimed the death of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan in Iran formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed, on Tuesday.
They wanted to make it known that they were willing to protect their country’s core program, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran apparently has long not given up on its efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and then proclaimed the death of the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at making Iran’s nuclear program as largely lame as possible, according to the Israeli press, from the center in Isfahan would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan’s attack target.
The menu of a fat-addicted child: he does not have breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have proven - obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important for a person’s healthy development is the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him are.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner on the day before the reconnaissance campaign under the motto "Obesity is no coincidence".
In families with thickets, sports is not exactly a favorite activity, but the majority of today's students are also concerned - only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of the school year last year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools surveyed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the "Obesity is not a coincidence" campaign, which is supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12,000 students from 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the frighteningly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
“Only half of the children surveyed reported eating breakfast-breakfast-lunch-second evening-breakfast five times a day – one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet,” says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative little things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the families of the students have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
The worst was the finding that in every tenth family there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey test showed that in the families of overweight children, unhealthy fries are consumed much more often.
And almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent)
While more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do — only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own meal plans based on the possibilities offered by appetite and opinion.
“What Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many meals, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming above all is the great popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. the main dish, pasta beat just in front of poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunches was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get correct information.
"In many cases, the control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire after the conclusion of the informative lecture "Obesity is not accidental", there was a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating," the results of the project are cited.
This was noticeable, for example, with the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed in the questionnaire much more often poultry or fish as the main course of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had a bit of a fuss that that was a little too much stuff for the start.
I didn’t know at all what was to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the pitch" runs.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the exam comes, the more information and practical tasks we have before us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still full.
This time, we discussed with Director Alena (no one man takes part in the course) how to dress a woman who has no ideally proportioned figure.
And that is, after all, most of us.
Some have a neck too short, others a figure too young without decent curves and again others are molly.
It is up to the stylist to visually hide wide shoulders, to lengthen the neck or to highlight the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a woman like Jennifer Lopez -- that is, with a big bust, a wide hip and a narrow waist -- pretty and figurative without her looking too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so great that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least have a piece tailored.
You will certainly not regret this, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a bespoke skirt you feel much better than in one of the rod that always slips up and down, protrudes in the waist, etc.
Young figures can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, studs, applications, embroidery or raffing.
With this amount of information and types of figures, I am glad that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my mind thoroughly.
And yet I’m afraid that it’s almost impossible in the face of homework assignments.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity, for which she should design suitable outfits - daywear and evening dress.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and his type of figure.
I'm supposed to "dress up" Miranda Kerr, which you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably gained a hundred pounds lately (well, that's a little exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the garments from magazines or search, print and then graphically edit them on the Internet.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about types of figures, was seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a smart stylist is able to work with a single garment in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to pull up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks very different.
“Play with it,” he stressed.
But most of all, the following advice came to me: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
“Then you can hurt her,” Jakub said.
I finally realize why we need to punch all these teachings, what to combine with what and why, even if you often get to see quite different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variations than he ultimately photographs.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to count on all of this when designing the outfit.
The fact that image and style sometimes make up half of the success was also confirmed by Jan Pokorný.
You just have to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer who made image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, one is more reserved to the services of a stylist.
Also well-known personalities often consider this to be thrown away money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look is secondary).
And if someone of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she is very likely to impose on us a completely different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to google to determine with certainty that the tabloid is writing, the corresponding celebrity has increased or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist just needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he must communicate above all with the people he styles and he must be a wise psychologist.
Appreciate people without being obsessed and standing by their opinion.
“If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and add up to pretty pieces, then we can’t clean out the entire wardrobe and say, ‘Oh my God, that’s terrible.’”
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can wear," Mario says.
He also showed us quite concretely what a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So this is a bag that you button at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary properties.
Apart from clear things such as scissors, hair removal scrubbers or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips, with which the clothes are sewn back, if it is not too large (plugging needles or other clamps).
But so that we can not only listen, but also try something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We glued and glued...
With the scissors you must not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to go cleverly.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The aforementioned skill is not exactly my strength.
All of this was only a fraction of what we heard on the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has now become clear to me - devoting myself to styling at a professional level is not a breeze.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Rezension
The original carefree journey is made possible by a series of completely avoidable dilettant errors for the routine journey to the early shift.
Although it managed to fulfill the ambitions for a large part, what good is it if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before it came to the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the already aged game series "Need for Speed" once again to a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples it did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the adapted passages fall out, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you’re used to with NFS, in the end, a lot is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially it is quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is diminished by some superfluous mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of an in principle incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
The first time you are introduced to history, whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit at the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole host of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is run on a different track and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
It doesn’t feel like the game will always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very pretty to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the ride through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape looks visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, atypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that greatly restricts the view.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be hellishly careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are built quite well in succession.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect a further personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are also involved, who want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations, in which Jack runs away from anyone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, however, there are far fewer such passages in the game than you would expect (in particular, probably only three).
Ultimately, this is more to the advantage of the thing, because this element at least has no chance of getting bored - it belongs in the context of the above mentioned one of the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, although it does not tear up trees, on the other hand you could not claim it to be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But an action-packed race will continue to do quite well with the local driving model, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems only appear after a certain period of time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
A game of this type is hardly expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how the car is behaving before any impact on any object, obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: When you narrowly overtake or pass by oncoming cars, you "scramble" the other car in some places only easily, but in other, almost identical situations, you get into the loop and turn wild pirouettes.
Or drive the cart to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this does not matter any more, it is always annoying.
The restarts are solved like this: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then you throw the game back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
When you've exhausted them, everything starts from the beginning.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something does not succeed, but you should not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even the restart does not help, it does not help anything but to learn the critical section from the head.
It is very unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, you have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't pass through.
Elsewhere you will always meet "civil" cars in the same configuration at the appropriate location, whether you are the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent passes two coming cars in front of a game, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass them or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, because everything is designed in such a way that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The counterparts have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken in the same place by the same opponent and again here regardless of the timing.
The most insane is this at the end of the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously overtake one here on hell get out.
And if he’s in front of you, of course, he’s taking the view away, so you’ll start driving your own car a few times in Klump.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly misses you the pleasure of the game.
And that’s a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is overall quite entertaining and sometimes so action-packed that you almost don’t know where your head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what's "to blame" for it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car during the races.
You should not overlook the gas stations on the route, because here you can change the car, although in most cases the car that you currently have is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game’s story mode also goes the task mode (challenges) – that is, the races in the individual locations that you know from history.
There are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the story.
In order to get to the higher driver level, different items need to be opened up: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected to the online Autolog function, which compares your own results with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race in history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (my way), where you race long on the rails (my way) in the dark.
On the tacho, numbers look between 150 and 200 km/h (my way), but there suddenly comes a subway from behind and drives an uncompromising one to scrap.
In our editorial we will probably argue for a long time whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit you anyway.
The sound reproduction is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to as broad a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "from everyone something" was created - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game weren’t curtailed by the aforementioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have been able to contend with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game looks somehow unfinished.
In itself a classy pleasure, but you should be prepared to get these mistakes in your eyes with the power of airport headlights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the individual institutions palpable."
I wouldn’t have expected such a hard war to unleash.”
"It will take five, six years for the waves to smooth out and everyone will get used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, her speech at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her lecture, she demonstrated how seriously she took the motto "Intelligible and open about Europe", in which she was able to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied so many lecturers of the Law Faculty of the Karlsuniversität.
Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
“In the beginning, criticism was loud that he was too unobtrusive – a grey official who wasn’t fit for such a role, but I have to say, it’s blown everyone’s breath away by how well he took care of the matter.
“He is a person who is able to patiently listen to and communicate with twenty-seven member states and who has a clear idea of how to move forward with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in response to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our oil cap quartz
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda on which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was described as a success.
The Czechs would have managed the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the government's case during the presidency as a major negative, which has greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, not only the presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, was quite hectic.
And there is still the need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes it much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which economic sectors are given priority, which countries are more and which are less funded - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Intelligible about Europe".
“If I don’t like something, it’s grey abbreviations, foreign words, and technical jargon that no one understands.
How can I, as a citizen, really know if you really think of curly or round cucumbers and differently large bananas in Brussels or if someone really wants to ban us from quarrels.
She would also have liked to use the ground of the EU to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
Many factors are to blame for this, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?'
According to Vicenové, the EU expects in the future, above all, tough rules on the budget policies of the Member States.
As much more real than a "European federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries of the Eurozone and the countries outside the Eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of strengthened cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that only those countries that want to work together and those that don’t should stand quietly apart.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, ultimately resulting in a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," said Vicenová.
In this regard, it also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues with an impact on the whole EU must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the Eurozone countries.
Brand Story.
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM’s strategy, then that would probably be the word “longevity”.
To the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its founding.
The foundation for this longevity was already laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he used the slogan, countless global problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became the hallmark of the future giant's life (and at the same time the title of the company's in-house magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
“For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived, and was successful for a century, because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope we can do even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Well-thought-out system
Already in the 1930s Watson operated social care for his employees - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid vacation as one of the first American employees, insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thoughtful compensation system for the best newcomers and traders.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the beginning – as one of the first companies in the world, IBM lifted all discrimination – and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan, which will replace Palmisan at IBM’s top next year, is also replaced by a woman – Virginia Rometty.
She has been at IBM for thirty years and has so far taken on the position of sales, marketing and strategy chief.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called online brainstorming, which has resulted in many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, because almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Its unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both inside and out.
“From the very beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems through technology," added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to only be present in the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo family-named "Big Blue" - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most well-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or even the floppy disk.
With approximately $220 billion in stock market value (market capitalization), IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (compared to Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or even the computers IBM PC jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so you should not be emotionally bound to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms — and if they don’t work, leaving them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising Technologies
The largest share of IBM’s earnings are services, software and hardware, each accounting for one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware was the most represented with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion of low-profit offshoot assets, but at the same time it has invested $58 billion in purchasing future-oriented technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern-day financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment scope in the midst of the great global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives today’s crisis undamaged.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008, and the company’s net profit is growing continuously.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: everything can be changed – just values don’t.
This is also why it is expected that this flexible giant will also cope with the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Spaceflight
Founded a hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It wasn’t until 1924 that it took over the name IBM – originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM company was the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s and 19th century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous card clocks for registering the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also held the chairmanship of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the boss of Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader then even overshadowed IBM’s founders – based on Watson’s ideas to this day, the company’s invincible culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name implies, began manufacturing and distributing all kinds of machines for the trade – from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades that Watson led the company, he doubled its revenues to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chief chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's technicians and computers helped guide NASA's flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous human flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that defined the computer standard of that time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, it purchased the consulting part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the concept of “Smarter Planet”.
It embodies the intention to use technologies in a wise way in areas not even planned so far, for example to improve the situation in transport and city administration.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smarter Commerce” platform, which is designed to help traders guide the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932, IBM founded a branch in then Czechoslovakia – the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno, among other things.
The Central and Eastern Europe Headquarters is based in Prague and there is also a top team of world-class researchers working on voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) from the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45) became their lover, Darina still remained hopeful that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the future she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová, the singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová, had taken refuge in her own house, she would not even have dreamed of how it was with her husband.
When Iveta moved out after 30 days and back to <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>any on her urges, Joseph immediately went with her.
He even confessed publicly that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová leaves in the future, he will surely not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to finish his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man with whom I still have certain ties," Ms. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová said; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated from him and insisted only on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door for him, Joseph bears with dignity so far.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I do the purchases."
"I'm talking to Darina quite normally, we just don't share the bed," said J. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn’t want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep with each other, so I don’t care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take all responsibility.
The worst female misfortunes: How about you?
When men are asked to call some typical female misfortunes, they shake some out of their sleeves without exception.
Dear women, are you recognizing yourself in the following lines, in which we re-evaluate a few unseennesses that allow men to flow the blood into the veins?
Purchasing addiction
Does her husband accuse them of being shopping addicted?
Do you need to buy at least one quarrel a week?
Do you like shopping and can it be a bit more in promotions?
Then, in your case, it’s probably really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping pleasure halfway under control.
But hand on heart, which woman already can’t stand it, in search of a well-fitting outerwear just to stroll through a clothing store and not try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times you've told your husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I would have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
“Do I like you at all?”
Does it seem familiar to you?
Oh, yeah?
Then you may also be one of the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let go, but many men are allergic to it if their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly incompatible.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - at least twice a week.
Shame with your partner because he again tramples on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, you scold the children because the washbasin just scrubbed is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, where polishing does so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you should not overdo anything and that order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
This excessive purity can ultimately also harm mutual relationships and, above all, the tranquility in the family.
Stichling
"Dirty gym pants come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
It’s not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not have to complain as much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clatter and cheat, because behind their backs they are cuddled or even slandered or they forge alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to peer through such topics as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably each of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip in store.
Hands on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with gossip of crude caliber, to which nothing and no one is sacred, which probably despise everyone in their environment and which pose a considerable danger, especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
Ice hockey player Jaromír Jágr had a big stake in the Monday NHL match with two assists in the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux was the beneficiary of the thirty-nine-year-old hockey star's overview, adding an assistant and being proclaimed the best player of the match.
Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek also scored two assists in the same match.
Jágr told reporters after the game that he had prophesied a great evening for Giroux.
“I’m telling him before the game that he’s doing a hat trick today.”
I kind of felt that.”
"In time and again such a feeling comes," explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal already in the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek fought the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the whistle of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second third then belonged to the Flyers again.
Concretely Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr said.
"I wouldn't have thought in my life that I would play together with such an ice hockey player at the end of my career as I did with him."
"I'm so happy."
"I'm cutting my game to me."
“All the years in the NHL, my teammates put their game on me and now the pitch is turning around,” Jágr smiled.
Carolina still made the game a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he succeeded in a surplus of two against one.
"Excellent Pronger still acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
By this victory, Philadelphia sat at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and left in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens missed an undiscovered 2:3 penalty shootout in addition to their experienced Beck as well as their lead.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec was unable to change one of the penalties.
More than the points lost, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high sickness-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defenders to finish.
"That's bad."
"We ended the encounter with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
“But there’s nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"With every change, one wave of attack after another, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and had to get the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here,” said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
The Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec withheld thirty shots from Tampa Bay, thus contributing significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the goal of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters took part.
Travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five state-approved travel agencies in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at the time mainly sold only trips to the socialist countries of the Eastern bloc, in the West at the time only chosen ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (German Democratic Republic - GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula by the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovakia) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter to do so, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Already then the travel agencies also offered trips to the west, but then you had to take huge queues or even sleep in your sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even that was not the case.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge - the condition for an exit to the West - was only granted to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange pledge.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dads - a habit that continues to this day.
The velvet revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox that we are not aware of today is the fact that we could not travel to the most popular holiday country in the Czech Republic until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation in the neighbouring Western European countries was lifted, which prompted a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovakia simply could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
The Czech holidaymakers slept in the park while traveling to Paris, because who would have had the money to stay in a hotel or in a guesthouse at the time.
A typical feature of traveling abroad from the Czech Republic was a luggage compartment packed with canned food, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thus also the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to regularly prepare for charter flights after 1997, making air travel incredibly cheaper compared to the past thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the US, already had currencyless payment transactions with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-complete" travel was in 2000 when, thanks to high demand, the first direct charter flight was made to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter planes with Czech passengers fly to distant sunny countries every year; this year they fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another important moment in the era that marked our “post-revolutionary” development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than CZK 15 thousand per capita on a single holiday including the cost of the resort.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has not had a chairman, threatening that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there has been no agreement on the electoral order to be elected.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his post, urging his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the old quarrels between the two chambers of association broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This became clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People’s House in Prague’s Smíchov district in vain, because the trial resulted in no outcome and it was not just about the election itself.
In fact, it was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote in the General Assembly - only the statutory representatives or even the officials equipped with a power of attorney.
At least part of the agreement was reached on this one point, to which also the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law contributed, whose opinion was that representation on a basis of power of attorney was not appropriate.
However, disputes over the electoral order continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee clarify the matter any more, and at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Even though the views on the election changed a few times, the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The issue is whether to act in accordance with the statutes or whether a completely different model needs to be found," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three FA<0xC4><0x8C>R deputy chairmen representing professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the largest percentage support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is allegedly willing to enter into the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make sense at all, this mode would call into question the whole two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, who would best not bend the electoral order, but choose according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík agrees with this, even though the statutory electoral order is most likely to meet Pelta by all candidates.
"My wish is that it be elected as much as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense replacement variants are devised, as at the last Annual General Meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who ran for the first time and distinguished himself in his statements especially against Pelta.
Pelta is optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the soccer EM today would certainly contribute to calming the moods."
"If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at the professional level and at the regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
“I’m hoping for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is unclear.”
“This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to ‘correct’ the regulations for their own purposes.”
"Therefore, a re-blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not ruled out."
“I hope, however, that common sense will ultimately win,” Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game at all.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not even start in the morning in Prague due to a technical disturbance and so they were feverishly looking for a substitute variant, as to bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage in game.
In the end, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is supposed to come on Wednesday, is likely to be decisive.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister of Education, Youth and Personal Education, would have liked to push the divided parties within the country’s largest sports association to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming <0xC4><0x8C>STV Annual General Meeting, which is to take the Czech sport in a new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the Extraordinary General Meeting, could have identified a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have engaged in the fight for this top position at all.
“If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election.”
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," Paclík <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
So the main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from getting to the top of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the function of Chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
“I have spoken to a few people in person.”
“I can’t believe that some of them told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football right now.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disrupts Pelta’s connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates’ votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta holds the position of chairman.
"In his victory, today's condition would be preserved and there would be no progress in Czech football at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice as bad for football," Paclík said.
He also refers to the fact that Pelta’s name some time ago fell in connection with telephone wiretaps for investigation in a corruption affair, however, from which Pelta emerged without a penalty.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said <0xC5><0x99>ekl Paclík, who saw his earlier statement that "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but already somewhat calmer.
However, if Paclík wins in the Thursday election, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
The same is thought by another candidate - Rajchl, who Paclík supported before the October Annual General Meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to go to."
“He has great abilities.”
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's able to run the association as a manager."
“I’m not putting my nose in matters that I don’t understand,” said Paclík, who had caused a stir in September that he was behind the dismissal of the referee committee with Lu<0xC4><0x8F><0xC4><0x9B>k Macela at the head, replacing Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims he feels grown up to the role of association chairman.
He has also been the head of Pilsen since last summer, which celebrated the first league triumph with his support in May.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it.”
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committees, which is degenerating even in awkward situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy to Sparta chief Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>etínský, for example.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby among the top politicians for more money from the lottery tax to go into sport.
“That’s one of the crucial things that the new president should devote himself to.”
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their reasoning, but then they also have to say clearly where the money goes," he said.
Paclík also does not see his connection to the Pilsner club as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "supra-partisan".
Pelta in turn is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
“It’s not exactly ideal.”
"But it doesn't make much sense in my opinion to hypocritically transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party and return after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R statutes that would exclude a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would strengthen himself for the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R to get new statutes that will preclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The official from Jablonec is confident ahead of Thursday's hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly dissipate if the Czech elections succeed.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that, in the event of his election, he would focus on the national team and obtaining funding.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last Annual General Meeting and so the two-month break could help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
“He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone,” says the man, who is mainly affiliated with the Jablonecer Club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
He says he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is responsible for today’s problems with elections.
"Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June, bylaws were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had accepted.
If they hadn’t allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman by September,” Pelta said.
He used the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Association as an attraction for the delegates.
“If I’m to become president, I’m going to take it personally and I’m willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn’t work.”
“This is a fundamental thing without which he cannot be,” Pelta says.
In addition, he does not try to separate himself from his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education and he knows well that his counter-candidate would be his first deputy.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík also did not attack for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"However, his attacks were degrading and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"For this reason, too, many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his counterpart, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the bottom classes to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
“I would also endeavour to end all cases – from the Cause of Bohemians to the aftermath of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Even after that, I would jump into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football," the forty-six-year-old candidate <0xC4><0x8C>TK said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personnel cleansing.
"I would have to get acquainted with the work contents of all employees first," he said towards Strahov, where there is understandably nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the timely catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
“If it’s really the only controversial point, how to vote in the third round, then we’ll get over it.”
“Football needs credibility and it only wins back if it finally has a new leader,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will begin to work hard under him
If the current deputy chairman Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association at the general meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly discourage many people in the association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and hold the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve Bohemian’s case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, put more money into football, and otherwise continue the work that previous chairman Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has begun.
“As president, I want to devote myself to football as a whole.”
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to youth performance football."
"I don't mean to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and therefore would like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will be distributing tough tasks to keep football moving forward with milestones in every segment.”
Many wouldn’t be particularly delighted about it because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves,” he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he has considered not running at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don’t constantly throw sticks between my legs and question every step I take,” he said as an explanation for why he hesitated.
“A lot of people told me I shouldn’t give up because others would.”
“That’s trust that you can’t lose,” he said.
He is also supposed to be motivated to continue the work he began under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“In two years, we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t want to just throw that away.”
"Proceedings have been initiated that will probably only come into effect in a few years and I would not like to see someone stop them," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation could return to the times before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“I believe in systematic action and that’s something that Mirek Pelta doesn’t bring.”
“Behind him are above all people who would make football so that he would only be there for the chosen ones.”
I may be blamed for some things, but I am not biased.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want football for everyone because then everyone is doing well and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also opposes the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even though some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then rose to the first league each time."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Now that the head of the Pilsner club Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík has joined the fight for the role of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl said, adding that he saw the savings of tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not draw on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta, "he is disqualified from the outset to help regain confidence in Czech football," he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
“No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year.”
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek initiated and also the staffing in the commissions would obviously not fundamentally change."
He certainly wouldn’t want to turn things around in his favor,” Rajchl said.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
by Julia Stanek
Ufo-optic paddling pools, splendid pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, rest your tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past one and a half years, one thing was not to be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Leaning back on the water, she looked up in artfully designed domes, she swam against marble puddles waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
She liked a bath, she took it in her notebook on the fly - with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored by architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents them in her newly published book "Badenfreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn’t have much to do with sports, Meder says – only in the water is it different.
Annoyingly, only that swimming fans have to settle down with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can inhale the tantalizing scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird whistle in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says the Vienna-based Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Platchers in the jumping pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And when the builders have made an effort, swimming pools can be a real eye treat: "Instead of a floor you have a water surface in baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is doubled visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumpboards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreude" conveys on 190 pages valuable knowledge about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a quaint karst cave (cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürd).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam room there is a window from which you can observe the bustle on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open up it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder got the smell of chlorine into his nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strongly of heating oil that you hardly believe landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks to your skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech bath Luhatchowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902 has now been closed.
As Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds grow between the tiles.
On the other hand, the decay has been countered in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already been completed; you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the meticulous modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite swimming pool of the pool-kienner Iris Meder - and not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It's already an achievement to merge such different building styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, the diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor thing.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank to shed light on commodity business
by Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank abandoning its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the CEO wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on the global commodity exchanges drives prices up - and banks are therefore a part of the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, commodity betting was intended to hedge merchants against price fluctuations.
But by now, most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann reacted to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said no business is “worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake.”
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is due to be completed by the end of the year and the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board of Management – including a recommendation on how to handle them.
At the end of January, the bank’s top officials will announce the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even a complete reversal.
Ackermann crafts on his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthless banks are harming the general good today."
Ackermann is now particularly obliged as the top banking lobbyist.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments in its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter whether it’s about people suffering hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not change to the Supervisory Board, contrary to what was planned.
By turning away from controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses he hardly needs to shave himself - that would eventually have to do with his successor.
Every second would cancel commodity plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Just eleven percent consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments betting on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would, according to the survey, terminate any investments in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43% would advise acquaintances of such a bank, 49% said they were thinking about terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and a happy end: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion in Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disappeared.
It is now being reopened as an exhibition hall.
If modern post-war architecture is warmed up by clear shapes, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer is a fitting and famous example for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian Pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like side building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been set up after the world exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof, rebuilt and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20s House" was called it.
The building was not suitable, however, either spatially or technically as a museum - no walls to hang over art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has come down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21st House" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a chance in every way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has been enforced.
Husslein-Arco, a doctorate art historian with a considerable career, among other things, in youth as an ice skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, emphatically carried out the conversion with politicians and monument protectors, she secured the public funds and private sponsorship funds and
Apart from present-day art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookshop, and an office house had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was then the ideal cast for the execution.
Not only because he sensitively converted and expanded Joseph Olbrich’s Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but also because he studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pavilion was an “extremely important place” for him, where he had viewed the exhibitions “almost every weekend”.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and ease upon its transfer to Vienna and its conversion.
There were far greater problems with the current renovation: the building was "an energy shooter," Krischanitz says.
The window profiles of the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel supports have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements made room for the new use, a lowered light ditch between the house and the road ensures exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the lightweight Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house has been painted in the old red-brown anti-rust shade.
The cinema is exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often, a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the Office for the Conservation of Monuments," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rubble floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and lightweight.
It was difficult with the pavilion "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "raise a proper awareness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban success story: Around the Swiss garden is the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings.
And another lucky case may occur: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and you hear it is already negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the Swiss Garden.
Train plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of a total of around 300 million euros are planned.
This is intended to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees for snow removal on railway systems and platforms to 16,000 people.
The goal is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours by the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary routes.
Two months ago, Railroad CEO Rüdiger Grube warned of train failures and delays this winter after a top meeting with the government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacked reserves in difficult weather conditions, among other things.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Authority for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been creating for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains checked significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axle fracture in Cologne’s main railway station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in the United States
After the uproar about boss Josef Ackermann, new harm comes from the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems at home weren’t enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now also catching up with its past in the US: the Frankfurt Institute is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
Financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost strongly in value during the financial crisis and plunged the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said.
The bank did not admit guilt with the comparison.
The same goes for Citigroup, which pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chair Debbie Matz welcomed the welcome of the two cash houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is in charge of the U.S. cooperative banks and jumps into bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the billions of dollars in damages repaid.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also pushed other large banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a disaster for a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even though events have been a few years ago, there is currently a strong wind coming from banks in the US.
Investors and regulators have tried countless lawsuits to obtain redress or sanction misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of over-exploiting the two state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also faces a lawsuit from the FHFA, which involves several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand up for "substantial losses" without, however, specifying an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the demands as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the big American investor Warren Buffett had always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, because the long-term development of the companies can only be poorly predicted.
However, he has now read IBM’s annual reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight’s strike in the financial world.
Accordingly, the IT rock IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed on CNBC that he has been buying $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had still provided decent profits.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company calculators.
Buffett had avoided technology companies so far.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett approached a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway has around 80 own subsidiaries and shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it with wise investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of the Buffett investment, IBM shares rose pre-exchange by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, is worth more than $220 billion in total on the stock exchange, making it one of the world's most valuable technology companies together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he did not want to join.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media are doubting the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish people and one Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks, a long-deadly believed ghost returns: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is anti-alienism in Germany was never in question.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" was the headline of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators was supposed to have been a V-man of the constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the radical right-wing swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted sensibly: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a memorial guard outside the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colours, it had been staged together - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media looks like a slap: “Germany’s gift for the fiftieth” is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform “Haber X”, which covers the background to the murder series.
Nor can the German edition of the "Hürriyet" be taken to draw this mental connection.
“It starts to smell,” is the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He stresses that people were murdered who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
Extremely critically, German-Turkish Internet forums are discussing the police’s actions and their later success.
The authors wonder why the German authorities were not much more likely to find suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some people are at least rhetorically willing to use drastic means: “If it continues to be slaughtered, the migrants have nothing but self-defense and armament.”
“That will be the best self-protection.”
"Of the kindness of the enlightenment and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network, internal peace in Germany depends very heavily," writes Selen.
What it means when internal peace is in danger in Germany, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties made clear.
The photo of the Solingen fire ruins is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that suspicion and distance can lead to right-wing force.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of we on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, the failure of German politics after the attacks was criticized above all: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack in Solingen he sent a condolence letter to the Turkish president, but was represented at the mourning in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then counted in his speech how many levies the local Turks made.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated by the amount of his taxation.
The current Turkish media coverage shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been ever since.
In addition to efforts to enlighten and reassess far-right terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The bank of scandal of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is based not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since shrunk from one crisis to the next.
Now a German is to be judged.
Axel Weber probably didn’t think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grossbank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity and dropped friendly remarks about future colleagues.
"UBS made the turnaround."
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
In September, it became clear that everything was going to be different.
A dealer from UBS in London had circumvented all of the bank’s security systems and defrauded around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the board of directors of the UBS has since also been regarded as depressed - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he takes over the chairmanship of the Board of Directors already in May – not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather an economic professor and central banker and would certainly have needed an introduction time.
With one stroke he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proven once again that it deserves the title "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and, on the other hand, it has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid but also busy Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a very large number in investment banking as well.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger, says: "My students at the time, I always presented the UBS as a model of a good bank."
“From today’s point of view, you ask yourself: How could I be so wrong?”
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was revealed for the first time that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli surprisingly resigned, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank’s investment division had messed with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but ones that some would have been buzzing about until shortly before: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so concealed that one did not even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, with the resignation of Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, Switzerland’s second highest-paid Board of Directors in 2006.
In October 2008, the catastrophe followed: UBS faced a collapse in the face of its poor investments in the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, while the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced-walled bond, through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to house such large banks.
Finally, UBS’s balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," says banking researcher Geiger.
The first disaster followed the second.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have misled taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty.
The UBS thus acknowledged more or less openly that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
The resignation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors followed.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both core business areas: in investment banking due to misspeculation and in asset management due to tax evasion assistance.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought UBS would get it back, this unfortunate trader story follows: A single trader loses 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is wrong.
And it becomes apparent: with risk management in investment banking it is obviously still not working.
"With the case of Adoboli, it has been determined that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the banking institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have the risk control under control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago assumed to become guardians of the great fortunes of the world: no too great risks, but security for the money - even beyond the Alpine Republic could once collapse the world.
The vaults of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The head office of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are splendid, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany’s can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have lived here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
You enter the reception hall of the UBS through a heavy turning door.
Inside, the walls are marble-clad, in front are thick leather armchairs, next to the bench logo a big sign for the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has been supplanted by both large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point – or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does business with the two large banks, like all Swiss bankers.
The UBS has become much too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would have also spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if they did, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, first brought it high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-dollar country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book The UBS Crash.
Up to 68 billion francs, or around 45 billion euros, were granted by the politicians to save the large bank that was facing bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks merged into a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and it grew further and further.
The two different precursor banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came in favor of a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, chief executive officer of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, the modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked from banking to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger says.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear that exuberance came before the case.
Employees at UBS clearly remember the executive meetings, at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs kicked off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
The UBS wanted to go to the top.
Some steps had already succeeded.
She played at the top in foreign exchange and stock trading.
However, management consultants who were hired highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a tremendous distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime assets.
It evolved into a huge machine that packaged and distributed securities on American mortgage loans, but also retained risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for an exit.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said banking expert Geiger.
So great is the euphoria, so deep is the case.
One manager after another had to go away when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS have become a centrifugal seat and are still shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: stop investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go this far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of banking Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grubel.
In the meantime, he has asserted himself: he should permanently manage the business of UBS, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to its level in the mid-1990s.
3500 marks.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is surely asking himself now.
So far, he only says publicly that he and his wife will be looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens U.S. stock market
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors for the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The throttled industrial production on the continent choked hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in the bud.
The general easing about the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass had been considered half-full last week, not half-empty - but now the problems were pushed back to the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially financial assets were on the sales slips.
The Dow Jones Index of Standard Values traded at the close of trading with a minus of 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
During the course of trade, the market barometer ranged from 12,027 to 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The index of the Nasdaq technology exchange lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5,985 counters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing to end the recovery.
Companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to the Statistical Office of Eurostat.
“We’re not an island, we’re dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle overboard and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM backed the traditional group’s stock price and initially made it nearly one percent higher against the trend in the trade history.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares declined significantly higher than the market at 2.6 percent.
The house silvers nearly the entire remainder of its shares in China Construction Bank, entering $6.6 billion.
With the net profit from the business, the institute intends above all to boost its capital ratio and thus comply with harsher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased, thus limiting the losses in the Dow.
The share gained 1.5 percent after the group collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 777-type long-haul machines on Sunday and estimated the value of the order to be $18 billion.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume is even $26 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2,281 yielded and 79 remained unchanged.
At the Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion closed 630 shares in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, crows are considered "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities there are complaints from residents about dirt and noise from animals.
However, a remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows are no longer available from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian Void.
There experts from all over the federal territory discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the land escape of the particularly protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys the traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation and the falling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs can be found in Westphalia’s Soest, in the northwest in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county had provided negative headlines.
Critics had described catching the animals in bird traps and slaying them with sticks as particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, torment, brings nothing," said city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Sprinkling nests away with water or falling trees often have undesirable consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg said.
"The animals escape, large colonies split up and spread elsewhere."
Exceptions can only be made to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable a combination of torment of animals from sensitive living areas and attraction offers to resettle them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens advocated a completely different approach to the animals: "A pimple in the face can finally be tolerated best with confidence."
Jürgens had co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Asheberg Crow Teaching Path, on which signs inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise of the birds, Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: crows not only use tools to get to a treat, but even make their own tools as tools.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested four seed crows for how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to bring down a scaffold in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have in order to make the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had placed pieces of wire on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded in doing so at once.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are included in the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the final tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and perfected the fifth consecutive EM after 0-0.
The Czechs received a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off rematch against outsider Montenegro, after the first leg (2:0) had been a clear matter.
Nothing left Croatia to burn in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland won a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the next goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburger Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade yard (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) had cut twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed Portugal in the play-offs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal got a tailor-made start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo hunted a free kick from about 30 meters to the early lead in the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long shot qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance through goal hunter Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger of the English leader Manchester City put a headball to the lower edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the spotlight.
After an attack on Hero Postiga in the Bosnian penal zone, Stark decided on Swallow and showed the Portuguese the Yellow Card (36th).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trading meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic surely transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the final doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth consecutive European Championship in 1976.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to survive a scare second already in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot just past Cech's gate in the 40th minute from the penalty area.
After the break, the crossbar had to be saved for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had departed (50.).
The goal shortly before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey missed the Zagreb soccer miracle.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to almost certainly clear his seat on the bench of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croatians can be pleased with their fourth participation in an EM final.
Before 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan only hit the pole in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim also could not sink the jumper in the goal.
After the second of terror, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who made room for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were also on duty.
Trapattoni to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 win in the first leg, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) made up for the guests.
Ireland pushed the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back team prevent the possible leader striker.
In the 32nd minute, it was time.
After a crashed defense by finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to 1-0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer, SAP, is investing billions in China over the next few years and aims to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) will flow, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly,” Co-CEO Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from currently about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of offices of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are located in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, runs almost infrequently before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education.”
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Empathetic and generous begins Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Terror: A History of the First World War, told in nineteen fates" with a long list of main characters that draws you to heart.
Here’s a tip for what to do: Carefully cut this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund’s romantic narrative, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments when you, like Englund’s men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book which he does not incorrectly describe as "a work of anti-history."
It contains few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It’s less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather “a book about what it was like.” It’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods.”
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war combined, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flickers up like the votive candles in a church, some come in, while others go out.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that World War I was only the devastating positional war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" wanders with expert insights across other places of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
To the soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, a Christmas celebrated among the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina smelling like Cordite.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance. Stay or take flight?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged.
“Missing facts,” Englund notes, “were filled with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"Beauty and Horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmate.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories may be frightening or poignant, but they are extremely vivid in the entanglements of the accumulation of small moments losing in detail.
Many of them are deficient and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about substitute meals in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in ham fat (and last served with a fake bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes sown with wood."
There were, he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American recognizes his own urge to savageness and says about war: “You feel that, in spite of everything, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the chair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and pretending to mean such a fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind one’s own strengthened and strengthened.”
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will take note of it or take care of it.
“When you step away from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it’s as horrible as “a convicted man hanged in secret.”
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century": "the word clever and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a tailor-made suit who slaughter while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is as frivolous behavior as there is heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get infected with a sexually transmitted disease in a prostitute in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade of gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared themselves on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital in this way," he writes.
“Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, causing them to be blind for the rest of their lives.”
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes supple and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way in which war "uniquely unleashed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People begin to wonder why their leaders make them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly falsified such as Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West Nothing New" rather than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating end I have ever read in a nonfiction book.
I'm not giving it anymore.
But it's like he's snatched away this page with the main characters in front of our nose with his book and lit it with a match.
After an early misconception, a meticulously planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing operational helmets.
They had opted for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at this time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed; all the others initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the department and gave the occupiers an enormous increase in public sympathy, were not allowed to be repeated.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up the so-called chaos training — counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the commands, which spoke of a declaration as "exercise."
“The few police officers involved, as far as I know, didn’t know it was Zuccotti Park,” said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
“The only people who knew Zuccotti Park was the high-ranking officers of the department.”
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then left when hundreds of protesters gathered after they heard of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including operations commands from around the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people go in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 o’clock at night is a good time to go in.
“It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people are in the park,” he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready to depart on Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages thundering from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When public officials invaded the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack their possessions together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this was done for their own safety.
But many journalists say that they were trying to stop them from observing the police actions in the park, and they said that the officers' dealings were very rough.
Mr. Browne said television cars could have taken photos on Church Street on the west side of the park.
As the police moved towards the West through the great mess of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags with clothes, followed her by employees of the city cleaning, which picked up what had been left.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside, and pictures of them appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main nucleus of protesters occupied position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some set up barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied together on their arms.
And two people were chaining themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil Protection officials were called in to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to police.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, he said, due to “improper conduct and resistance to an arrest.”
The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Criminal Officers Department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly “did not conduct the operation,” as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials was waiting on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south.
It was possible to observe how from these locations the police expanded the perimeter further and further around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people outside.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of the caregivers will file a lawsuit against the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of schoolteachers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday because the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last opportunity left open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the redundancies.
Sixty-seven hundred and seventy-two school aides, care coordinators, and other employees who were among the city’s lowest-paid employees and had lost their jobs in a chess train on October 7 described the union leader as a political revenge for being denied access to a health fund that the working groups maintained in the city last year.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a city council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that there was nothing in the budget that specified that school aid workers would be fired.
37 city council officials said they had and warned the ministry of education of a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the City’s Ministry of Education as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Ministry of Justice, said the city did not file the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a lawsuit drafted by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals at schools in the poor neighborhoods of the city to support a lawsuit over unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
She states that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies at Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school aides were lost in Brownsville, Brooklyn, District 23, and 46 aides were released in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Finding the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says: "This is not a neighborhood of parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget for the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and money was lost as the city changed its method of extra-financing for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of high schools were misled through the language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" in the U.S. usually describes a teacher's move from a school's salary list to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been fired, not transferred," the draft lawsuit states.
Mission ended, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the cessation of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate’s Committee on International Relations passed a resolution that governs President John Kerry (Massachusetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators from both parties and the White House disputed the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving the US military’s role in NATO’s Libyan mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, however, the bill passed in the Senate, and the Chamber passed a decision to cut funds for US operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission fell into a kind of legislative purge -- with a Congress that, while angry enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, was not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell in August among Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations “congratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation” and “praises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they split legislators, as the June law did?
The last version encounters the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change to the budget or any other area that is currently coming to a vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to put their amendments to the vote, although they have tried it often enough.
Goodlatte’s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been presented to this Congress, covering a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been presented to both Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance budget amendment in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients—especially beginners with Republicans who want to polish their resume—the possibility of boasting that they have “written” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of office of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change prohibiting same-sex marriage is a recurring template, as is a change prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states reject them.
As eagerly as members propose changes, they are moving faster than they have been in recent years.
In the 111st Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress, 66.
The pace is fading compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Affected, but not defeated," Giffords said in the first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from close range during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night, singing alone to the Broadway song "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow," saying the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she struggled for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the severe slow recovery from the damage done by the bullet that shared her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her voice on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January assassination, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang — describing her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "Good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour “20/20” special recorded shortly before the couple’s new book was released: “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special tracks Gifford's recovery since the January 8 assassination.
In videos Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with his head.
A shudder with his lips.
And then, her first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you see the congresswoman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said she can’t remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he had read an article in a daily newspaper on March 12 about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forcibly treated while awaiting his trial.
“Many people have died,” said Gifford’s Sawyer.
"Hart, hard, hard."
As his wife recovered, Kelly Sawyer said, “I was hit.”
“So, I’d say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t defeated,’” Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you will endure this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala raising millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At one key word, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxes stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, watched, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then-Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know. I know.
But it was no respect, really not. It was pity.
The sharply contradictory impressions illustrate the severe relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly behaving as if people in uniform are suffering.
“We were by no means victims,” said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
“But apparently the only way to support is to press us into the role of unhappy souls.”
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that the returning troops faced in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion take place in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of reverence as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a “angry, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and after his return took over a high-ranking state position in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interrogators subtly asked whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
“When you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it,” Cancian told his sons.
The military’s lack of ease is partly rooted in the Americans’ lack of interest in war.
Performances on the battlefield are rarely taken as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism the way it was absolutely customary in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public largely focuses on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape before the military court.
If this does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12 pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan wiped her concerns aside.
I thought, "Well, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feelings."
A few minutes after they walked into Lyman’s room, the man stood behind them, pushed them down and raped them, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxious about a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, deciding whether a lawsuit they have brought against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not act against widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months it rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually abused by military colleagues, and that the military failed to investigate, convict or prosecute the appropriate assault.
Burke says she pursues the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchically constructed,” she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in the position to exterminate the culture of revenge? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, if necessary, they will file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court files, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court Act, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries to soldiers in active service.
“The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs,” the document states.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to service in combat, the distinction lies solely in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her fight: three more complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans’ Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a hostile atmosphere.
Independently of this, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America filed a lawsuit against the military focusing on the diagnosis of “personality disorder” that rape victims received to dismiss them from service – a common approach, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women’s Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed lawsuits against the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with benefits claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were submitted to Congress independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, providing a number of clues.
According to the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 reported sexual abuse in 2010.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the recorded cases came to court in the military, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe their attacks as just the first in a series of dreams.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the raid.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her assailant, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, and she was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six persons testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator who was ultimately acquitted.
“I still remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought the labors would begin. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure, that was my procedure.'"
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably released, so she received no support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs filed is moving forward is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he remarks: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging behind a decade because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence that a liability entails.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this respect until there is reform,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to committing an assassination in Norway in July in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in front of his computer until his attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
That’s easy – you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found it wasn’t hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply have to use the site’s advertising tool to accurately set their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy — just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with adds, but instead of connecting with a new band or a new diet product, the adds invited users to a survey asking about their educational status, their attitudes towards violence, and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
“It’s a fairly new research method,” Bartlett says.
Online sponsors of far-right groups are mostly young, male and annoyed by immigration.
But in a sort of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three contents per day, Facebook’s “Data Supernova” is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title by almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this site that you don’t usually reach with your clipboard on the street.
“If you used to try to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have granted them access," Bartlett said.
At Facebook, it all goes away – you go straight to them.”
Others say the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full rush on Facebook are significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who are silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that peer students, such as residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you haven’t realized it,” Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
“We’ve found a way to identify vulnerable children that wouldn’t have been found otherwise.”
Facebook is also constantly hacking the data of its own population.
The site’s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using data that only Facebook has access to – digital freedom masters have long known that the site should make their large data mine accessible for other research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not, and in order to be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to share its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have thought at all about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study in which he examined students’ public pages on Facebook.
"As for her, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn said.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and pencil are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
"Social research has to take care of the social - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
'Cold and Inhuman': Anders Behring Breivik Appears in Public Court for the First Time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two shootings in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a “resistance” fighter.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway,” he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
“I am appealing to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I recognize the laws, but I don't confess guilt."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who gave a pre-written speech, permission to turn to the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to hold Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks, and the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he remained behind bars.
Everyone participated with the goal that everything would end up being closed off.
“I thought he looked cold and inhuman,” one survivor of Utoya told Norwegian radio station NRK.
“It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect.”
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre indication that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may like that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But does that automatically ease the sorrow and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
“I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn’t,” a victim’s relative said.
“It would be so much easier if he did.”
7 Lessons From The Interview With The Deceased Steve Jobs Shown At A Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most insightful in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted this week before special film screenings in the major markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer, eager to craft charts - a man who believed that many executives suffer from "a disease of thought," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great one."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Idiots" about the break-up of the personal computer, and he spent more than an hour working on one of the rare, in-depth conversations.
By that time, it had been like 10 years since Jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, looking forward to the widespread adoption of the internet.
While a small part of Cringley’s interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing at delivery.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating detailed interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of meditation, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responds to Cringely’s questions and urges him to respond more quickly to more important topics or side actions.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview seems somehow eerily far-sighted when Jobs assesses what other companies are doing right or wrong in his opinion and represents his own vision for the future of the computer.
It’s one thing to read posthumous appreciations of Career Jobs, but to see Jobs here as the eager dreamer on the leap to grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"Throughout the years in business, I always ask, 'Why are you doing things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's how it's made easy.'
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in business really thinks deeply about things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs is continuing its efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Amazed at how costs were recorded - usually starting with "standard costs", which were calculated on the basis of mere assumption and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined down to the smallest.
How the Pope was dismissed:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could sneak into the telephone company and lead long distance conversations for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the boxes by using a paid phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while scrolling through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and when you go on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door,” Jobs says with a whisper.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he nearly pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself answered the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was searching for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It had a remarkable impact on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for it.
How to improve innovations:
Several times in the interview Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember punctuating arguments ... they screamed at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer.”
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we were able to build for $15. That was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are slowing down:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
“Let’s say you’re working at IBM or Xerox, so you’re making a better copier or printer, well what?”
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it’s such people] who ultimately run the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is eradicated by people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
This happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, Microsoft could have been the 1990s...
They have lost the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
“There’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it comes down to taste, it comes down to trying to deal with the best stuff that humans have created, and then trying to bring these things together into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who were randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas Dine With Opponents of Health Laws, As Court Adopts Case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became a buzzword among conservative activists across the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to kick off the 2012 presidential fight, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The attorney who will stand in court claiming that the law is to be overturned is likely to be Paul Clement, once a attorney general under the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual Federalist Society’s dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative principles of law.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, that challenged the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is heavily involved financially in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Republican faction leader in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform, had served.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges free themselves from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in charitable events of law close to and other organizations, without the judge being allowed to be a spokesman, honorary guest or according to the program to be a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, Scalia and Thomas’ extreme proximity to two of the law firms related to the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, were sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
“This startling break with morals and the contradiction to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges for lying, the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a beneficial event with lawyers with floating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support of a fundraising campaign for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they are too easy to mix court matters with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
Conservatives, on the other hand, claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a attorney general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to court in first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of bias, as she was too committed to defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make any effort to do so.
Boeing pulls record $18 trillion order on land
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 two-way aircraft with an option for 20 additional aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is aircraft maker Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft in total is at a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing’s client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest commercial aircraft order ever, based on the value of the order: 50 dual Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has, as Boeing announced in 2011 at the Dubai Aviation Show, an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which will increase the total listing price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8s were ordered, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stock market expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but a rise in oil prices, which usually harms airlines because this is one of their biggest cost points, is not as harmful as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
Emirates’ order reaffirms Boeing’s leadership position in the large-scale aircraft market and helps keep Airbus’ competitor SAS in check, which is attacking the A350’s dominance.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more trust after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI supported in the race for the governor’s post.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister apparently lost her bid for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, won the race for governorship in the Western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
“They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... They occupied election booths, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI].”
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory at Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have slighted Claderon, who had led in the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor still in office, came to third place, a severe defeat for the split and unhappy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies ties to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have left out of fear of local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us look boldly into the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the administrative director of the Manila-based ADB, said the two fastest-growing economic nations in the world must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that are looking “unpassionately” at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all in the same boat.”
“So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
“If China and India can help, then by all means.”
Europe’s monetary union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe fuels fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and has led to calls that the leading emerging markets must come together to support the eurozone.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support for Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF) – would provide greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy now suffers from declining exports and drying up foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
"We are facing great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because where else we can find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to the 1.2 trillion people in India for Europe, of whom more than 800 million live a day of $2 or even less.
"At some point they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, administrative director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public servants in Greece, with jobs in misdirected, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have “significant domino effects” across Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/threatens now "the risk of downgrading" due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would need to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital outflow of their vocabulary.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unnoticedly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to war venues in Afghanistan and civilian supply chains.
The Pentagon is already considering $450 trillion in cuts over the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress is unable to complete spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% overall cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such an unthinkable manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects impractical - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntarily separate from much of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certain probability limiting to be able to achieve the goal.”
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts were ultimately going to hit the fighting forces," Panetta said.
"While the anti-terrorism contingents are not directly affected by the seizure, serious interference with the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been cut, which would lead to delays in attitudes and hiring oversight that support the war."
“Personal salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
“The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would initiate a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they published Panetta’s letter.
“This is an outcome that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be pushed on.”
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their occurrence should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta’s letter and the new warnings from senators will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or will intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly voiced the potential cuts, although he has been able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he is facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what might be ahead - a military with a shell but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
“It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to carry out the mission,” Panetta said in his opening address to the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to accommodate potential opponents.”
“It really makes you angry.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details of how reductions “create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious constraints on our global capacity to deploy and engage, resulting in an unacceptable risk in future war operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it’s an important next step to armament so that potential dangers from China and other opponents can be banished.
How to Disguise a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how troubling and widespread deception and lying are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy dealing with accusations of sexual harassment by several women, both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury, allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was listened to when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign funding violations related to cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about cheating in school and at college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents where teachers have given their students the exam responses so that they can stand well on their own performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
But many of these lies are considered to be necessities.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game like Sharaden, in which the goal is to call "Haw Yourself!", uncovering a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths about lying have been uncovered.
Lies look into one's eyes.
They don’t always stotter, stem, blush, and twitch.
However, it should not be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and uncover.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the extensive and steadily growing field of disguise, and it is clear that disguising a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to find out in our complex world, especially when hiring or consulting people or negotiating or administering belongs to our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, arousing their interest and mastering their own emotions. And they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people that men are more likely to "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "orientated to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat").
We also know that when a person has been exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluating changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the vocal quality of your subject.
They should know better when someone usually tripped their foot constantly, so they don’t blame them wrongly if they tripped their foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that are screaming, not as evidence of disguise.
People who deceive may get frozen when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point toward the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the interview", that deep, relaxing exhalation and change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Askers often incorrectly signal that a job interview is over, only to look for this relaxation after the job interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your experimenter.
Scott Peterson's slipper is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving people can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or when you repeat a tricky question overall.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, which often causes the alarm bells to ring.
There is no magic to uncover lies, but you can learn skills thanks to which uncovering is possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can less often become a victim of fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Plan Revised After Endangered by Delayed U.S. Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned Canadian oil pipeline into the Gulf of Mexico, annoying trade unions while calming environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is striving to re-plan the project so that it can return to normal.
TransCanada said Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament Building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will ultimately be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after a foreign ministry announcement last week that a decision on federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course that avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply, has been reviewed.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Foreign Ministry may postpone a decision until 2013, following the elections next year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a responsibility of the foreign ministry and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was used to connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
The pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska’s lawmakers, who are against the plan, are weighing the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ current environmental impact study found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the Ministry’s chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process that focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s 2008 advisor, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged with allegedly forcing an infant to vomit out of fear
A New York family alleges that disco diva Patti LaBelle had a raging attack in the lobby of her Manhattan building that would have made her little daughter so scared that she surrendered to fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffers from "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year that stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergartener, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family outing.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk walked with her luggage and Genevieve on her arm into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped off her daughter for a moment.
“Someone came up behind me and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said, ‘Yes,’ and went to take her back in my arm,” she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t put your daughter near the door,’” Roseanna Monk said.
“I told her, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’”
She got angry and started to scold - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tilt water from the bottle onto me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,' said the mother of the child.
LaBelle stumbled upon the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that he had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls requesting comment.
The lawsuit is for an unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he does not charge a fee and plans the family to donate the money they receive to child cancer assistance.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is put to the test with a kindergartener who is carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate Opportunities Brake the Economy
In the first year that Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and black labour rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and raised great hopes for economic growth, is in the government. However, as a result of climatic adversities, growth cannot be talked about, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of losses in agriculture, but also placed tight limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6% in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development of 31.16%, which had a slowing effect on other economic sectors.
According to a report by the Mexican Council for Rural Sustainability on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, 78.03 percent of which was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has steadily increased unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografia observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53% of the working population. In the second quarter the unemployment rate rose to 74 percent in the first quarter, from September to September to September.
Lower liquidity
The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autonoma (UAS), comments that the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
“What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with a number of factors, including liquidity losses in the market as a result of the cuts in money laundering legislation passed in Congress, because for those who are prohibited to accumulate dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else,” he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also inherent in a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is due on the one hand to the problems of entry and on the other because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and are looking for work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, considering the high proportion of black labour, which, according to INEGI, encompasses 60.38 percent of workers in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and black labour are the lowest wages in Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexico Social Security Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Mexico’s government agency for labour and social welfare).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos up to September, which is much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to declining economic activity and rising unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years was recorded in 2011. According to the Secretaria de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to $ 630,597 from January to June, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to $ 5,143,312 in the same period last year.
The Secretaria de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) for its part recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debts
In the face of the economic crisis, the state government applied in July to the National Congress for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The state Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive effects of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be detected by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario López Valdés’s inability to govern obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (Mexico’s state chamber of manufacturing industry), said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the state government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. Hard work has to be done to regain the ground lost this year and in 2012 we have to do twice. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently aligned," he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said events such as the frost at the beginning of the year hampered and slowed the country’s economic development.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the main impacts is a slowing economy that is not sufficiently moving to create an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services, so we will close the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining the Call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana in Sinaloa, said that the state must be encouraged to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to re-establish the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloa," he said.
There's a lot to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will steer the government’s efforts in better ways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
“There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively, what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it,” he said.
Arrested for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 day sentences for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor's office announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a public health offence -- in this case, possession of marijuana intended for trading.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by the Mexican military during the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez road in front of guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the convicted person is still in the detention centre.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings planned in the Habitat, Rescue de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programs for migrants are in danger of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda said.
The head of the Urban Social Development Authority explained that although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in jeopardy because the state government has not paid the funds it is entitled to for the three programs exceeding 11 million pesos.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounted to nearly 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of the construction is expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and even though they should have paid us a part in July," he said. "To avoid being too late, we have already begun construction work, and they have already advanced far, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take up a loan of 7 million at the beginning of his government, which corresponds to the amount that the central government should have raised.
"This was the case with us in the last term, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not used to participate in these programs," he said.
Although the state authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance was requested to speed up administrative work and pay off the outstanding share as soon as possible.
“Almost 12 million they have to contribute, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us a penny.”
The court approves for 2015 the transition to digital television in Mexico
The conversion of analogue signals to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, under which the switching from analogue to digital signals must be moved from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree with details on switching to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes to allow the court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the draft of the lawsuit, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the Legislative Decree unconstitutional, since the Federal Telecommunication Commission (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the regulations relating to radio and television, and therefore the Legislative Decree would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and the provisions of the law.
In favour of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. After the lawsuits were accepted, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and stopped all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without invoking the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed disagreement with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government cannot regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by means of general rules.
"I also do not believe that doing so would impair the independence of the regulatory body," she also recalled that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it directs state affairs.
Replacing analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it results in better utilization of the radio spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, is a postponement of the benefit of digitalisation, which is a decision in the public interest that has not only technical aspects, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "required the action of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a set of features that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transition, with the government, despite having highly specialized facilities.
“It cannot be concluded that the government is entering into the powers of Congress with the issuance of the contested decree of law, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with,” she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not counted yet.
The possibility of counting single ballots is a reality in the elections in Michoacán this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9 the polling station had adopted a series of regulations to harmonize local regulations with the reforms of the states in election matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had neither his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice adapted to the reforms passed by Congress, so that these had not entered into force at this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the deadlines set for it with the argument of having no objections against it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional action filed by the local legislature and deemed the representative's vote on the constitutional reforms "invalid and unlawful" because it did not have the right to "decide or veto against it".
María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained in an interview on the possibility of individual vote counting that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there was now the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballots partially or completely.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results in the minutes do not coincide; the minutes on the counting and calculating of votes do not exist on an actual basis or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the minutes.
In addition, the total numbering of the fully completed ballots may be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the second-placed winner equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, the second of the said candidates.
Vote counting may also be made in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is determined that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second, in which case the electoral packages which have been subject to partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés landed on Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace, and on Monday the show of the dead and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the lieutenant's final will was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others killed in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila in a Mexican air force plane, where the people closest to the Colonel participated in the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At 12 noon, the Lieutenant-Colonel’s ashes landed in the mourning hall, which is on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, and where the family and friends came.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were investigated at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, and this corpse show was initiated by his former high school classmates and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, which he had always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant-Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it because they thought it would make him dizzy even on a truck, yet he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had driven to Zapopán to graduate his family member, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying an airplane.
A Last Farewell
The Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was dismissed with all honors under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. His honors were given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, head of school and pupils of the technological school of Saltillo.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which also the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority sat, crashed.
At 6:05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, to the front of the barracks, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his siblings and other relatives were already waiting for him.
The abandoned body was found on a plot on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel introduced the media to eleven people who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found gunned down in different parts of the body and shot to death at an abandoned finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at the mileage point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw the door of the country house, surrounded by a beige-brown wall, rising in locked angles.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately communicated to the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him lay another wearing a white top.
Almost a meter away was another person’s body wearing a red t-shirt and blue pants.
All three of them were on their stomachs.
According to the information obtained on site, the three people must have been murdered in another location, as no cartridge sleeves were found.
On the wall of the country house you can read inscriptions written by an organized gang of criminals to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Secretariat of State for National Defence) introduced 11 people, including a minor who were part of a crime committed mainly in the town of Cadereyta and who were associated with abductions, murder, halconeo and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, eight people were initially arrested and one prisoner released on 11 November in the Los Alveros settlement.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, and the detainees confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12th, at 6 a.m., military officers found a car without license plates with two occupants on their watch in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
When inspecting the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2:00 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who on sight of the military attempted to take flight.
They are charged with secret burials in the places General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The nominated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government that is supposed to offer the forehead of the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The nominated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government that is supposed to offer the forehead of the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of government.
It is expected that he will introduce a majority cabinet made up of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of talks with political parties on the formation of government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well set," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is battling a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by euro politicians to regain the broken confidence in Italy.
The pressure to hurry on Monti was further intensified by the fluctuating market situation in which Italian government bonds were subjected to interest rates of 7 percent for 10 years, in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government with all our efforts."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have opposed a government consisting of a majority of technocrats, which is forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
Monti’s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could once again result in a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks is also putting pressure on Montis by saying that a failure is a disaster.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurial associations, as well as with youth and women’s organizations.
Tuesday evening, the session will be closed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who in response to the crisis has initiated an extremely rapid change of government.
After a brief revival towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would step down, the costs of Italian government bonds have reached critical limits again as a result of uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
A bailout of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout framework.
Monti said his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should only consist of technicians, an indication of their concerns about the procedure imposed by pressure from financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties complicate the inclusion of people from political life.
The Spaniards have more opportunities than the Ticos.
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten over 50 international games are on the bounce.
Costa Rica has only one of the 22 convened 50 games behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendship game, which takes place today at 15.05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the World and European champions, number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection matches, the three-coloured team only has defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international matches.
He reached that number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players, who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England, have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League each year.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish fury in complicated playoffs at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters as part of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team pulls their last record: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who on last Saturday against England (loss 0-1 in London) reached a tie with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 games abroad.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain a new record of 127 international games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the football club Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's midfielder Raúl González with 102.
The number Hundert is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are left-back Júnior Díaz with 48 games and forward Bryan Ruiz with 45.
There were only five of them in more than 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 games are played by the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come to less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest are not even approaching the 20s limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
Spain’s historic goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored nine goals, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour in celebration of its twenty-year anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assured them that a dream will come true when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by bassist and co-founder Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview last week from Brazil.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: do you realize what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true for us as well.
This is just the second time we’ve played in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It’s exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you because the fans of the band are totally devoted, they experience the days before the concert intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us nearly 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we’re sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve put on in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played at some giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and are delighted with the jungle, which is why Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, these are excellent surfing areas. In this way, we learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we do not set any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with a lot of different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why did you?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Each one likes a different song, so the decision we’re going to play isn’t easy.
If we add two or three songs to the repertoire that we haven’t played for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that’s why it’s also interesting for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I think none of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years, and that sounds like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like ourselves and are thrilled to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have participated actively in the birth of Grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Occasionally a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are happy to still be friends with them all and we are honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It’s also very unusual for a band like yours to have stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate ourselves lucky to be still alive and also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and their music. We couldn't be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy; on the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find balance.
We make sure you don’t go on tour too often, because it’s too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came in because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what you created it without being a famous rock star.
What are your memories of Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years who had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed that it took us so long. We’re still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I listen to a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It’s always been a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and soccer.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her works, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several bands and we liked this band best, so we are curious to see what Las Robertas live has to offer. That will surely be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of.
Who were you influenced by as a bassist?
by so many+
Among the first to think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I liked.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive even though it’s no longer a fad?
I think we all don’t feel very attached to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else who came up at the same time. If they still matter today, I think that’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why did you?
That’s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might look a little light-hearted, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them. It's very dark songs.
I think as you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life—for example, when you lose a family member or a friend—that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to examine the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated on and under control four times.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga and his personal doctor told TV that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want it because he considered him innocent.
He has been operated on four times for tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight, along with other conditions such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been held in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was working secretly during his time in government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin its visit from Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region.
Mujica meets with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón on Wednesday, which, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the culmination of his full schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón’s support in the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community. This declaration was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrialized countries, and since January of this year there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to accelerate the concreteization of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "gray list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the commercial level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The moustache-bearded installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which is coming to the counters around the world this month, has been tailored from the very beginning to the features of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which can be played in three dimensions without special glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to tell us how the stereoscopy works without glasses," Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, who is responsible for the press specializing in Nintendo in Spain, told the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game developed by Nintendo for this console from the beginning" because hit items such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman stressed that although it is three-dimensional, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “affordable” video game that allows a fast, smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" included two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less-shocked users.
After that, the experts can make a "second round" on the different levels of the game, which are becoming more and more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without becoming a victim of the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensional.
This trip to the three-dimensional world also means the character’s return to a portable console, which hasn’t been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The mustard installer must overcome platforms spiced with dangers to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
Guatemalan President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he would approve the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to hold him accountable in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
Thus, the trial ends with the US request for Portillo to be extradited so that he can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision is based on independence from the judiciary and government considering that a decisive court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that he did not interfere in court decisions during his administration and that he accepted all extradition requests he was informed of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, are arrested.
Colom's action is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the undermining of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign, which was preceded by extradition, but the minister filed opposition and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organization was created to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated, was taken into account.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by many leaders of institutions and institutions that have worked with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions during the election season demonstrated the impartiality of Trinijove’s work.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city councilman Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the General Director of the Social Work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work so far done "is a good foundation".
For the president of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does,” he said.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was cleared
The homeowners occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 occupiers left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 have come to an end on Balmes Street.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they had illegally occupied at noon, and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The eviction was carried out on a court order without police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be checked," the house manager confirmed.
The occupants, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, and painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also carried damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business would have declined by 80% since the start of the occupancy.
The owner of the disco pointed out that the house occupants were competing unfairly because they sold the drinks for three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the disco.
In addition, the owner of the recreational venue had been notified by the neighbors for rest disturbance, while according to her statement the noise did not come from the visitors to the disco, but from the occupiers and especially from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, which according to the angry neighbors became more and more longer in the last weeks.
The managers of the disco explained that the harassment had been so great that they agreed with the owner of the building not to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that it had received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona's city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for the building to be evacuated immediately and to deal with the problems of civic coexistence and the coming down of the neighborhood.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in recent months the occupiers had entered all floors of the building and almost all apartments.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to crack down on the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people trying to break into the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the disputes over the fees, agree with the tender.
The tender for the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its reproach on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in numbers to New York’s Central Park.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, in the eyes of many, the park became once again the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and downwards (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park plays with this idea.
The role model was now not Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the Yogi Bear.
This was the case when the city issued a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further gateways to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's planning on putting goals on the land.
The question of itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in view of a reflection on the city the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme to which two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can resort.
And precisely this fact provides the fabric for one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to speak about the "front on the mountain" after the attack on the coast, insofar as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been held about the green apples.
“It should be assumed that Barcelona’s biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" carries a "lexical trap": one must not imagine it "as access to a park, but as a delimitation of areas where action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban development experience, regards the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers as a result of the "uncertainty associated with the design of a public space today" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan singing" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is its own limitation on what can be cultivated.
“Constricting something always means defining the next step,” i.e. exceeding it.
“You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [referring to the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real catastrophe.”
Modol, which is closer to the question, means simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", and for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronate of Collserola, which should not "come on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given its board the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a guide letter that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams created ("just the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the headline of this article is complex because the tendering conditions lack a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 competitions in cross-section," he says, "on the Axis Mountain-Sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
This, at least in his case, led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt is equipped in its entire length, creating a smooth transition between the city and green zones.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of Casino Red released the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the lawsuit against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the representative of Casino Red has pardoned him before the Second Criminal Court of the district, which is leading the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for blackmail.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, who allegedly forced him to pay a sum of money for the city administration to approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the prosecution, the prosecutor opened a criminal case against the brother of the panic mayor, who was detained for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Old Quarter of the capital.
He stayed there for 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta detention centre for allegedly bribe the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, but he remained only a few hours in the middle security department because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, sent him an arrest order, stating that after the nearly two-month investigations, there was sufficient evidence to convict Jonas for paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the gambling hall to open it in return.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor’s brother, to release the penalty, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público assigned to the court, García Gómez, asked whether he had corrected the damage and who the owner of the gambling house had forgiven, but the lawyer withheld the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely pronounced. Nor can any objections be filed against the trial, nor is any compensation required.
After hearing the representative of the betting house at about 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been acquitted and his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announced details of the plane crash in which government Secretary Francisco Blake and seven others were killed.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport - SCT (Secretariat of Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed indicate that the helicopter with its entire intact structure crashed directly into the ground without the pilot having been able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at 25 meters altitude, with the helicopter losing the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the aircraft had crashed.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an inclination of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but these could take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, General Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter had flown from the Presidential State Mayor at a speed of travel and that the plane had fallen to a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the collision."
During a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, noted six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visible flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at take-off, with some low-hanging clouds picking up during the flight to the Mexico City-Mexico border area.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the helicopter's last radar record match. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date suggests that the helicopter was impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter with its intact structure had impacted the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft do not indicate fire or explosion at the site of the accident.
The latest results suggest several ground contacts.
In the field investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has an inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter was likely to have broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a thorough search of an area beyond the locked area at the accident site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, further reinforcing the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had crashed into the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
The Social Security Agency of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Agency of Mexico) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence" to find the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI Clinic, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers has been set up.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested participants can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 am tests are carried out with children and adolescents.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of Mexico) and will continue since October 8 at the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of Mexico).
If the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will be continued at the Independencia sports ground (in the south of the capital district) and completed at the Morelos sports ground (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study is to learn about the factors and role of genetics associated with the development of obesity and identify risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he said that the aim was for three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 to complete nutritional questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and family history of disease to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He further stated that on those Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, height, waist circumference), their blood pressure was controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify genes related to obesity in childhood) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health personnel about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in nearly six years the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differs from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average Mexican is 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity is expressed in the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the subjects would be a comprehensive study of the children, in which it would be determined whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and inner arm (akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors will explain to the parents all measurement results and suggest to them lifestyle changes that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for obesity, obesity, and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV, and using means of transportation, instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high intake of fat and protein, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents punctures
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs emanating from the road surfaces were considerably taken into consideration, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 puncture holes if the rainy season erupted in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, warning and assuring the number of the punctures that if the
In his lecture "Batholes from a Technical Perspective", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road coverings and thus avoid the appearance of punctures.
He explained that asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, some of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes. Together they give the road surface its characteristic elastic behavior.
The tensile-elastic behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180° C., at 120° C. it is very viscous and almost solid at 50° C., while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City have mostly a flexible road surface that is composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones, made of asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer had been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows for a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "a last layer is laid out, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which has also been bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it must produce friction.
This road surface receives and distributes the most forces, the support layer also needs an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water, "he said, because it significantly impairs the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain gets moist, water penetrates into the layer and is difficult to get out, causing all layers of road surfaces to soften and, as a result, the appearance of puncture holes.
When a punch hole is created, the top layer is first removed, while the wear layer is not damaged until afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the appearance of striking holes, so the thickness of each layer of road covering must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with to avoid frequent striking holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, such as asphalt emulsions that are already on the market in other countries, and with which the puncture holes could be repaired easily and without applying high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th missed title.
Once again Valle del Cauca went out empty when the crown was awarded to Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for standing on the winning podium, showcasing a silver crown and the band that she identified as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes to 14 mistitles, and Melina joins the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca (Alga<0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA3>o) (1987), Alga<0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA3>o (1987), Alga<0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA3>o (1987), Alga<0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA3>o (1987), Alga<0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA3>o (1987), Alga<0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xA0>
The big question that many today ask themselves is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite, who at each show had shown that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been elected Queen of the Police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered crucial to the jury’s decision to appoint her as First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question “Which book has influenced you the most and why?” that was put to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe pretty much in literature, I think it’s a way to civilize, ultimately I think the book that most shaped my childhood, ‘The Little Prince’, is a pretty deep book.
Currently I am reading <0x60>Debt and Atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that calls <0x60>Passions'.
A response that encountered little counter-love, firstly because of the term 'civilize' and secondly because it had not concretely explained how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after the ceremony concluded, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it is happening what needs to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favorite, who received all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (gastronomy competition Easter, audience voting on the best handmade costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, which therefore did not shine on the stage."
And this was noticed on her first performance in the swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and on her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she appeared safe with both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program on RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will not, after all, become queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury about their interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason that two days before the international jury assembled Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
“Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had worked on projects before participating in the competition,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her derrial and fibrosis defects that were noted in her stomach area, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for <0x60>natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The queens’ coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, “but her problem with fibrosis in the belly, which was honestly hard to notice for me, squeezed her score on the last day.”
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
“Operations are okay, but Valle didn’t know how to get them done right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay.”
Because of this prize, which was awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction emerged after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was supposed to come true at night. It was tucked that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting her reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia.
However, as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, escaped the crown, she will go into history.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A lophoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4th, a lophoscopist from the Cali Prosecutor’s Investigation Unit (CTI) came in as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), “Alfonso Cano” by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had been on standby, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he settled in Valle above and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of action against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something great awaited him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was to identify two bodies, and that there was suspicion that one could be that of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was to take the ten-finger print sheet by Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was most investigated, he could not identify it because of its physical appearance, for it was not in the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a local farmer, didn’t wear glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planting cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was in fact the head of the FARC.
On track search
The appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use against "Cano" was very important for a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false identification documents or they have none.
We take their fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that in the event of a theft, he had to tear a piece of a wall out of a house, because the thief had leaned with his hand exactly at this point when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for taking fingerprints, but in this case we were able to take the entire handprint and identify the offender who participated in multiple thefts,” he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or charged.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by bottles of liquor.
The investigation suspected a family member to be suspicious, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, he is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that “the fingerprints would be taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents.”
When they appear, a plant cellar or ribbon is used to carry.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Personal Status Office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID papers," said the expert from the CTI.
He said not everything was as it would be depicted in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is what shines, not all you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "infuriated" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
Much of it followed the eviction order and changed its location to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday as they tried again to enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being cleared of the square at dawn and trying to occupy another seat on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, where they sought a court order to allow the "infuriated" to re-tent at the site, while another part of the movement held the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests were made.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray stated that the “infuriated” response to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent eviction of the square and allowing the protesters to tent.
In addition, the "Infuriates" occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but afterwards the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give accurate numbers. He assured Efe news agency that he also saw several journalists handcuffed.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had gathered at this point, where a deputy of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing, which is scheduled for Tuesday, and in which the legality of the eviction at dawn is to be analyzed.
Some of the protesters driven by the square carried and distributed photocopies of this court order and even gave them to some police officers guarding the square, which resulted in "some small clashes," according to Bray, who had reported that some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that this court order had lifted the reopening of the square for public transport and the protesters, pointing out to the protesters that city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the early morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters “violated the right.”
Bloomberg said he gave the order to clear the square because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people," because "some businesses would have received threats" and residents "frighted about their quality of life."
“The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers,” the movement’s spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “not respecting press freedom.”
Occupy Wall Street officials said they were considering organizing “big actions” for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months of the protests since Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit on "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model on a Canadian TV Christmas show will be the Virgin Mary.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today disseminated images of the television program in which Anderson - which also appears for the Internet distribution of a self-filmed porn, in which she along with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - appears as the Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap that is supposed to portray Jesus.
The scene features Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently worked as a host on Charlie Sheen’s “My Violent Torpedo of Truth,” as a child of Jesus.
CTV’s Christmas program not only relies on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York City, Bublé described North American Kim Kardashian as a "whore".
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the free-fall spiral from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, which is still in recovery after the destructive earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe Japan had experienced in World War II.
The first estimates by the government in Tokyo valued the property damage at $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three-quarter cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were used to finally conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at the rate calculated on the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decrease for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has awakened in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - flees into one of the "refuge currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the gloomy forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that lays a tombstone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
“We need to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the yen,” Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy, said yesterday.
The prospects are really not very encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states showed clearer signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, brought to light that the greatest economic potentials would have slowed down.
It fell by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below that average, which is 100, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says austerity measures would be passed, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With peripheral countries’ rising risk premiums and widening uncertainty, Greece is also wandering further into the labyrinth that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly being proven by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon when he was appointed may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and in no way back his call for the February 19th elections.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara’s statement does not clear any doubts about his position: “We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else.”
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that needs to unblock the $8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he would not approve a commitment to comply with the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the Papandreou referendum poker game, reiterated yesterday that its demand should not be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "do not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
Ministry of Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section" of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knot still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has become the second donor of international cooperation in the world, whose "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on trust in mankind".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth world summit on microcredit in Valladolid, she was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely indispensable" in order to achieve the millennium targets set by the United Nations by 2015 and "especially the goal of living the number of people with incomes of less than a dollar".
Spain "continues to work" on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it performs this task responsibly", remarked the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will start from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" are mainly guaranteed loans.
“We’ve had a lot of success and we’re facing a lot of challenges.”
The summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for pushing "two fundamental goals".
The Queen said that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that 10 million of these households will cross the poverty line.
The conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia judges as an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as an “admirable idealist committed to fighting poverty” and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the local lending strategy.
A year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006 followed, all of which "we have been able to observe a continuous evolution," the Queen explained, whose commitment to this project earned her yesterday the assessment as "family leader" in Valladolid and as "speaker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her talk by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to find solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said solidarity was an “ethical requirement” for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic booms, since it was a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said that microcredit is a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and that the governments of the industrialized countries should now "more than ever" work according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the "most important forms of development assistance".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, decried "the success", "marginalized" people, "who are always standing before closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present in a city, the "their gates" open by the spirit of solidarity.
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU) in Leipzig on Monday, November 14, passed for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and chair of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, in particular to provide for those activists who consider government policy towards the Greeks to be too lax today and possibly Italy tomorrow.
The Presidency proposal of the European Commission proposed by the Bureau was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against it, and ten abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted several minutes and which, due to their interventions, was first valid for Angela Merkel and a few hours later for Wolfgang Schäuble, was not in doubt on the part of the three European finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea is, like the request, the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro”.
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a revision of the Lisbon Treaty, which reinforces the control of the European Union, with regard to the budgetary policies of the countries in the eurozone; however, this could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, to which Wolfgang Schäuble was clearly the godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been laid.
Likewise, the delegates, with an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal of weighting each country in the Executive Board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously would lead to a strengthening of the position of Germany.
The Chancellor, thinking of calming the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, who would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
To the extent that the European proposal devotes a paragraph to the significance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle.
One of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the sickness fraud represent?
UMP and the government are now tackling the sickness reports after the family benefits.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family benefit fund and present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
To accompany this attack, which is based on an effort to put the economy to a hard test, but on the other hand is no less than a foreshadowing of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers' sickness reports.
First of all, with a budgetary objective: the government is aiming to introduce a fourth day before taking into account a sickness report for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without permission from the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A move that, according to the daily "Les Echos" threatens to incite anger, but would help to contribute 280 million euros.
And that would be accompanied by another rather symbolic measure: granting state officials an unpaid day of leave in case of illness (until now, in contrast to the three days of leave in the private sector, there is no such period of leave for them).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also reignite the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with work absence.
"Controls will be much more important, and moreover, they will be reimbursed if required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13, at RTL's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report seems somewhat disproportionate in terms of the reality of fraudulent activities in the field of sickness reports.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as of political offensives that have borne the most fruit.
French people are no more likely to be ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first dwell on the country-wide digits.
According to CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily payments were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Healthcare, daily allowances amounted to 5% of health expenditure in 2008 at 11.3 billion euros.
Of these, 46% fell for maternity leave and occupational accidents and 54% for sick leave, which amounts to 6.2 billion euros.
2.5% of health expenditures.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, an average of only 14.5 sick days were granted to French people in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
One mean that covers up some differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 interviewed French workers reported not having taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, clarifies that 37% of sickness reports in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are therefore no more likely to be unable to work than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absentee rate (caused by illness or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness fraud represents a vanishingly small proportion of black work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak extent is achieved here.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on sickness reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public College for the Education and Training of Technicians and Engineers) found under 1.5 million checks that 13% of the 285,000 short-term sickness reports realized, which is called in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the systematically controlled sickness cases lasting more than 45 days, there were less than 1.2 million 11% "unjustified or inappropriate" cases, which is 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have filed a sick report.
A digit that represents only a weak proportion compared to, for example, that of black labour.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of day-to-day remuneration, and thus significantly more than the defrauding of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
This was announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the Prime Minister said in his first public address at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the eurozone would be at stake," he added.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos has planned to reduce the country’s government deficit “by 9%” of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after this was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right-wing rejects the new savings
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his approval on Monday to the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not be willing to declare an additional savings.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of his party's New Democracy.
He had agreed to the requirements of reducing budget deficits and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would stop economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the economic and monetary commissioner entrusted to the EU, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, had answered that his word was enough and he would not sign anything under pressure from outsiders.
Euthanasia and accompanying free death must be legalized, says expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, including beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal to die.
Only 9% of Canadians actually allow themselves to talk to their doctor about conditions in which they wish to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts linked in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This panel recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, in patients deemed capable of making such a decision.
In the beginning, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “health care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid of cutting the issue of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to pain relievers, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians wishing to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in hospital.
From a country-wide perspective, the rate of hospital deaths in Quebec is the highest with 86%.
In the sensitive issue of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are in line with the position of the federal government, which has already indicated that it does not wish to make any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
But now, according to the experts, who have similarly inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanying suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would result in misuses in their application, i.e. the practical implementation of euthanasia or accompanying suicide by incompetent or inconsent individuals.
On the contrary, there are significantly more cases of such violations, especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Even accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here,” said Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
According to an Angus-Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already paid for euthanasia because they believe it allows people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalized does not lead to the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are of less value.
Regarding people who have already committed accompanied suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
Regarding the maintenance or discontinuation of remedies in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Likewise, they suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the withdrawal of the funds for which a legally valid rejection has been submitted should not be considered criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the discontinuation of means at the end of their lives, and without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, including beyond cancer cases.
Lastly, with regard to the pain-relieving or life-threatening remedies already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the Panel calls for at least consideration of these, since they were not used to reduce physical pain, as was euthanasia, and they relate to the same procedures.
Concerns of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already raised concerns about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada’s expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the experts signing the report as "extreme" because it sets no limits on the euthanasia practice of patients in the final phase.
“This opens the doors to a situation where anyone who is life-threatening and over the age of 18 asks another person to help him with his suicide,” said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place individual responsibility over all other values involved in society’s social fabric.
Now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed "strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she called a "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts reports of the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damascus denounces "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad’s partisans demonstrated in front of the foreign ministry authorities yesterday.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, which, however, thanks to Russia’s support, opposes a “complot” directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League’s exclusion of Syria, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, even though Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, had taken a position in favor of President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the incumbent Arab prime minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to “put down his power in Syria”, which had already killed around forty civilians and members of the government power.
"If Bashar was interested in his country, he would step down, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, complained that the Turkish mediation attempts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave," he said, referring to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily harder stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have set an ever-increasing tone in the face of repression in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government power were killed in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed in "fire changes and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless believed that the country was "controlling the end of the crisis".
He has, by the way, responded with emphasis to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he believes is a "dangerous step".
“Syria will not give in,” he added, adding, “the plots forged against Syria would fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a “protection mechanism for civilians” and wants 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to be sent to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favor of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime that he encapsulates in his "paranoia".
An extraordinarily planned new assembly of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the emergence of the crisis, decided on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, likely withdrawal of military forces from the besieged cities and the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the decision of the Arab League "incorrect" yesterday to avoid advocating for possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.

Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to be self-sacrificing
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that would demand “victims” to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today’s meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet into parliament, which is composed relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, had been waiting for Mario Monti to cast a vote of confidence in parliament by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation presented by Mr Monti of a deletion list, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness in the stock and bond markets took their time.
In a “democracy there are certain deadlines” to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, noting that it is “sure that the markets will be dull and discreet.”
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the turmoil had intensified, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister should establish a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Monti has committed himself to working urgently to make Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe since taking up his role.
A spokesman for the European Commission, Olli Rehn, stressed that "it does not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy even considering the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of budgetary compensation in 2013 despite the austerity plans taken up in recent months, has in particular called for new toughening measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, Chief of the Chiefs of Italy, who will meet in Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic stimulus, as a country that has no growth at all, which cannot respect deficit indicators.
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" and a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, since Italy has to pay for 200 billion euros of government bonds from now until April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran’s Nuclear Energy Programme
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon explosive capsule, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risk confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report by the International Agency for Nuclear Safety (IAEA) and other documents issued by this UN agency to identify this scientist.
The IAEA said last week it was “seriously concerned” about a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to in-depth study of the IAEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was said to have left the center to start a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentioned “strong evidence that the Iranian development” of a nuclear explosives system “has been supported by the work of a foreign expert who is not only first skilled in this technique, but also, as a state member of the agency informed, his entire professional career through this technology was indispensable directly to the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin.”
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and offences against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes have either declined slightly or increased slightly, according to FBI statistics published Monday.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased by 49% from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, while there was a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews and a global 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases in a very weak proportion, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes grow again," Human Rights First said. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First had long stressed that violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, an official at the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these attacks,” he added, arguing that this could be done by improving the police’s stance on “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" is represented in American federal law as a legacy from the epoch of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after Martin Luther King’s death to punish acts of violence directed against race, color, religion or ancestry and now also involves crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is more and more similar to Facebook
Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to specifically allow its users to watch the activities of those following their entries, making the service resemble that of Facebook once again.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" allow better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") you track and who track your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track their messages, whether they are subscribing to new posts, favoring certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet spread on Monday "in August on a small percentage of users," Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with some esoteric-sounding wording (RT zum referenzierten Wiederholen der Beiträge eines anderen Menschen). followfriday <0xC3><0xA0> recommander de suivre une noutre usere) doing the happiness of the insiders, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the networks of the general public Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" via the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive, and too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 writes.
“The ‘Activity’ feature will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter,” said <0x40>dannykronstrom.

Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
The government of the large social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "golden budget rule" in the constitution to reduce public deficits and also avoid a possible degradation by rating agencies in the top-bonity of Austria (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, despite the fact that the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, which is well above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency hadn’t dropped to AA+ from AAA, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria also accepts a call from the Brussels summit of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: the heads of state and government at that time had called for the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public account balance in the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The action taken by the Austrian government in this regard resembles the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 onwards, the state’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% GDP limit, while regional states and municipalities should have balanced households.
The objective is to eradicate budgetary debt within the horizon of 2020/21 under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authority would intervene in currency markets again if the yen continues to rise.
“If we see excessive volatility” in the yen exchange rate, “we will intervene just as we did the last time,” Mr Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen again rushed close to the historic levels that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against the dollar to lower the Japanese currency value, which is about to raise a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has steadily risen above this, doped by purchases by investors who view the yen as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped below the symbolic bar of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar traded by 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it costs the cost of "made in Japan" products and reduces the value of income drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange it for domestic currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast," said Noda, who fears that the Yen's prosperity could kill the weak upsurge in the germ.
The third world economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - gained traction again for the first time this year thanks to the jumping export increases and the consumption of the households "sealed" by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the yen’s inefficiencies do not reflect “Japan’s economic foundations.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to dismantle the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, however, has notified that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", making it apparent that no further currency easing is expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to pay off the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of cover it spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates rise quickly, exchanges make retreats
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis constantly undermines European metrics.
Despite the inauguration of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The exchanges, which are still worried about the stability of the eurozone, also drifted a little more into negative areas on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
“Due to new tensions over yields on government bonds in the troubled eurozone, global stock markets continue to issue some of their recent gains.
"Capital investors are nervous and only well aware of the risk of infection," said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters news agency.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which suffers from the renewed fear of market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a 0.7% decline.
“Japan has looked at Europe as well as the rest of the world, and trading is moving on a limited corridor of variation as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is damaging to the single currency, which continues its rush on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m. the European Valuta was worth 1.3570 dolls, so it gave in by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange brokers, it has fallen after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had assembled in Congress on Monday, had accepted a request that provides in particular the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return on Italian bonds reached 6.85% at 10 years, with Spanish bonds maturing to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the South, but also in France, continue to feed investors’ fears.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by paralysis by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Eurozone summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the vizier of the markets, as on Sunday the parliamentary elections take place in the country.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historical high.
Expecting growth figures in the eurozone
Statistically, France recorded a household-driven economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the declines in the second quarter figures, with a minus of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it’s the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first reckoning of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the European Commission warning of the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it probes the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, not a huge proportion of the world’s population is supposed to have to do without a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity consistently, without forgetting the compelling need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision subject to the need to find a substitutable alternative source, nor in Switzerland, which is currently planning to build only the latest generation of nuclear power plants.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided after Fukushima to add another unit to its park by restarting the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, oriented on renewable energy sources, is occasionally presented as a model, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will reflect an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal-fired power plants in the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on imported gas, in particular from Russia.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
On the one hand, Denmark is the European leader in wind energy, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
Since the energy price is a key competitive factor in the global economy and a pledge of stability for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a sharp increase in the price of energy, which made the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are just as unwilling to pay as they are against the principle of this energy source.
Let us bear in mind that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a host of specialized small and medium-sized companies to international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France decides to phase out nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual €6 billion in exports of investment goods and nuclear energy would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would hire an EPR designed to function for sixty years, if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is no such thing as a devil’s work as a miracle remedy for generating electricity.
The low-CO2 solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that conducts uncompromising and transparent checks on existing plants, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their working teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just obsessed with the idea of safety.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, so it went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was invoked by reactor construction as well as indefensible human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two unprecedented natural disasters that caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the previous two.
As a result of this approach, as well as the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a design that enables it to be resilient to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to take the lead position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is inevitable and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country as well.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students from the official side had shaped the weekly shows, the Interior Minister had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "had no need for talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a wide-ranging consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
From the right, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", from the left, by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990, that France "cannot accommodate all the poverty in the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 from both right and left.
From both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity one is willing to admit to immigrants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande’s program limits itself to banality that indicates that partnership development allows us to solve our “migration problems”.
This conception of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may potentially affect elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of immigrants on economic growth, immigration and immigration.
Reducing immigration would de-empower growth and damage the labour market situation.
Fears of the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute for local workers, especially those with lower qualifications, by putting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than local wage workers, since they are primarily engaged in occupations in sectors that are untrained in the workplace.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local wage workers, while the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country with a lack of anesthesiologists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and domestic labour market situations between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants will result in a related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas introduced by immigrants is conducive to economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in European countries on average around 1% of the overall budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person who is 30 years of age and who is coming to Germany contributes an average net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after being invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed through the entire 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Superior in Greece.
Some believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy conquer its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a characteristic of the attitude of mind.
The general right to vote, the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can just as well become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe we are in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and above all a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek True False referendum would have had a double revealing character in this respect: once the need for a powerful return of politics, but on the other hand also those of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have shifted today, and that Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from pushing for a success of the national referendum, which has been organized according to necessities and in the wrong order.
A free ticket for the European solitary ruler or a leap with blindfolds into the emptiness of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, in full law, clarified and steadily, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - it is no longer known where to end the enumeration - since there is only one crisis, and that is the case in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that bows to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is worried about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each of the nations affiliated to it.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to the people's sovereignty.
For it is up to the whole whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and advance a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is a condition for decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without surely leading us to destruction.
After this proposal has been opposed for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, today everyone is urging European economic governance to do so.
I agree.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it envisions the citizens - would be another folly and another dead end.
We need to take a new stage of European integration.
In order to create the republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to create a better integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European sovereignty of the people.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become a common good
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday in an optimistic stance.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the contactless technology that enables payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards were to be sold worldwide this year!
Its market share is expected to increase even further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payments after it has been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visas were distributed.
However, consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million MasterCards this year.
In order to move faster, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically handing out bank cards with contactless chips to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile
However, this is only a first step on the way to the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
So far, a very small percentage of devices have been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
“They are late.”
"But they should experience real upward development at least next year."
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
The banks are taking initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
The Société Générale also announced yesterday that it would be preparing to launch an offer that would allow its customers to make contactless payments via mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and the relationships of the intelligence services indicate a clear cooperation," he said without going into detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
Investigations into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January have led to more interactions.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi supporters, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers in an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators say they have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the debris at the scene.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the conducted phone calls leads to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt that we must wait for more clear evidence before we can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
“However, it is conceivable.”
"It has been known for years that the cult receives financial and intellectual support from outsiders and that this is becoming increasingly active," said Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more apparent, as have the speeches and modes of operation of Boko Harem, which now indicate the use of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives bearing the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to start with Washington, has since exerted pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact for a long time regarded the group as a community of Illuminati that does not have to be given special attention.
Fast success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haussa means "Western education is a shame" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this impoverished region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict adherence to Sharia law, while its affiliated activists engage in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in sight.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active with their intensified attacks against the commissaries.
However, the reaction on the part of Abuja is, as usual, indifferentiated.
The army encircles the city, counting 800 dead.
The imprisoned Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was convicted of a suicide bombing that took place in Abuja, the first of its kind.
In August, the local United Nations headquarters will become a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to run from Mauritania to Nigeria and Somalia, has been of concern to all security experts ever since.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis operating from al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé, during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, warned of Boko Harem and said he was ready to "release all hints".
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like this, voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their colleagues have repeatedly made their thunderous statements as well as their statements regarding foreign policy, a traditional Republican focus.
Over China, Iran and Israel's aid - often unfounded in any way - slogans fall.
The Mitt Romney, who is the highest in the line for the nomination of the “Grand Old Party,” threatened to quote the Chinese to the WTO and accuse them of “currency manipulation” – a leading issue in an America that has been incited at the outset by the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
It has been foolish if this is to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has nearly threw himself up in regards to his emotionally flattering behavior.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of conversations with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard, as he stagnates in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran in case sanctions to stop the nuclear program failed.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama gets re-elected, they get the bomb.”
In addition, he promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty of this partner’s commitments.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest-placed candidate, for his part bears a shameful ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat as Beijing "tries to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has already had military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, for his part, is ready to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Contrary to the current presidential counterparts, Reagan also had simple ideas and despite all this won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, which was the issue of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive talks with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also earned him a reputation of weakness.
However, this hostility is not quite so casual.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive record of national security under Obama, which has turned Bin Laden off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding itself against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama is more appropriately surprised by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas transmission line, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is expected to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with brilliance and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas line, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level, on Tuesday at the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sound and at the gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically jointly turned the control of the valve that transports Russian gas to the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gases are to be delivered to Western Europe each year through a first pipeline of 1,224 km length connecting the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the eventuality of the construction of a third line on the same route is already announced.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little bit of their power: it will now become more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not shy from comparing the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive at first.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of de-energizing European energy, as the project has broken a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In barely five years, Russia has achieved its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, which have high gas consumption and whose gas reserves are on the decline.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which large gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers, who are numerous in Lubmin, regarding gas supply.
The construction of this gas transmission line is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel with concrete sheathing, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea floor, at about 200 m depth.
During its construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be evaded.
“About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precautionary measure,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers distanced themselves from it, as the Swedes were little keen to see a Russian state-owned company permanently settle at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of a disaster, we will close the gas passage in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers to be unlikely, since the suede seams were estimated to be at a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled for external observation by a seagoing vessel and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, has a diameter of one meter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and is moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas transmission line was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated (each 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company on a renewable 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how much gas it actually transports," Jens Müller said.
The financing of gas transmission construction was covered by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs are expected to amount to €7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the total investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are willing to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline comes to light on a sandy, pine-wooded coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas transmission lines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent with candlelight writing.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell-colored sides, as if aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, headquartered in Milan, decided at the time to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company’s specialist consultant, is tasked with launching the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique, called Mole Skin, which designates a cotton coat that is used, for example, for upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered to be an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established themselves with a sales volume of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook thrills businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small, Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs more than 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centres and understands how to assert its identity.
“We have followed the zeitgeist and its new writing needs, which persists despite the rise of emails,” said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a cover with leopard patterns on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural spirit of time and understood to diversify its products: bags, appointment calendars, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the entire range of items.
In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today is the 15th week of work for the disabled.
Despite a deliberate public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is always twice the average: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
Discouraging?
“No,” said <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which is organizing the ‘Work Week for the Disabled’.
“The progress made in 15 years is significant.”
"The unemployment rate at that time was not twice as high, but three times as high."
“Nonetheless, there is still a lot to do.”
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for the disabled unemployed before they can get a job.
More often it affects the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no high school education and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with a higher education degree.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared with 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter work and that "form the core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
The unspoken remains, the attitudes of mind, which are certainly developing, but are slowly developing.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entrepreneurs for La Cité magazine said that the managers surveyed had "a weak level of knowledge about the disabled" that was "overrepresented" by "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually underprivileged".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go in order to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was set out in a 1987 law.
These last figures, which date back to 2008, refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
“We are now at around 3%,” said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization tasked with collecting contributions from companies that disobey this law.
The evidence: The number of "fees paid" establishments has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for contribution increases, created strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real recognition, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments employ between 20 and 49 employees, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a Happiness"
Even before they offered their foreheads to the Blue Tuesday nights (20:45am), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasure from the friendship game.
It would be too far-reaching to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks of symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assured the native Liller.
Regarding the contrast between his representation in the club and the national team, "It is a unity that justifies everything."
“I’m in Lille all year round, which isn’t the case in Belgium.”
“It’s time for me to start.”
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "gloss".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He has fired the French national team since the age of 7 and led his winning campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supported,” he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to further strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
“We just walked over the way.”
"To be allowed to play against them means great happiness!"
Leekens, for his part, had a good-natured "Pride".
"The Pride of a Galamatch."
"Pride" also to confirm - in his capacity as"neighbors" - that France "has again become a team at a very high level", and that is just over a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job,” he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French National Elf) ... and that is towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
“We’re planning something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You'll notice that in the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward to the return against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
In the first round, both teams were lacking.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to save an opponent, and that is Bosnia.
Given the first game (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to impress on the matter the important stamp that would have taken the pressure away from it.
“That’s a good result, but there’s a certain risk to it as we haven’t scored a goal.”
At home, however, in their brightly radiant Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of an audience that is likely to be equally hot at the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very scarce", said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are completely convinced that we will be able to win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance to be there at the 2012 European Championships,” Carlos Queiroz’s successor said.
Friday’s draw in Bosnia forced the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk to it as we have not scored a goal," Bento said.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese intended to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning in order to "give them no time to reflect."
A good idea, provided it is put into practice this time.
