The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS at the Prague Council and in the city representatives at all.
The newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has a little "knocked off" members of the new Council of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD as they master the notorious slang, which has become naturalized in recent years when the current coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The codified vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the late era of Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the best-known actors, situations and Causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are somewhat in the dark in relation to these new terms.
At least that's what they say.
“Who is Voldemort?”
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, responded to the test of the "paten-word treasure".
But also Councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "golf hole".
"That's the only expression of those you present to me here that I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of slang."
From the vocabulary published by the Tagesblatt Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June before this year’s ODS Election Congress, the editorial board picked out six terms, especially those notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "bull nudes", "treason of the capital" and "bleaching".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague's school system - promised to participate in the conversation first, but did not even take the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
“I don’t care about these things, and how the Democrats talk to each other, I don’t judge.”
“It is important to me how we understand each other as part of our programs,” he said.
As already indicated, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kaucký allegedly did not recognize in the above-mentioned headline that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek, was mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he correctly guessed during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, but added to the security: "But I know this more from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'll have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plachý as the tunnel Blanka.
Both Social Democrats, however, also know who Voldemort stands for, and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plachý even knows where this figure can be found and what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
In agreement with B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, however, he claims to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be a similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is really no such thing with us."
"We call each other by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hulinský - by his party comrades salopp called "Hulda".
"In school I was called B<0xC5><0x99>íza, but I don't know if my colleagues also call me that," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has tried the name and look there - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party comrades of the "grandpa" or less friendly to the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who made himself aware by machinations in the party sponsorship before the elections, is called by some colleagues "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only ones that the Social Democrats allow in internal party language usage.
Hulínský allegedly dislikes being called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Stick Rights" allegedly has to do with Petr Hulínský acquiring his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and published a brochure
Women who are stamped as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more of the older generation, they do not find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared this, as they help work and give birth to children," a religious sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a specialised home for more than one hundred women who have been expelled by their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he issued a pamphlet that was meant to stop the "witch persecution".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "der Standard" warned of the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But being accused of witchcraft is also commonplace in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured her with petroleum and simply lit her.
This incident was also reported by the BBC server.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter was merely a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointings.
After the group tried to “drive out an evil spirit” from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" support people here without regard to their education.
A 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso quoted “The Standard” as saying: “Fooding human souls is a danger earlier than today,” he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambian president himself did a decent mix last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh sparked a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt died, as they allegedly took part in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called for help to shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, abducted indiscriminately detained women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the imprisoned people were forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused bowel and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive their stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that the nearly 1,000 prisoners were released.
A Bakala tenant: He is heating in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly hired man is just leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "charcoal baron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm a wallet with three new rental contracts for three apartments: for his own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three were just raised in terms of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kronor monthly rent, the son is expected to surpass 4100 kronor next year for a two-bedroom apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there isn't even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal stove," he touches angry with his finger on the son's new lease, for which he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-distorted and half-resigned.
The civil society association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it plans to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just waves off.
"One says this, the other says this," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay market-friendly rent.
Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and has been busy as early as nine in the morning this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and with it a call device.
"Rent 2011", that is how a special touchscreen panel lights up.
Shortly typed and the device already spits out a number slip.
We have barely deciphered the number "157" and already beeps it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later it is your turn.
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not even apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, the envelopes in the Ostrava region with the new leases will be in the mailboxes for most of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty suggests in the letters a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for the new rentals in the client center has been open since November 18.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, this is just the beginning," the ladies behind the switch reply after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala’s former mining dwellings are a breaking topic.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, from Ostrava, took up this topic quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
“Twenty years I want them to have a new floor.”
"They couldn't even change their toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning of the book said.
So far, according to the employees, retirees are mainly at the counter to make sure they really get the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who sign the new rental agreement by December 15, will also benefit from a half-reduced rent in February.
Until now, however, "deregulation switch" in Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov is anything but overloaded with demands.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, there were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of this," the counter officers estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites as well as on wall panels where it seems necessary.
However, if the renting parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not meant to be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG said on its website.
"No one goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially gives her right.
"I have 13,000 (crown) pensions, 5,000 of which I have left for food, where should I get the money for a court case," he says.
The employee will be insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so the people are still waiting," she said.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic at New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the upset tenants is according to the homeowners the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest $4 billion in housing in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be $5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting room of Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov, a few red shining information appears again and again.
"Rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31,200 homes, that is, more than 90% of RPG homes."
“This always means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month,” reads the LCD monitor.
Only for 400 homes in RPG’s portfolio, rent increases by 38 percent.
“In these cases, it’s about an extremely low price increase of 19.66 CZK per square meter,” RPG argues.
At 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not push rents up steadily, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposes another obligation: all revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - these are primarily intended to benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything it includes: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
Arch.Design, the design and architecture firm, from whose studios a number of well-known Brno buildings originated, counted from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building on the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
With wise foresight, because most of its 90 employees (inside) are in the baby boom age and the company is keen to have the project designers return to their jobs as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for civil engineers and architects to bring their demanding profession and childcare under one roof.
The Mini-Kindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design’s employees (inside) and with the support of the management, they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from funds of the European Social Fund and from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies of CZK 2.8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment were procured and qualified personnel and operations were provided for a period of 2 years.
After the funding has been exhausted (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini-kindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company providing active assistance in the processing of applications.
The children take care of full-time qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can attend children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but the day alternates between several children.
The kindergarten business is flexibly tailored to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
The children are not only playing here, above all they are offered excellent instruction - from basic knowledge to preschool lessons, besides they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time, thus eliminating the stress of late picking up the children from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships also develop here.
Arch.Design thus ranked among the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programs reinforce their personnel marketing.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof sounds like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic shapes got the nickname "bone house".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile shards and mosaics, the scale-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
It is only on closer inspection that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the entire fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination enhances the glow of the colors even more.
The same buoyant lines and convoluted shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even gaze holes and strips.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the renovation of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to Gaudí’s idea of an unusual and also cheaper renovation.
The Casa Batlló rental house, however, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner were created and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other artists and artists also worked on the design of the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí’s Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given the nickname "bone house" by the local inhabitants of its organic shapes.
Others, on the other hand, called it the "thinning house" because of the special window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system unique for the time, with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces.
Something weird already mutates her 45-degree slope.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be distracted by them.
Before the construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so appalled by the result that they demanded remedy.
Among other things, the councillors also stumbled upon the fact that the construction with its pillars even interfered with the public sidewalk.
There was no change, however, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the district's request in this regard, Josep Batlló filed an application for the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was granted to him promptly.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a company lounge, on the 3rd floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were eliminated and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the interconnection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could conveniently chat without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, the house received a rather unusual roof and two other floors due to Gaudí's renovation.
Also impressive is Gaudí’s play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is clothed and the lighthouses.
The play of these two colors gives the highest level of light to all floors of the house.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited today by anyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year, on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were maintained, yes, they were also extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a Papenstiel, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist IDs receive a 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rack? Women have different desires than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying area - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must harmoniously complement each other in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In the selection, many things play a role - the weight, the height, the state of health and last but not least the sex of the sleeper.
Just as important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to subordinate themselves.
Typical example?
In a weekend home that is not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited as they take much longer to "warm up".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
In fact, if they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and are also on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not excluded that mold forms beneath them.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
“All the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can no longer sleep properly here.”
"For their sagging shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I also recommend this to people suffering from a disorder of the nervous system, among other things, so that they can receive the 'information' from the joints and the skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why I bought many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with visco foam (memory foam).
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of visco foam.
This “miracle” actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it clinges directly to the warm body.
Nowhere does it squeeze, at night you don’t roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add to the height the length of the soles of the feet, that is, about 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women, who are 180 cm tall, need a bed of 210 to 220 cm long.
Each of the sleepers should be at least 90 cm wide, together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example single beds, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For convenience and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are lying on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master of upholstery and room furnishers, who has been devoting herself for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, there is no choice but to mount the grate at different heights and this is far from possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with a spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should fall on the mold layer and the fine padding.
"You can't feel the feathers with your hand or when you sit down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and base like mattressed twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will slowly turn into a huge (and clogged) screen.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years for mattresses, even a lifetime warranty.
Every thing has its if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, do not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, detachable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Although today mattress covers are usually made with a round zipper, so that after opening you get two halves (important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially executed alone, often implies the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if none are already in it) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable lattice slats with 14 to 18 spring slats (lamellae), with a greater number of lattice slats, i.e. 28 and more spring slats, with lordosis support in the lumbar area and the possibility of regulating the lattice hardness.
Adjustable slatted grids do not include mattresses with a spring skeleton, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring strips, which makes it possible to press the spring strips or even to angle them in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink at a point.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area on "master mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are designed.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow for the right mattress and the right rust, most of the benefits will be lost.
Here again a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears, as the Scandinavians like, for example.
In the side position, the cushion should balance the height of the shoulder (together with the shoulder relief zone in the grate or the soft zone in the mattress).
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former straw sacks (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Also in mattresses, the new magic word is "organic".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils - for example castor and soybean oils - are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams.
Soy is probably used by all well-known manufacturers.
"Bio means that mattresses are made of purely natural materials," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent while sleeping.
Here, too, there is a difference between man and woman.
While men use a "cooler" plant extract from birch leaves so that the mattress cover can absorb heat and cool the body, the covers for women have a "warming" effect.
Extracts from red bell peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex warms up comfortably when sleeping.
What about today’s favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercially available polyurethane and also much more flexible).
By combining the various stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where the head, hip and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to cover.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT because they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You can see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
Occasionally there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with visco foam memory quilted in the reference for 11,990 CZK.
The second one is given for free.
It was the Tempur material that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the launches.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in cool environment it in turn solidifies.
In this way, it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitoring equipment to keep the kids under control
Fear of their own children is growing and more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, originally invented to search for cars, can locate people just as well, which would be helpful in such cases as the recently traceless disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it should not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have been terrified by the disappeared Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of impairing their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not a question of spying around the world, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases such devices can be misused, for example, if you put them in someone's pocket without them knowing about it, but we haven't had such a case so far."
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková points out that if a child doesn’t like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they don’t want to be controlled.”
"At first, the mobile phones had high expectations for parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
“In the case of planned abductions, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics that could be used to locate them.”
“It’s the cell phone today.”
"If such monitoring devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising."
“In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted to report the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it is destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available."
"For more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, which means that if you fall and remain motionless, the device immediately sends out a warning indicating the position," says Mr. <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform smart mobile phones with navigation, you only need to play a special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are either matchbox-sized devices resembling pendants or smaller mobile phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin von der Macro Weil, therefore, devices that look like normal digital clocks are being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or locating device.
"Or he only notices this after a certain period of time, which gives the police a lead in time," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development is going - towards bracelets or pendants, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So to the combination of location function using the GPS system (just like with the navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap the whole of the Czech Republic but it only lasts two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition cords to be fired with explosives.
The previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have spent 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the joint-stock company STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
In his reasoning for purchasing this enormous amount of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of ignition cord annually.
According to research by army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, it emerges from this statement that the entire army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be halfway justified.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would be enough for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that for training each new professional soldier two meters of ignition cord is completely sufficient, then the army has created a calming supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the Rapid Operations Brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises are severely restricted due to the lack of means.
Not to mention the lack of pants.
"I also don't know why they buy so many ignition cords from us."
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a distributor want to meet as much as possible," says the sales manager of STV Group Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>cký.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition cord by saying that the army would have covered up with this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>cký of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnics of only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused as a soldier of criticism of the army.
After the end of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not in vain, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometer ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told us the position of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defense.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of ignition cords by police pyrotechnics who liquidate ammunition from World War II or the Soviet Brother Army has for several years barely exceeded 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of the service life.
Due to the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of more flexible purchases is also kept open, which means more modern and therefore more reliable ignition cords.
The Ministry of Defense is already having huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the period of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak people’s army was preparing for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, who spoke to MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect in a few years the same problem in liquidating hundreds of kilometers old ignition cords that they bought so "cheaply" today.
To this day, the contacts that I gained thanks to the competition come to me
The winning placement in the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec was the winner of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition last year.
The story of his success sounds like a film scenario.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that Liberec lacks good accommodation options at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and by means of a bank loan, he obtained a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was then a university student in the sixth semester, this was surely a brave undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time angered me and so I tried to do something about it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented out to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profit back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has managed to open four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another top-notch hotel was added.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun hotels franchise have already signed up," says the entrepreneur number one last year.
"Great share of this license sale to operate hotels had just the victory in the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition, Mr Pytloun adds acknowledgingly.
The victory has earned him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me even afterwards and I have to say it did really well,” he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to make a difference to participate in this competition.
You don’t have to win right away, every visualization is good.
He says that he still benefits from contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have happened at all.
“With some people I’ve met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships to this day.”
In his opinion, the fame associated with success also strikes a little on each of his employees.
And there he has to the seventy.
“I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is generally acknowledged.”
I really do not see this as just personal success, no, it is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name has only come to the fore," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
Victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst behind it.
The prize for the first place of the competition Vodafone company of the year last year received Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>árský, the company owner of Farmet.
The jury at the time commended the efforts with which he stepped out of the small tool building in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice a company that makes hundreds of millions of turnovers.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged me but all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history was an effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>árský a small workshop to rent as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, abandoned his career in the company where he was employed until then, and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few comrades of his father.
Shortly afterwards, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have grown to become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the aforementioned competition and its mediation that it also became aware of the non-professional public.
"Not only do our customers see the Farmet brand much more intensely, our foreign partners have also begun to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country to place greater value," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>árský.
However, last year at Farmet was not only a sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at the time shook even less the citizens, but above all the companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course we couldn't avoid this situation either."
"Resumptions fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>árský.
A viable company sometimes also has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black numbers, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
For one, the company was not willing to make any cuts - in investments in research and development.
"From this grant, we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won major awards at domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>árský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Revenues are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in winning - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>árský says.
An opinion poll that clears up with nonsensical regulations
The opinion poll on the "Absurdity of the Year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already managed to get out of the world.
The dubious winner of next year's poll "Absurdity of the Year" has become the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
Thus, more than a third of not all four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the Social Security Administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing now.
"In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register when checking social security payers," said <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová.
The purpose of the "Absurdity of the Year" opinion poll is to examine all the regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and remove the nonsensical ones.
For the fourth time this year, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the German Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and enjoys a growing popularity among the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, this year there were already four thousand.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to hinder business activity.
"With regard to the number of income tax forms, for example, we are taking a leading position in the world," notes Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the association of small and medium-sized businesses and traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of company conditions, down by eight places compared to the previous year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first declared in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September.
For registration, the web address is www.firmaroku.cz. The organiser of the competition then selects seven candidates for the "Anti-Price" and allows the public to vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It overcomes the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and orders have already been registered for this year’s opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, there are also provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay toll for motorways and highways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to prepare every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square is part of an event in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and trader of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the culmination of the competition with from the party.
“Where the state throws a stick between the entrepreneurs’ legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so my goal is to remove at least thirty paragraphs each year, which today make their undertakings unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create nonsensical orders from the world are proving effective.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the entrepreneurs’ obligation to have to notify the commercial official at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance of the intention to travel with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or church.
This obligation was abolished by virtue of an amendment of the Trade Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report service trips of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
All good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation was chosen that required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales in the office.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation dropped.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair undertakings.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the impact their business has on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of Vodafon, the proclaimer and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebel of the Year" competition.
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and contains enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject matter of their activities, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is, for example, about people with disabilities, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory in Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady also takes good care of its health-disabled employees, which make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was honored with the title "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region"; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which, among other things, introduced a flowing and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week and did so without a proportionate reduction in wages.
At the award ceremony, the jury also honoured the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizen initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimise the environmental impact of our business activities and administration," explains its Managing Director Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem region, in turn, is committed to the health of its employees and has therefore acquired them ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, as well as promoting their employees' work at home and for corporate actions, it uses cartering services provided by a locally protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Need", which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>ní" from the Karlsbad region is also worth mentioning, which contributes to their pension insurance for its employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with contributions to food, work, qualifications and holidays," says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D> of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Schlesian region.
For the category Responsible company of the year, all district finalists of the competition Vodafon company of the year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed to the registration and sent it to the organizer no later than 15 August.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the "Responsible Company of the Year" competition, but in the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition they were not disqualified for that reason.
“Separate registration for this competition only is not possible because it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year,” said Karel Goldman of the hosting agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of the police during a public tender
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police carried out arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was handcuffed by the detectives.
The latter had allegedly attempted to manipulate a public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the plots offered in the competition belonged to a specific interested party.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. is said to have paid half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the crime of fraudulent machinations in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo", she could not provide further details in view of the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was fired by the police.
How he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated given the sparse official information.
The spokeswoman for the Lubomír <0xC4><0x8C>erná Land Fund referred to Právo’s question in this regard that the police had actually carried out arrests in the Pilsner subdivision of the Land Fund during a public competition.
“It was about a client and not one of our employees,” she said.
According to Ms. <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public competition had the correct designation "Call for tender of claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of land within the scope of the solicitation."
"According to the offered claims, the order of the potential acquirer is determined, then the land fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokeswoman of the fund.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had information available on who had applied at the request and since he himself was a legitimate person, having purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered a land interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
For example, he also played a role in the case of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for publishing plots in substitutions that had already been made location decisions on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. from the Soil Fund also acquired land destined for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access magistrale to the commercial area Borské pole was planned.
Later, he exchanged this very favorably with the magistrate for a house directly in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At the time, the town hall had to add heavy hearts in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the land.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred per month
Households must not only expect higher costs for all types of energy from January, but also higher water and wastewater fees and for district heating and some places also increase rents.
As of January, families will have to draw several hundred crowns more monthly from the wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6% more expensive, gas by 2% and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places district heating supplies will also be more expensive.
Electricity alone costs the housing households a few hundred more kroner per year.
The high-power prices were lowered by all major suppliers, so the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic plants, is to blame.
Although gas is only moderately expensive, it is precisely when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here again, we can expect a few hundred more kroner per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, district heating prices vary from city to city.
Especially larger towns are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay up to 50 crowns per month for district heating from January onwards, and more than 1000 crowns more per year for families in Liberec.
In turn, the residents of Prague are threatened with 9% higher water and sewage charges in the event that the city increases infrastructure leases.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8%.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental homes, where the so-called rental regulation will be eliminated from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2,500 homes in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January.
Anyone who disagrees with this rent increase will be prosecuted by the company.
Regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 homes today, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally also a good whiskey that was stolen from the father's bar.
These are the drinks that drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen most often need to be treated for.
No exception is children who have to fall asleep repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experiences of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine is completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán, the head doctor of the children's department at the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Clinic in the Middle Bohemian Region.
"Whisky, if it succeeds in stealing a bottle from the father's house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The spokeswoman of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová is right.
"It's most often about Fernet or Rum."
“That’s the current alcohol trend, especially in primary schools.”
"It was also about Slibowitz, which you take away from home," Ms. Jurinová said.
According to Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no longer an exception in hospital admission.
Before the clinic in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
“She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first admitted with 3.5 permiles of alcohol in the blood and in combination with ecstasy,” the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was at some dance party at the exhibition grounds in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," he said.
Especially the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in pushing with their own sprouts is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence in children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who drink alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains Pelikán, chief physician.
According to the spokeswoman of Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, by mid-November, about forty drunken children were admitted to the local department of paediatric and juvenile medicine.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunken children who are brought home by their parents or, if necessary, by the police after outpatient treatment will not be registered.
In addition to cases where children only drunk a bottle of liquor in the school bench, Mr. Pelikán believes there are three seasonal amplitudes that are 100% reliant: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of grief for the bad testimony or out of joy at the holidays."
"On Walpurgisnacht I have seen seven drunken children at once in the recording," stresses Dr. Pelikán.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who struggles with only an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The morning after headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency can be eliminated in hospital with a fluid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients lacking in the body.
"They are clearly better off, because after the 'glorious' experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without hurting anything anywhere."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, sometimes spoiling the patient's good mood by telling them the cost of the treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly for a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"In and out I used this as an educational tool when I directly predicted to the children during the visit what their drunkenness cost and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such party," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures to demand the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from the parents.
Two L-159 training aircraft in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two L-159 light fighter jets of a total of five that the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft have flown to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have been in the possession of a foreign army.
They were previously only seen abroad on maneuvers or flight shows.
This is the L-159T1 two-seater version, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The other three aircraft are single-seater L-159s.
These are currently still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known when she physically dispatches the planes from Vodochody.
The L-159 single-seat fighter jets were separated from long-term stored aircraft without any additional deposits and investments from the department.
"The double-seater L-159T1 was replaced in its current condition and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seater fighter jets, as the Department of Defense signed a 200-million-dollar contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to rebuild four superfluous L-159s to the two-seater version.
A new aircraft took over the army in July and the second plane will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has committed to enforcing the fighter jets into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is a customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to be used to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer how he realizes the matter," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence did not call for tenders for procurement, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159s abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only used 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa planes should also have a judicial repercussion.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice, because it had to select the aircraft on the basis of a whole-European tender and not on the basis of a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last one expected to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index fingers are longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Ms. Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain tracked more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men had the same likelihood of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose index fingers were longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which form as early as prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is the one that accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows the study is volatile, yet he does not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly stuck snow, the winter servicemen were on axle all night long in many places.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked because of some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
That said Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Club (UAMK).
At kilometer 91, a truck crashed, at kilometer 93, two trucks collided, in this accident there were injured.
A few cars are also in the road.
There are also problems at kilometer 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Here too, two trucks collided.
The drivers should leave just behind Brno at kilometer 190 or drive over Brno and start at kilometer 182 at the town of Kývalka.
This is where miles of traffic jams form.
There was also an accident on the D11 on the road to Prague.
In Prague itself is a snow cover several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car colonies form, for example, in the city rush Prosek, also the street <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railway and the airfield.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven high-speed train connections due to snowfall.
For example, there are problems on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be aware of the current situation.
Airport Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> is closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Three side roads around Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov are completely immobile, in the vicinity of Brno there is snowfall and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Vý<0xC5><0xA1>kov.
There are still three roads completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Here too, snow milling will have to be used to clear snow.
When they will be driven again, it is not possible to estimate so far.
Caution should be exercised in the Hodonín region in the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are only allowed to be scattered with inert scattering agents for reasons of nature, there is a snow cover of up to five centimeters thick, <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimetres of new snow fell, most of it in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Schlesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new “intelligent weapon”.
The U.S. forces have for the first time deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under its code designation XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise cannon.
Your projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a strike safety of only a few meters.
The special bullets of caliber 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode at any point in their ballistic trajectory, not only when impacting the target.
That is, you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technologies.
The soldier is basically doing this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains a precise point of sight, after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he only needs to depress.
"Let's say, they measured 543 meters."
"When you press down, the gun charges up and shoots the bullet down to the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being relocated
Fujitsu Group moves its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their jobs from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu moves its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialized in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu said that in the medium term there should be another 100 jobs of the group, which so far have been distributed throughout the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large offices in the Astro Park would be better suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu had only been tenants.
Responsible Managing Director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is especially important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The relocation of an important company within the region yesterday sparked joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
The Frankfurt economic deputy Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" had been won again.
This is a “great site commitment.”
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, there were economic reasons for the outbreak.
Now it is about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
The house at the Town Hall Square and the adjacent "Little Vertical" used by Fujitsu so far were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town with the remaining buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both for the massive construction of the previously partly used parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still affiliated with Siemens, acquired the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based German Real Estate Opportunity Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu, based in Tokyo, calls itself the third-largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The office in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves to Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name refers to its star-shaped layout - the central association of electrical engineering and electronics industry is based, among other things.
Amazon blocks servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps political pressure is behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic essays.
Wikileaks founder Assange allegedly resides in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
However, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s search lists, is said to be in Britain, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks Replaced by Amazon Servers."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the revelation activists said via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, Amazon banned WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in publishing the secret diplomatic debacles in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: “Prima – our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its servers by WikiLeaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's staff investigated, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the Guardian reported.
“I wish Amazon had taken this action earlier in light of WikiLeaks’ previous releases of classified information,” he said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be denied the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, horrendous and ruthless action jeopardizes our national security and endangers lives around the globe," he said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is being searched for suspected rape by authorities in Sweden, is on Interpol’s search list.
According to the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, the exact location is Scotland Yard known.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is rightly afraid of his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will remain in hiding.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations be indicted and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper — obviously ironically — said on television that Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange, there was an exchange of blows.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently made known espionage requests to diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its own website.”
The U.S. government is now thoroughly testing the protection of its databases.
The Deputy Director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Action, Russell Travers, has been appointed as the Special Representative, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that have become necessary after Wikileaks’ disclosure of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to see how the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be endangered by the WikiLeaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if it becomes necessary.”
The Ice University
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are being prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the gelatine and the gelataio.
The ice cream maker, in German a bit old-fashioned ice cream maker, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream making art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream from the refrigerator counter with a spatula, strips it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you will not pass the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The University of Ice set up the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream shop.
Some in the midlife crisis dream of a new career, others just dare to the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years in a nerve-wracking job wants to pay something of her own.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatinist Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also the silky smoothness and good consistency.
In his training, Luciano also does not forget the cream of the national and even southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance in it."
The first step to manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a tap on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk ice creams.
Immediately the lecturer is confronted with questions: Can ice cream only be made with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you let your own desire for experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guarmeal from the guarbee.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, but then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it sacks together and the customer bites on ice grains.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavours.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you dozens of flavored additives."
“But you should just experiment.”
Either fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano produces four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut ice cream – with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
The fruit ice creams are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn’t necessarily taste more nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream makes the working group that uses more fruit, less water, and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture really highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice making is a calculating task: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano produces a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wine growers measure the Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make calculating easier.
Making ice does not require as much physical activity as before.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the base mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice cream mixture is beaten creamy at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small breakdowns do not survive.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his classmates are peeling fruit puree from top to bottom when the oversized stick mixer gets out of control.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it is only a matter of time before such a thing happens.”
Inspectors in the dark
The European Food Authority Efsa is undermined by the industry experimenting with genetically engineered plants.
The expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology, is now making this accusation.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Christoph Then, chief test biotech officer, said Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
This is paid for by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has worked decisively on the Efsa testing regulations for genetically engineered plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The Efsa rules are paragraphs in line with position papers of the Ilsi, thus trumping the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech complains of a collision of interest.
For example, a high-level Efsa manager has recently been without conditions or transition period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and has thus changed sides.
The Central German Broadcasting Agency (MDR) also recently revealed personnel connections between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians loud.
However, Efsa cannot detect any conflict of interest.
All serious data, including industry data, can be used as long as they are of high technical quality, a statement said.
The experts who work for Efsa are not required to have no contacts with the industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper awarded his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics – including for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently approved without any feeding test in animals and the response of genetically modified plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
"We want to know what makes genetically modified corn on the field, for example," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how do you find them?" then asked accusing.
Angelika Hilbeck sees that as well.
She has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Zurich University of Technology.
Industry in this area, as in the US, is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would usually not be published.
“Industry controls security research,” Hilbeck claims.
The track of the stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about which, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It's snowy.
The story is well known: In September, the excavators had pulled in and had begun to break off a large part of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar laying down of the station.
When the construction stopped, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't leave."
He says, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he sawed one, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the scraps yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen at a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought everyone who came to the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were to be ground into gravel or disappeared in the landfill,” he says in his office, a wooden cottage that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when it was in the newspapers in September, that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it happens, then it would be the most sensible if the stones were to be used again.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the squares weighing on average 80 kilograms, price per unit 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest is sold long ago.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, homestead builders.
They had come from everywhere and dragged away what could carry the trunk and trailer.
The Stuttgart stones of stumbling blocks have long since turned into "mauerle" or boundaries of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
“It wouldn’t be the political component.”
He gets into his off-road car, taking a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and quit, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
He stores 40,000 tons of stones.
He gathers his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the Republic's biggest stone dealer.
He's braking.
In the snow are artfully carved sandstones.
“They once belonged to Dresden’s Marienbrücke,” he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the road through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The squares once belonged to the stand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were once carved by hand and moved with simple bottlenuts and ox carts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
"It would be a scandal if you were to shred something like that."
He has not become rich, not at all stone rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, and there have been stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener settling in the woods.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the residual valuer.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save, too.
Talent struggle for high-potentials
There's plenty of room at the buffet.
16 students rush for salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they should simplify the subject of the car of the future together with VW developers - and get to know Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now entering the melee and rely, like VW, on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates to the auditoriums as early as possible before they enter the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish lists of the achievements of their students, one tries to spy on the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to oneself.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company is promoting the talents.
A young lady from the HR department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can also get to know students, look closer to interesting candidates and think about who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperations, Selle says, are not unusual.
It’s important to be offended by the students.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to select their employees from a large number of applicants.
Instead, they have to praise themselves and, in particular, for high-skilled workers.
Above all, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering jobs remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta is on a talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt where participants must find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students plan to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, participants can check out KPMG stores and get to know the company.
Whoever is allowed to participate will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When shooting and punching around the high potentials at the universities, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta, the bill seems to go up.
“To this day, we have been in contact with all participants of a similar action last year.”
“Some are close to graduation and want to apply with us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct bubbling on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also go on the pirsch at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
“About at Intersolar,” reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the offspring problem.
Currently, 35 jobs are advertised on the company's website.
"It's very difficult to fill vacant positions right now."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not recommended by the solar specialist.
For this purpose, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
“This is often not what a large company can offer,” says HR Manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other decisive factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual ranking list of German employers.
To do this, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Stübe also hopes that the placement will give the job seekers advantages.
“I think applicants are especially looking for external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He encourages his clients to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In industry jargon, internal employer branding means employer branding within your own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, then they would advertise to friends and acquaintances for their employer on their own.
"It's like a game with gangs," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been enacted by the government in Washington - and thus definitively revoked its previous plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is banned for the time being.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Prior to the disaster that killed eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The proponents want to reduce the dependence of the United States on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not been finally clarified to this day.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which faces billions of claims.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is expected to present its findings in the course of December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe.
Currently, the competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous corruption allegations, is undergoing a fundamental reform.
In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the production volume in the Gulf would be considerably lower than before through stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," the results of a recent industry survey by consulting firm BDO - even before Wednesday's ban on drilling.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows what exactly will change with regulation.”
Investment in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of leaked crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigeria’s Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari is good.
“Don’t stand down,” the eco-activist calms down the journalists: “You’ll still get enough oil mud in front of the lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to expose a boy wading up to his chest in the water with the strings surrounding him: in the rainbow-colored water glow, the scene looks almost pretty.
That under the surface brown crude oil swaths float is not visible.
Previously, she collected shrimp here, Esther Badom tells us on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the sluggish flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil poured into the huge wetland from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: the Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the way through the mangrove swamps crossed by rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of light water, the motorboat rolls up brown broth, whoever dips his hand into the water pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude like black licorice bars from the ground, sadly letting palm trees hang their wedges.
Swarms of birds, as are usual in wetlands, are searched in vain: as soon as the outboard is silent, spooky tranquillity spreads out in the former paradise smelling like a gas station.
"What's happening here is ecological warfare," Celestine Akpobari says: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement is a battlefield that has been fought for decades: here more than 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe invaded, here in the 1980s organized the first resistance with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is denied a return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of the triple size of Switzerland with over 5,000 drilling sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland have broken, the situation is too unstable for the Group.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames protrude like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the holes far too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drilling head breaks apart, Akpobari thinks, then a constant stream of crude oil ran into the water.
More than two billion liters have flowed into the Delta’s ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that entered the sea off Alaska in the disaster of the supertanker “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago – one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU is disputed.
While Shell’s sabotage and organized oil theft account for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main contributors.
Shell has lower security standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008: the rate of faults at the lines alone is "many times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop in the open air, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are splitter-naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected to tubes, partly scattered arbitrarily on the site, a fire is flashing: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later drops out at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-litre barrels of diesel a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of diesel at just under 40 euro cents per liter can still be lowered by the illegal cookers: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from “bunkers” who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: according to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a tiny part of the provisionally interim stockpiled commodity is illegally refined: organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion’s share of the stockpile in tankers and transport it to the world market.
The debate over whether the environmental catastrophe is due more to the movements of the population or the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers purely academic.
“If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if they had not destroyed fishermen’s livelihoods so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries.”
In the meantime, the Ogoni’s relationship with Shell has been so destroyed that only a withdrawal from the group would be in question: “Perhaps other nationalities such as the Chinese turn out to be better.”
Michael gets nervous.
"Most time for you to disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"The soldiers can come every minute."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they do not threaten to be arrested, but rather a painful lubrication.
Soldiers mainly from the northern part of the country, like all Nigerians, also want to benefit from the raw material.
“This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous construction defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major safety problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction defect during the investigation of an emergency landed machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency-landed Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November seem to have been much luckier than previously known: The Australian Aviation Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in its investigation of the engines of some A380 machines - and is now warning of a possible construction defect.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: with an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, according to a statement from the ATSB authority published on Thursday.
This could have led to “a catastrophic engine failure.”
Rolls-Royce-made engines in 20 A380 aircraft are affected.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing her to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the fire of the engine, parts had loosened and the wings were damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue was considered sufficiently important to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had held its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine on an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Countrywide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Overnight snow fell almost all over the country.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and flights fail.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: With icy temperatures, almost the entire Republic has snowed on Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are some 15 centimeters thick snow covers.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous operation, but was not able to cope with the constantly exciting snow.
In addition, heavy gusts swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime and Hydrography (BSH) expects from the morning on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal.
In Saxony, the snowfall on motorways and highways led to significant problems.
According to the weather central Meteomedia, the alarm level in Saxon Switzerland was therefore violet - the highest level ever.
Partly there fell 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds caused confusion.
There were several trucks and cars stuck at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the roads.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stagnant traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, collapsed trees on the rails, or destroyed cables and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be discontinued.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firefighters and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
At large German airports, snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the Flight Information Centre, some cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, nearly 400 field beds are still available for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had overrun her car at Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
However, meteorologists have good news: although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will swirl even in light gusts.
But the wind will slow down.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could be contributed to the property.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters beautiful: the twin towers in the banking district of Frankfurt have been modernized; meanwhile, bankers have been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate ourselves and then lease it back," he said.
Germany’s largest credit institution thus relinquishes its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had not taken over the double towers until mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and subsequently extensively refurbished them.
The energy conversion swallowed the data for around 200 million euros.
A sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers", according to the newspaper, at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, is still open at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn dead friends
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered because the security situation in the pit of disaster is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, a massive explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were dumped underground.
A probe had been dropped into the cavity, but had found no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescuers were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddy.
The bodies have not been recovered so far.
Now family and friends commemorated the dead with a memorial.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in the bright sunshine at Greymouth on New Zealand’s South Island.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honor of the poured miners, 29 tables were set up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the companions were to be seen.
Images and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags were waving on half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth", New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants in the commemoration.
“But they never came home.”
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was spilled in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial ceremony.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also spilled.
Rescue workers began to put out a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, it will start cooling down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn redevelops old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) liberates himself from his tormentors and nearly superhumanly surrounds his opponents in series - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods alive, and his enemies have already riddled the hustle and bustle.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, does not say a word about the whole film, and even the other characters can at most be ripped to a sentence or two or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, the scenery is silent and sweeping in the terrifyingly beautiful hills of Scotland, which the Viking world of about a thousand years ago offers.
Ideal for adult cinematographers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It’s nice if a film has multiple audiences, it’s only a shame if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but Stoic refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the splashing brain mass and intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, the eye with a force of violent Christian missionaries breaks out to Jerusalem via ship and gets stuck in a muddle and mist for an eternity before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
No wonder, therefore, that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a movie rental in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film isn’t about dialogue or a stringent plot, it’s all atmosphere, a feverish dream made into a film.
And there is no escape from it for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly draws his throat with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unbelievable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who stands faithfully by the side of one eye keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who for enemies and temporary allies at some point becomes a warrior from hell, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the already corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to bother, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA has revealed new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is refusing to take a stand - nor does it allow for controls.
At midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets are attacking a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates River; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the square with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that runs out of the electricity.
According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence agency CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technology from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
Using computer animation, she illuminated what components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos that show the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was close to commissioning, it was said, but not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more known than then, yes the mysteries became rather larger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was pretty sure that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, it saw little indication that there was “an active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an “alleged reactor”, even if they consider the CIA presentation to be “plausible.”
They lack hard evidence, as is the IAEA.
Asked how certain he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer answered only lapidarly that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The debris of the alleged "unused military building" the Syrians rushed aside and planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack via a Member State, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analysing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as has the satellite imagery.
In addition, it denies inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
Israel is also silent on iron.
“We will never comment on this,” said Ehud Olmert, Prime Minister at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been dragging on unsuccessfully since June 2008 and "increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a high Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the non-nuclear-weapons treaty, over which the IAEA watches.
The IAEA apparently sees as the key to progress in enlightenment three other facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and still exist differently from this one.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed what facilities they are, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and found on satellite images a building complex near Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base – precisely with this reason Syria denies the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the US to spy on military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has clues, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three locations and the square on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be “related to fuel production.”
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated from it, there are at best plausible guesses about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could hold valuable traces has been stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the debris has been.
The al-Tibni salt mine, just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria investigated in 1998 for its suitability as a storage facility for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely to be located by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
Shots from orbit, however, show that Syria undertook earthwork at the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that would allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only the effort shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also ironed off this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna had calmed down a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter does not have a high urgency, for example, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Viennese Atomic Energy Agency has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitating.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are far from eager to escalate.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says, "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much more about it – but that’s enough for unrest.
The rumor persisted that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, whereupon some shooting days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote to Jolie about the UN refugee agency UNHCR and asked for a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she once offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting should be held in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
There have been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, her organization has recommended that Jolie be fired as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, gave Sarajevo a shot permit after some time back and forth - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself claims that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
In terms of content, however, it remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film circulates on the web, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other already before the outbreak of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds much different than the variant "Victims of rape fall in love in torture serf".
That Jolie’s film actually starts before the war – so much is certain.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can make peace: by illegally putting the script on the web, as so many have done before.
Nothing like get away here
This evening, it’s finally going really well for the Irish.
No sign of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans jolted with joy with loud loud music, they stamped with their feet.
The Bailey pub in South Ireland’s Cork is shaking because players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups – and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there is 500 Euro victory prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the Beerpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist that doesn’t really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself by diverting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will hold job interviews in New Zealand in January.
“I have a wicked feeling,” he says.
"It's so far from home and I still have no work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had ruck, zuck her wish job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: As with the Tanners, it looks like on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts from the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they expect 200,000 emigrants.
This is a huge loss for the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now widening again.
The economic crisis in particular disturbs the young, well-educated Irish, for whom it has hitherto only been uphill.
Loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was abundant.
Three out of ten men and women under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times has a lot of letters from young immigrants who complain: “Everything in Ireland is going down the stream.”
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one, please turn off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future ahead because the government only wipes eyes and no longer offers young people prospects for the future.
“They’re reducing minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy for how to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
She watches her fellow students hang out from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
“This thought is sad and depressing.”
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to take the issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that provides a comprehensive service on the subject of working abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known about how it feels to build somewhere else for half a year.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are currently raising a fashion house.
In January we will continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan's home is now rarely seen, as he makes extra shifts to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, as he steps for the first time over the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again."
He laughs a bit embarrassed and walks through chilled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept gardens, in the entrances park big, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit.
“It was crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start all over again."
The civil engineer does not like the grief he hears often at the moment.
"Nobody has to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island," he says.
“Working abroad for a while isn’t the worst thing that can happen – maybe we’ll feel like an Irish man.”
He laughs and then tells of his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leaving the future open and just look at how life is going somewhere else.
He has a few years of work in London and why shouldn’t New Zealand be doing well for him and his girlfriend?
But there is one more thing that really worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could depart into a farewell party.
“Don’t break too many emotions,” he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
“Goodbye, that sounds scary.”
“Let’s call it a party, loosely, with a couple of friends, a few drinks, a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is growing stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results were included in the Latinobarometer survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly relevant in this year’s survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp collapse last year.
But only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region’s most populous countries, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country’s democratic practice, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust their country’s congress and 45% their government, both of which are similar to last year’s, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crisis undermined efforts for more democracy.
This continued during the global economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong mood differences from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thought of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the beginning of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see Figure 5).
Around 31% say either they themselves or a family member have been the victims of a crime in the past year, but compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economies: about 71% of respondents indicated that the private sector is indispensable for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the highest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the United States as the most influential country, with this role being taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A voting trap
No one expected that the elections in Haiti on November 28 would be perfect.
But the facts far surpassed the fears of the electoral aides who rushed to help the distressed country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, repeated votes, ballots in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were just part of the problems.
Election halls opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, wandered around in search of an option.
Some finally gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged leaders, demanded that election results be lifted due to an alleged fraud.
Partially violent protests took place throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election “pretty good in many respects.”
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, “these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily render the process invalid.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly obligated to the unpopular departing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no voter approval at all, declares the electoral authority to be the winner of the ballot, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, low voter turnout has been feared.
On Election Day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 IDs that are needed for the election were not yet issued.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, the highest since her election in 2007.
However, whether they will help re-election next year depends on whether the apparently grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who steered economic policy even after his wife’s election, often set out budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenues at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further disruption.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian punched another in the face and others accused the government of bribery) Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to discuss it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by as much as 9% this year.
The official inflation rate currently stands at 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands from trade unions - drive the figure to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction one of his main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then beautified official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate path now?
It has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to hold talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are expected to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentine agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
Inflation, however, undermined the growth boost due to a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous re-indebtedness in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors of the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like this is the first step towards cleansing the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her term without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which for the most part has enough of church-churchism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been brought to them will be subdued.
If she wants to win another election, she must decide whether to silently overturn many of her husband’s political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly getting closer to the mainland.
What do you think of Taiwan’s big brother on the other side of the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of all eligible voters, set up to vote as mayors and councillors in the five districts. This is considered a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only short.
Although its Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocated greater independence for Taiwan, received nearly 50% of the votes, while the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election there were the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-swinging mass movements and sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing at the forefront.
But this time the DPP also avoided too much to stir up anti-Chinese feelings.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese supports his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back into the community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It will wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has since reinvented itself.
Two years ago it was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in jail for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
However, under Tai’s rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fights for the voices of working people and youth.
Tsai, as the DPP’s presidential candidate, received great approval, as did Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that it too is able to build close ties with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea forging as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this presupposes non-judgmental discussions.
Tsai publicly declared that her party is offering a “trustworthy alternative” to Ma’s swift approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he explained that the DPP candidates had done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged the pragmaticist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s interference, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
But values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without him.
The main reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reshape his cabinet as well as local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only limitedly in favour of reconciliation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no longer a return.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony, and now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrity in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at most three albums prior to the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Their ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" is certainly a step forward. And with her vibrant voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, you can easily compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination Spalding.
In addition, the Vijay Iyer Trio's album "Historicity" was nominated in the category Instrumental Albums.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robber favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, which would otherwise be more likely to feature albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the large group category, he thus competes against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose Life Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonicists and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium of the Art"
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "BBC"
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic on January 4 under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute track is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category instrumental solo with orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestral Performance for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula, after a five-hour, often heated public hearing, reached the unanimous agreement of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center will be in line with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is being supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
“As an American, that makes me proud.”
“It shows that justice reigns.”
“There are only a few opponents,” he added.
"They're just very noisy."
"Wonderful people live in this valley."
The session began at 18:00 and discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed, according to Press Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” he said.
“It’s another planet of the monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand.”
“America is at the end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the city of New York on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for nonviolence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filter manufacturer.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 Mediterranean-style mosque will have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It will be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still lodge an objection with the city council against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible without the elements previously considered necessary for life.
"This organism has two options."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
“That makes it very special, even though it’s almost some kind of ‘foreign’ life form,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online issue of Science magazine on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California’s Mono Lake continues to grow even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“You wonder what else is possible,” said co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were announced gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery “shows that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements, and that the ‘standard elements’, which we believe are absolutely essential, are not necessarily fixed,” said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
“This work is novel, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures, one element can be replaced by another,” Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of the high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to its chemically similar behavior to phosphorus."
“This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another.”
"But the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus, it enters our biochemical system where it smears almost everything," Anbar explains.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration, which adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can survive in arsenic, but it shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has not been a working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
“This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth age,” said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Remaining stolen show dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to official statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are well," Whitmore said.
"You're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide any precise information on the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
“The investigation is still ongoing.”
“We don’t want to say more about it,” Whitmore explains.
“We are following some traces.”
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They welcomed their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch - were unharmed, according to authorities statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the nearly one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their vans in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier, and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The fat Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised anyone who could give a hint of the Corgis a finder's wage. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether a Finder salary would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the “preparing” plan to pay off the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to make new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that nothing stands in the way of the restart of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself raises $75 million, is running the company, and funding is expected to run until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the commission to investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company, which was struggling with interest payments of $300 million/year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to resolve the financial worries of MGMs and pay off the studio’s more than 140 bulldozers took longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to buy the company at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it all began from scratch, when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by creditors in late October after months of debate and internal disputes.
If MGM has officially survived bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, will receive a $4 million “success bonus.”
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio released only one film and created an annual schedule of seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial contribution to these two films, which are to be produced under the direction of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite of gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can tear a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us, and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s law had come into effect, and this year’s technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year’s.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider offer on the most well-known of its kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button cell-powered toys are coming to the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are for Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children from 3 years old) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs, who sing a note when you press on their belly.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can’t stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interchangeable games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device used Mickey as a dance teacher, but her parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaire cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a better wiseman with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included in it are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which, after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series, is equipped with a new, brighter screen
Neither version is compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children over 8). The five blocks are no larger than a match box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about combining the blocks into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have an online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child a Club Penguin online animal, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figure pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more items in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle fabric animal.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children over 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he endures a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived for some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are becoming softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, giving orders with military authority and a dampened voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust guardians of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their inclination to violence - to impress viewers.
"Stand straight!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely grown out of teenage years, wearing white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers, were stubborn.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white stripes.
"To me, they look average," Mr. Tang remarks in contempt.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The Guangdong province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low rigidity: in 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled an incorrectly placed snack cart and stared at the operator until it packed up and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing urban police strips, specially selected for their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are meant to give the coarsely slaughtered police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may enforce the city laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat a spectator to death as he filmed them with his mobile phone, shooting a protest against a dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handshake with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street traders.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for “really thorough cleansing.”
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly insufficient.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits by advertisement in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women between the ages of 18 and 22 were searched for with good figure and "harmonic facial features".
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too physically exhausting.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official told quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first of all on their outward appearance, such as height, weight, facial traits, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they still have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district’s city administration, would not agree with this description,
However, he admitted that in China, size requirements in job advertisements are not unusual for both genders.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is to be equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disability do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lame or buckling here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple pies and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel sexist that so much emphasis was placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the digging, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, “We have the task of representing the image of the city.”
According to their accounts, they do not regret the short-term attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply shunning traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning there are about twelve street traders who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bike before they are driven away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you this so many times!" explains Mr. Xu to a trader who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is monotonous rather than exhausting.
“It’s almost the same every day,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure sales.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate traders’ goods, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public hostility to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, ravaged after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the nightly incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown down or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared such violence so far.
However, unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officers patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner screamed Zeter and Murder.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the grim-faced officers made their way to their vehicles and drove off on the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male police coordinator, was left behind, turning his white nameplate around to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained in presenting a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes, but also physically," Mr. Li explains soberly.
“Most of the time, people start fighting.”
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Justice Department have acquitted Senator John Ensign of charges raised against him following his affair with a former election helper and his attempt to provide her husband with lobbying, the Senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
This decision ends the heaviest charge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, until the scandal that drove headlines nationwide and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign’s office announced, he was “highly pleased” with the ruling after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been discontinued and that there are no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department did not comment on the case.
The ruling came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, and they believe there was sufficient evidence that Ensign violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents first released in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, helped to make lucrative orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as Treasurer during an election campaign for Ensigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work, and according to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after hiring Hampton's lobbying.
Since Hampton was recently on Ensign’s electoral team, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the case, violated the so-called ban on turn-door lobbying.
According to the published indications, “it appears to be an agreement and a violation of the revolving door statutes,” according to Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Justice Department officially declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethic lawyers said the ministry appears very cautious in picking up political charges after a variety of defeats have been pursued by the media with great interest, including last year’s decision to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Steven’s misconduct.
Prosecutors “are obviously terrifying,” said Melanie Sloan, chairwoman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington Association, a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign.
“This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day informing him that the ministry would not bring any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign’s defenders had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
“I’m not going to go into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me, but let’s just say that we believe we made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the federal election commission decided to stop the investigation into a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, according to which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbying work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that, after the company continued Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing’s Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, telling him that he was “belling” at the Home Office on a matter.
Mr. Ensign also had an appointment for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after it had discontinued Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
When information about this affair first came out last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican rankings.
After noticing for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigations, his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes the Ethics Committee will follow the example of the Justice Department very quickly and cease its investigations.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work serving the people of Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire call draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them tapped into the riots in the courtroom.
Within minutes, they sent their reports of gruesome witness testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape process and children chained at beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the carefully pursued trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, will come to an official end when the judgement on the death sentence issued by the jury falls.
However, Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already filed applications in court, outlining the reasons for an appeal, and which the courts will deal with for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense reporting on the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – led to a “circus atmosphere” and such a widespread, immediate penetration of upheaval details that the jury had been impermissibly influenced by public outrage.
This objection could prompt the appeals courts to examine whether new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
“Just as I have experienced it during this trial, I think it’s really a danger if the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects everyone’s right to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye’s chief defender.
The presiding judge of the Supreme Court, Jon C. Blue, dismissed the motions briefly and fluently last week when he said that the New Media would be “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court claims have found that reporting on famously infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 ruling, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the ruling against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who allegedly killed his wife, saying in his ruling that there was a “carnival atmosphere in the courtroom” because of the New Media.
Some believe that the TV series and feature film "On the Escape" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court claims that Mr. Haye’s conviction a half-century later might follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication paths from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of the Dr. Sheppard case.
“There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in lawsuits that are being pursued by a broad public,” said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appeals courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication out of the courtroom could make trials fairer.
The Twitter affair is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers present to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
For example, the defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes may have already been pre-convicted when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the juror selection.
Some of the jurors said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their breeders, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, had filled them with aversion.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor’s office, and that he put inadmissible pressure on the judgment when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a ruling they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor’s office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media continually reignited the flames of emotions about the case.
“Such a daily rush of media pipsters, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “has not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide.”
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news items are more exhilarating than reports that are being returned more slowly is an anti-technology look that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
But some lawyers said appeals courts would often face the argument that social and technical changes needed adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling, in which Dr. Sheppard’s conviction for reporting was lifted, and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign of insults and negativity, little politeness broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before one quickly returns to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders gave no breakthrough on the major issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called “lame duck session,” the session at the end of a period of government in which no more decisions will be made.
According to all you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an observance of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan accumulation of points.
The public meeting of the President’s deficit commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that covers up the ideological divide that continues to separate members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of willingness to cooperate and compromise, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, donations, health or accruals, the two sides are miles from each other.
At least for a short time, Washington voted mildly in the November election.
“No question, the tone has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official Bush administration official now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after the elections.
Elections awaken party passions that are dying again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the “lame duck session,” Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.”
Bush’s tax cuts ended at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all of them, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment pay is to be expected, albeit only because Republicans cannot afford to believe favored tax cuts for the rich while denying support to unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, optimism has risen that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful collaboration on urgent issues of the lame duck session does not necessarily have to lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - which leads to true cooperation.
“I see a lot of what happens from now until 2012 as a pre-match, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their formation.
However worried the Republican leaders may be that they are playing too high poker, they know that they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and override health reform.
These party lines are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the raising of the pension age and the lowering of government spending.
Vice-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, in their own opinion, pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are struggling very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, because in financial matters, at least today, there is little room or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republicans challenge Obama over the state budget, taxes and health care system, later followed by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the bias of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and the Congressional Republicans than it was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a much more far-reaching election in 2012.
From this point of view, the courtesy that is being shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and it passes a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, according to the US Embassy in Russia in a memo in February.
Both the police and the state security service are blackmailing large amounts of protection so that they can maintain their expensive living standards in Moscow, it is said.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy -- what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called a "vertical of authority" -- takes its share of the money that the ladders move upwards.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on his homepage by WikiLeaks on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow’s mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that he would have been cleared up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption for years, and he has won numerous libel lawsuits against such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s dirty, it’s dirty.”
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to surveys.
But it is unusual, as the ambassador’s report does, for individuals to be named, and it is unheard of that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct link between the Moscow government and crime has led some to call it ‘interfered’ and conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government,” the memo said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘kryshna’ (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means ‘roof’ or protection), which extends over the police, state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
“Lastly, ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors are on the lowest level.”
“This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city offers no help whatsoever.”
The report continues to say that the FSB is collecting money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, it is said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) as they not only have more weapons, resources, and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law.”
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that while collecting funds is comprehensive, the protection itself will not be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases presumably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, said recently in an interview.
“But he’s part of this bureaucracy.”
“It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia.”
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, it estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries ranked from "less corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American embassy, which happened late in the evening after Moscow, will certainly cause displeasure within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angry to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest, we wouldn’t have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know.”
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Confront Past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he took care of his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Due to his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge castle in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
Yet this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing supporters are being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a schoolbook that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a community court of the UN and Cambodia first sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodia's society more difficult.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.
“It splits families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overhaul or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and in 1979 the Pol Pot-Ied government overthrew, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia’s border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the western mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok drew the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to run over to government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh Prison, where he waited for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the depleting poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
“These people have benefited very little from the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
“But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The mandate of the court is to condemn the ancient leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials at the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers were believed to have died.
On a hot evening Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court brought her, she would refuse to go, she said.
“Cambodia lives in peace and stability,” she said.
"If there were no more persecution, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court charged more suspects, although experts and historians are discussing this.
"Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
“Reconciliation with the Khmer eras means bringing the broken pieces together,” he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that we can understand everything.”
The center created the first government-approved schoolbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the High School History Book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new schoolbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
“My family rejects many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
“They’re suspicious because they’re not sure how many people are being convicted by the court.”
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the schoolbook and the court gradually gain influence,” he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Above in the Dangrek mountains, a path overgrown by shrubs and dirty with plastic garbage leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tires.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the street, said she doesn’t know much about the man who was burned here.
“But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here are going to pray to him,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will lay a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that it will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to no longer accumulate weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure global nuclear materials, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect high-enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to persuade Belarus to no longer collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements had been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-capable uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee, who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The deal appears to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s “Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations” in April, which ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the [2012] nuclear security summit."
“That proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement “a very important, important step” by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How do we retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basically weapon-capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“That’s our raw material ... we won’t make it dirty bombs and we won’t sell it to anyone.”
“We use it exclusively for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the US a few months ago when it indicated interest in reaching an agreement.
The first launch to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that took more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second call was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for this effort, with much of the money going into Belarusian research using poorly enriched uranium that cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy ministry representative working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Release Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of gunable uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents enveloped by WikiLeaks and sent to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable), adding that former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are being adequately monitored."
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe indicting aid to human rights-defying practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega spoke.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "has met Zapatero aside" and reaffirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "unpreparedly surprised," Aguirre reports via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "would not pay much attention to this matter, although the government has few possibilities of influence, since these lie in the hands of the judges."
Prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of documents from the Spanish Central Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense about the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the “apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors” than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
At a luncheon in March 2007, attended by the U.S. ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely keen on their independence and do what they deem appropriate," he instructed his employees to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments to let the tension blow off."
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP’s approach in this matter.
“Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from an indication that Zapatero’s government has tolerated or intentionally ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, will hit capital, even if these disclosures could have a negative impact on the U.S. government,” he said.
The child murderer confesses that she complained on the internet about the "mature" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in the Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one girlfriend, both of whom are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, where she was born.
Communications are from 2008.
To understand them, one must know their love life, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimonies of their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tú<0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she disbanded her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his own, but his former ones never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring congregation.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke up and they separated.
In March 2008, she was alone in Menorca, writing: "Alberto is very odd and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he liked it, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not be free to do and let go of what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send the boy to you."
She complains, “If he doesn’t like me leaving the boy with my mother, I’ll pick him up when I get back.”
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to imagine myself for a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she takes her firstborn with her if everything goes well.
"He will be the one where he needs to be, that is, with me. I will never leave him with anyone in my life except my mother," a doubtful intention when considering their bad relationship.
There is another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand Caesar is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She talks about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer class, so I have fewer expenses for the nanny."
17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A huge kiss from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, one more thing: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer class to learn Catalan."
From Victor, her current partner, there’s one: “He’s shooting money at me.”
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison releaser".
"Terror a la gallega".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting overseer, says he has been conscientious because he feels guilty.
He can’t believe it all happened because she hadn’t told him that she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Menorca Prisoner's Court Center to Palma Province Prison.
The compulsory defender, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not remember the course of the case, "and she had no intention of doing damage to the little one."
Before that, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and hiding his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - preferentially or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party gets in these elections is usually twice that of the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this number in the 2006 regional elections was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend – the result of the redirection of the PSC’s voting share and the retention of the PP’s voter base – should continue, the PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while also CiU would lose four (it now has 10) and the PSC would gain at least 9 MPs (of 25)
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one deputy - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its deputy or win one.
Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to socialist dominance, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the Socialists cannot win a majority or rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not wrong that this party will lose its representation in the Municipal Council of Barcelona, where it would have to get 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they will be able to play the leading role in Tarragona's transformation, where they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
In Lérida the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party has seen a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell secured thousands of passports from Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerians arrested by the police of the Barcelona Police Intelligence Service formed the jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, the different al-Qaeda groups, including the "Tamil Eelam Liberation Movement" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the attacks in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure that “Operation Kampai” has “weakened” Al Qaeda’s counterfeiting apparatus worldwide and “hence its ability to act”.
The researchers estimate that in the two years the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups of the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their “fighters” could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without punishment.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe. That is why other European police units have also participated in the investigation, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies. It is not to be ruled out that there will be similar attacks in the EU territory in the coming days as the one that was carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistani Sirikan Athar Butt and Zeeshan Butsan were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - particularly stole tourist passports according to the guidelines of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men between the ages of 25 and 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have any visa stamps.
Investigators have pointed out that so far no links have been established between the detainees in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, despite the fact that the perpetrator of the attack, Laschkar e-Taiba, was one of the recipient groups of the stolen passports in Spain and subsequently counterfeited in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that several thousand dollars had been sent from Catalonia through a money transfer company a few days before the assassination, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, later used by the members of the "command", which ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas to postpone tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to present to Artur Mas personally her terms in support of his inauguration as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already presented during the campaign and can be combined with the priority of the economic recovery and the absence of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement.
The leader of the Catalan People’s Party turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 deputies she won last Sunday - a number that is more than enough to feel indispensable because the candidate from the CiU bourgeois-regionalist party is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to abstain from voting when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible agreement with the PP. The talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders, however, are all about Catalonia.
As for the party chairman of the PPC, it demands that in support of the inauguration of office "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on financial compensation between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to in the Basque Country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, be employed behind.
It is common to both political leaders that they want to make the developed political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and to abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for Mas's inauguration are dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home reiterates that the deaths are not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the nursing home in Olot do not rule out that their nurse killed over eleven elderly people
The officials of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they highlighted the damage Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - had done to the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, went to court in the company of his lawyer, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, announcing that "La Caritat wants to charge those responsible for the deaths", but "the law and our liability compel us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a loss of social reputation because it had not detected the criminal acts of the nurse in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims’ family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and diseases were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat roundly denied this point, stating that "failure to take measures could not have been the reason for the incidents at any time."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there would be no indication of the negligent acts of any person other than the accused in the litigation."
The man, who was baptized as a "death angel", confessed to eleven murders yesterday and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and that he had murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said the access of the staff to the drugs was difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering upon death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them out from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had confessed to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
La Caritat does not believe the nurse’s statements, not even as far as the number of murders admitted, which could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made it available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threatened by the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
The risk surcharges of the euro peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be mistaken and that the euro has barely increased in points, which is cause for concern.
Yesterday’s events are typical of an illiquid market that recovers as it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity assumptions, whereby tomorrow, for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future, the ECB has to make a withdrawal.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of government debts, as these are ineffective, and the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended “at least until March” and the quarterly tender with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that the bond purchase program will continue and send a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of yesterday’s markets will be thrown back, and if we are insisting on withdrawing our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, when the bank reiterated that it did not consider buying government debt and markets collapsed, this story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persevering.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state bonds in Portugal was quite weak.
State asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the entire curve, reflecting a change in the perception of markets according to Trichets.
In Ireland, Allied and Bank of Ireland’s debt hole figures have been published.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10 000 million in the short term and a further 15,000 possible. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after not recognizing the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the government must get parliamentary approval for its new budget, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate in view of the summit of heads of state and government on December 14, where political unity is required to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish president presented yesterday the plan of action, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the government deficit, liberalization, privatization and labour procurement measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response from the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are relying on strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our debt restructuring capacity.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury Office has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are very expensive and access to the markets would be closed without deadline.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar’s wife’s motto: “Now it is not only being that counts, but also the appearance.”
Be brave, we can do it!
The Chairman of the Management Board of Owls contests the shareholders’ meeting of Vega Sicilia at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of the companies Owls and El Enebro, does not fade.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the company's group, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, because he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over control of a part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company seems unwilling to surrender in his dispute over control of El Enebro’s bodies.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who appointed themselves to the Board of Directors at the Shareholders’ Meeting on January 18th of this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The meeting of shareholders of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Madrid Commercial Court No. 2 for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderbolt in the lap of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The summoning of the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the meeting of shareholders.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "despairing means of the applicants - his five children - to have the official assembly of January 18 declared void by means of legal snippets, fraudulent machinations and legal abuse.
This argument is the basis for the challenge of the assembly in retrospect in order to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, covering themselves in discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro - a holding company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez's seven children control 100% of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use over 51% of the capital.
That is the real background of the matter, which the judge has to decide on in the hearing on the treatment of the appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history has been shaped by the speed of surprises and successes in this exquisite universe.
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last seasons, in the final track last November, everyone bet on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to downplay the skills of German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into its hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with car racing.
This computer science program, dubbed PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The purpose is to accurately reproduce or simulate a product or process before it is actually built to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial department, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that are detected in the races and in the tests can design and execute.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 there were an average of ten technicians working in the stables, who were able to make three or four improvements in a season at most.
Today, Red Bull’s team employs 180 highly skilled young people, who use powerful computer systems to perform analyses and make all sorts of changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull racing cars, except for the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be translated from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula One team can spend on their races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are heavily confined.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The crew includes 580 people, including the two pilots, world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull’s true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts into the service of its participation on the race tracks, are other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is zero.
Steve Nevey, the plant’s chief technology officer, said five years ago it was still possible to say that progress in R&D for racing cars contributed to victory with 50 percent and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, share values have changed, with technology accounting for 85 percent of the success, while pilots’ contribution is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to open 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty stores of 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees to this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in the multi-brand operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairwoman of HP Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted shop on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 offices in Spain.
The first ones were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The Deputy Chairman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening a store is always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry expertise.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all stores will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system, stressing that the exclusive sales outlet network was intended to "optimize customer service and advice to small and micro businesses in purchasing and afterwards, even packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system was developed especially for small and micro enterprises as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical after-sales service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' a million customers from rivals in three years
Banco Sabadell’s Managing Board member Jaime Guardiola is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he anticipates a fall in interest rates, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a subject that is still too existing.
Sabadell has found the way to make the most of the next three years and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without taking public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if you withdraw the customers that the bank will lose - is the great challenge that this bank faces, because so far it has devoted more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year, it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses.
Their market share among private customers is 3.5%, while business customers account for more than 10%.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has disrupted all bank plans around the world.
Sabadell will complete its four-year Optima guiding plan this year, initially designed for three years, but due to the market situation, it has been extended for one fiscal year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
In a breakfast hosted by the APIE, Guardiola emphasized that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with wide reach".
The manager assumes that Spain will only come “slowly” out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental for the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war over liabilities - which penalizes interest margins - is going to blow away, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks have to pay for their liquidity-sustaining issues will already be rolled over to the loan prices in compensation for declining profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn off the cock, but the interest rate differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
On Thursday, Banesto issued the order to its branch network to restrict the allocation of long-term loans and increase the interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the stategie of "increasing fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s guiding plan is based on organic growth, even if the group does not exclude corporate business, as always.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain “larger companies are needed.”
“Everything will change next year,” he assured.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently “rising tremendously” and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red numbers.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in case of capital stocks.
Having assured that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of markets, he undermines the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be put into circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, it is possible to obtain short-term financing through repo transactions and thus intercept the crisis.
CECA excludes a second wave of savings bank merger
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday denied the possibility of a wave of mergers of savings banks, stressing the speed with which the sector will be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not insist on participating in the first phase.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was rather adjustments."
"Most of it is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all important processes are already completed. They were controlled by Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, which has strongly supported all operations."
In a breakfast organized by the Association of Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely expiration that was established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained that "there would be a series of inappropriate opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed fussiness and nonsense," because "Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a urges us to conclude by the end of the year."
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" the whole world, adding that those who doubted would do so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic situation we need to “not worry” about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have undergone a “very significant” concentration process that will be carried out “as soon as possible”.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to retain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the lifting of the €426 support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lotter.
On the other hand, the Deputy Prime Minister, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible, which has incited the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, this is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of a large part of its partners.
Given the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the German Mark - although this currently sounds more like science fiction - , supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a reshaping of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishment of countries that exceed the requirements; more possible the cessation of payments of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been distinguished for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of the sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was set by the Central European country when Merkel painfully pushed the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the public opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel came out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union agreements to allow the rescue of a country while at the same time requiring private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it drove the Irish crisis and all of the following.
However, their proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures to take place from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, the old way of working the euro will no longer exist from this date onwards.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the offending countries will be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent, and in this case the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to pursue a hard course of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly to not understand it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will move into more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that are offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in her own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like anything would change.
Among the options considered is the fact that we would have to leave the euro area full of poorly reputable countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sport and bypassing rules
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show the spirit of invention, but not the willingness to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being shed on whether it was an unsportsman or not and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so that the referee would show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next league game against Auxerre and thus enter the next phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club’s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules followed in this sport.
Part of the debate about the case is that a team from the football club Real Madrid (who professed nobility and honor in his anthem and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the lead, and the dramatization by Mourinho, who has added an episode more to his long history than a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behaviour, which is explicitly prohibited by the statutes, does not contradict the principles of sport, that is to say whether these acts constitute an circumvention of the rules, in fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is avoiding the opposing players from gaining an unjustified benefit from the opposing team.
The paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we normally mean by wrong play or bypassing rules, because the bypass of the rule was not carried out in secret to avoid a sanction, but it should be as noticeable as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage did the offenders draw from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasized here that the rival was not put in a less favourable position nor were any advantages required for the game being played, because the obvious result of this action was that their own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players begin the next phase of the Champions League game without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, to a certain degree, uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually retire, and players will receive a penalty with this approach and move into the second card cycle, in which they retire less than in the first card cycle due to card accumulation.
It is not so clear whether it really is an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sports spirit, which includes strategic decisions to make the most of the regulations.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a sanction (that would actually be a clear case of circumvention), they wanted to choose when to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without evading a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between inventiveness and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the rule transmission provoked.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer campaign to catch customers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations to the 16th and 17th of December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners during the pre-Christmas season, which provide oxygen to the restaurant and recreational sectors of Barcelona. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which represents the large mass. Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirm the questionnaire
To make the accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (New Year’s Eve falls on a Friday) dropped all orders into the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of reservations of dinners to two top counters (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have discontinued group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to give up this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation may be, low prices are required, confirms the chairman of the Barcelona restaurant board, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the umbrella association does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
“People think about it ten times before they make a reservation.”
“They want to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices,” he stresses.
The business will go well with those who "provide quality at good prices with good service," he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices of 25 euros are most in demand.
A survey of several centrally located restaurants shows that the evening of December 17 leads the providers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says demands for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to advance reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 stores, optimism is not lost, after the revenues have blossomed again since the second quarter and good prospects for the Christmas business are expected, albeit concentrated on a few days.
Sources from the company group highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus was added a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more as a price hit. It gives the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies you can also see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are back on the rise.
From the side of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with mergers such as the bar, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts it to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are overall quite "living", although the customers "take out a maximum".
The fun of celebrating, however, has not declined, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises great concern in the United States
Islamabad is making nuclear weapons “faster than any other country.”
Wikileaks revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the margins of the clarifying and juicy details that the documents on the contents of the talks and the way of thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad provide, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not being strengthened, but on the contrary "decreasing", and that the unstable Asian country is making more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm" than any other country.
Particularly the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
In a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, said: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumed dispersal of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material.”
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenal and missile programs is no longer seen only by the United States, but also by Russia, as an overwhelming and reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan needs to hire strictly devout personnel to guard nuclear facilities; due to the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programs," Yuri Korolev, a Russian foreign ministry expert, said in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentary revealed by Julian Assange’s web portal is that US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is declining and the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" declared: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive answers to offers of aid or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that “despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as fast as any other country.”
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to “clarify” the person responsible that “Pakistan’s army has to cease its tacit support of terrorist groups.”
Hunting for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further revelations.
Interpol is issuing a red warning to pursue and locate Assange.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red warning” about the “discovery and persecution” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Also, it is not new, it is from November 20.
It also has nothing to do with the latest disclosure of more than four million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Wikileaks founder Mark Stephens’ lawyer said the police “would know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
The order was issued by the international police agency based in Lyon (France) on 20 January at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the authority was obtained by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are ordered to identify and locate Assange "to temporarily arrest and deliver him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organization, many member countries consider the red warning to be a release letter for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be staying.
Assange’s lawyers, who issued a letter yesterday informing the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder is willing to answer the Swedish authorities’ questions via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested to leave Sweden and received permission from the prosecutor, who is compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal prosecution," the letter said.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia pleads for her son's innocence - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave the head of Time magazine an interview via Skype from an indefinite location, requesting the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign,” he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation “ ridiculous and absurd.”
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama’s spokesman to pay Assange less attention is contrary to the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to seize their funds and pursue anyone who supports them or contributes.”
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange must be "murdered".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever leaked information into the government is guilty of treason and everything that is not execution is a too mild punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the principle of the General Assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the twentieth time an internal riot in the ranks of the directionless ERC after the loss of 11 MEPs and half of the voters.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for those close to former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not cause him the same headache as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries with a wink to win the new critics, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the start yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could speak secretly about his stay in office.
With ballot papers, not with a raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to give the President a penalty bill, they could do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he affirmed that he would feel with half of the votes plus one unconfirmed, and he added without specifying percentages that a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
Carod’s proximity demands more from the president than just giving his office to the party, an inadequate gesture, as Puigcercós controls the highest body of congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the Executive Board on an action plan from now until May.
In doing so, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation, which the management will present to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós, in return he promises to postpone Congress in the fall of 2011, which the party leader already considers to be a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that the “polyphony” hurts stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the incumbent consul Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for various purposes".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructure" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the general assembly principle as a way of working.
In this way, he advocates a reform of the statutes that will allow the congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcercós's team, who fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with the termination of the model of the General Assembly - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the 2008 earthquake meeting, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of the General Assembly at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as the internal turmoil of recent years has not been advisable to deal with this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors in the lurch, the time might have come to retake this issue and to end it forever.
23 murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO count, there were four fewer cases in México than in 2010.

A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, two dead women wrapped in blankets were discovered in the Zoquiapan settlement of the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan was found the corpse of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, who, according to the news that his murderers left next to him, was probably named Mario Ríos.
In the San Francisco Acuautla settlement of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman with shots of firearms was found in her neck.
On the skin of the woman, tattoos of Santa Muerte were discovered, as well as chains with corresponding images.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found next to a vehicle in the municipality of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men, whose heads were covered with tape, and a message were discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the body was a message, presumably signed by a criminal organization, which read: "This happens to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet with traces of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the judicial center of the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and tied up in black plastic bags, there was a message next to it; the second had been tortured and was found in the streets of the settlement of Juárez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China upholds targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of China said at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and that it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is keeping its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th UN World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and reshape its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million over the past four years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year that includes the targets for reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, state authorities had cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of saving energy, efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he said that some multi-year plans have already been initiated or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Efficient Energy Program, which was introduced over the past five years and had received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and privately.
There is also a provincial project on climate change, another to replace traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs and another to mitigate and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts were far greater than was commonly assumed.
He showed that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China amount to six tonnes per person, while in the United States they are 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a total of nine percent of the pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent over the past five years and another is expected by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former panist party chairman had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and demand what the right would afford him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and demand what the right afforded him.
In an interview with the state governor, Gabino Cué Monteagudos, before the complaint was filed, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision that had been taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Commission of Order in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right, in his case, to appeal to the Commission de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said it was not the time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional, strengthened, emerged from the internal vote on December 4th and 5th, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a prelude to the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, which is why “internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, we enjoy it and it strengthens us,” he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman, which Acción Nacional would need for the next three years, so he would hand over the stafettes "to those whom the Council would appoint."
"I am completely unconcerned and open there, and I would be proud to transfer the office of party chairman to each of the five."
He predicted that the party’s upturn in the last July 4 elections would be reflected in the upcoming elections, although “it’s not time to think about 2012.”
"Now the goal is to support Governor Gabino Cué in his mission."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would be flagged and watched throughout the country, which is why "many hopes and longings are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is on the level of the demands."
When questioned about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his disc course during his four-year government, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year term of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, should they start defending them, should they finally come out of the closet,” he said.
He believes that the owner of the federal government could make expressions like those he could make in his discourse at the Auditorio Nacional, because there would be no ban on speech and even less censorship in this country.
Obama supports Twitter for undocumented students
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the passing of that law,” the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - the law to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the passing of that law,” Obama tweeted.
His briefing contains a cyberlink to a broader document that calls on the public to come in touch with their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
“With your voice we’re waiting for, the time has come to listen to you,” he said.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law except expanding tax cuts from Bush’s time and funding the government would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could impact the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the remaining projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be resolved before the end of the year..."
“I think we can make an agreement on it at any time and then we can plan the rest,” he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would ask for a vote at the end of the debate" to allow the Dream Act law, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students to be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act Act or the Law of the American Dream would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, have lived in that country for the past five years and are enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At the moment, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intense influence on the passage of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
That is why the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most successful Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took office as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had advocated for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate faces the biggest obstacles.
Putting your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust to Speech' was a walk, in which the participants were strong for the narrative
"I understand that with sex in language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was supposed to open the second round of 'Los plagues de la langue', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-speaking literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion.
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble", the Argentine writer spitted sweetly to the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text, which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then characterized Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from which she receives no answer, but hints for the guide of her story
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath in the middle of the corridor, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the truly open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs relieved and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it was really open and did not exist", but she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative he called 'Praise of Invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back men who traveled far or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a twist and told of America, the great novel that was not lacking from the beginning to his own chronicler, and he quoted the story of Bernal Díaz del Castillo.
“Cervantes, who invited us all, mocked the fake witness who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told — with imagination that even the feeling of shame disappeared.”
However, he emphasizes that "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things", and there reality and lie approach each other, where one no longer knows which side belongs to the narrative, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
This is actually called the Cervantes tradition.
"From him we inherited to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero’s turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL’s invitation to the round table ‘The Finger in the Wound’ had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican devoted her contribution to the great wound of the social violence that plagues her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles over the drug trade.
“I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unintentionally planned commitment,” she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a “chemical reaction.”
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also raised "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness will also result in dogmatism, forgetting that "behind every confirmation is a small no and behind every denial a small yes."
To be in possession of our thought and reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means to put a finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful who prefer to write the world in black and white.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final game, two different styles are also opposed, defined by their respective coaches, and their encounter characterized by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has held on well, which is why this opportunity is of very particular importance to him.
The Argentine has taken the medal to the second champion, he is one step behind the winners and, surprisingly, he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santist strategist reached the first final game as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003' he achieved the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put in a setback again, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros was tied after 210 minutes, but in the penalty penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to put in his title, but in the end the three of his players missed the game.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he does not want to be pursued again and rid himself of the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he reaffirms that the game itself is the most important for him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I give away, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," the steering officer commented when asked about the lost endgames.
The last final game has remained strongly in his memory, he assured that he learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we can not celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared to leave with two yards, and I don't think that's a lesson until the game,
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shooting hands does not disturb him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared to in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes as a result of the Nervos.
It’s Romanso’s power to no longer just be second champion and taste the fame that the titles bring for the first time.
The U.S. changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must present themselves to the Consulate before their meeting with the service offices to apply for a visa; costs will be shortened in this way.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa at the U.S. embassy and consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves at the Consulate at the Service Offices for Applying for Visas (ASC, the initial letters in English) before they meet.
ASC staff shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the Consulate prior to the interview.
The new method has certain benefits for aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa decreases, because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over.
The applicant only makes a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterparty to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa application (including visa for temporary workers) and $390 for dealers and investors.
Those who only want to renew their visa do not have to have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service surcharge of $26.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visum-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called for a press conference to present a finding tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The U.S. National Aerospace Agency (NASA) is announcing an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA’s headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science that investigates the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
In convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present “a prudential find for the search for extraterrestrial life,” sparking speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures could exist in hostile environments previously thought to be uninhabitable, hypothesizing that they could transform into intelligent creatures - just like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it is a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment believed to be too toxic to all imaginable life forms because the lake is heavily arsenic-containing.
In some way, the microbe uses arsenic as a survival resource. Considering this ability, the chances are that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually a different form of life, a second form of life that differs from that known to us."
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its fund at the press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon on Saturn) on the question of whether its chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
The reform of the Organic Law on Congress will introduce the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, had already been installed, which presented itself as an independent. The four questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the start of the introductory session in the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the Organic Law, as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties controlling Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency led by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally established their political marginalization with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, and that if they did not, they would be subjugated again by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
“So far I’m here (the opposition coalition), that’s what I see, because we’re excluded from all decisions that don’t even consider taking into account the opinions of others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said there was agreement with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, is now supposed to be "duopolistic".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that Congress should have an eternal two-party system.”
"For the start, this group starts with five MEPs and they are talking to other colleagues so that they become more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, referring to PAN and PRI, said that the congress has now become a 'loot' for two.
"Before it was just one party, now they split it up in two."
Patrón Montalvo called for respect for the MEPs and for their place at the negotiating tables.
"Five, which are currently seen as split into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform that has been carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed out and we disagree with this reform."
200 000 Peso more for "the supplier"
The municipality of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check of just over 200,000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the amount paid to the owner of the company for electrical materials in the second half of the year amounts to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued for an amount of 200,144,56 peso with the number 9258447 was issued last November 16 with the purpose of "invoicing of open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier, which is monitored by the Auditoria Superior del Estado because it is sold at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount owed to her and, as a result, the number of checks still issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought from her, it's just paying off the debts, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is challenged by the ASE to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be reused.
After the newspaper Noroeste published on 25 July the audit of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it became known that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and throw a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the trade association of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on various occasions it was called on to maintain the destination and turn the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks had had a negative impact, as tourists would come to stroll and see the disorder, whereupon they would turn their backs to the nearby shops.
"Politics don't know what it means to have to shut down a company one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work slowly and unplanned."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community has to take responsibility and avoid doing something like this again. How to do it? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything in retrospect," he explained.
"We look forward to having a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito de Mazatlan."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists, we need to offer a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps tourist attractions constantly in check," he added.
“These arrangements have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán because they were not being used properly and created a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the forefront along with the city. To make the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be cleaned and cleaned up in order to make them attractive for tourism and to supply them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take the great responsibility to set a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The business sector of Mazatlán demands a dignified parliament, free from compromises between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces great problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do clean work, to feel committed to society and to the different societal groups that rely on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurship Coordination Council, suggested that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
“We hope that MPs will truly exercise their right to act free of agreements between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, with which they transform themselves into carnival comparators of the governing and the leaders of parliamentary groups.”
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We take care that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the major challenges facing the 40 people’s representatives was to drive and work together for the economic growth of the state, as the economic situation is now extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will somehow promote job creation."
As regards the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary priority in the state budget to promote it.
"I understood that it is the ministry with the second fewest means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourism projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which was not redrafted in previous legislatures, must be updated.
The Holy King is wanted
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys are eagerly desired by the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
On the next day of the Three Kings, it will be difficult for the parents to fulfill these wishes, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a humble house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes it's tough because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go out on the streets with the boys for sale," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The 10-year-old José Alfredo has long wanted to have a 'monster car' and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús proposes Cayetana clothes in the size of one-year-old.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I would like this monster so much,' but I replied, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old Maria Guadalupe is size 12, the ten-year-old Isaiah is size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel is size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King Is Wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network, ten home searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were said to have been predominantly drug-producing.
“Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec security police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom are considered the main wire pullers of the drug ring, coming from Sherbrooke.
The detainees are said to have appeared hours after their arrest in front of the judicial building in Sherbrooke.
They could be charged, among other things, with the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale purposes, conspiracy, and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place for over a year.
“The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests,” Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the Estrien Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Authority had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be tracked
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says will address the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is expected to be stamped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter."
“I’m holding on to a party that has tied your feet to shackles,” Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, said after the end of the weekly caucus meeting before the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows anyone to be held for up to one year by a seafarer identified as carrying illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he turned against the wrong target group.
“We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government is doing,” Duceppe said.
The criticism of the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has turned away the critics who demanded that their party not behaved steadfast enough towards the secret immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree to take action against blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to enforce by mediating another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
We therefore do not support the Conservatives’ bill, because it seeks to blame the refugees and hold children in prison for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians urgently inform MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of covert immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and treat the country like a kickback.”
“They expect Canada to take tough action,” Kenney’s response said.
“The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
One conservative, however, told the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote so that every opposing MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new standing unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea does not stem from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, Wednesday’s announcement has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the permanent committee of the Quebec police service on October 29 last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was also not lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as "a rabbit enchanted from the hat" and "a solution made right at a table end".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the future unity in question.
“They will see the result when we announce it,” he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to form an investigative committee is to resign Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer on ethics and political systems at the ENA.
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposes to Quebec to grant a special mandate to audit so that it can conduct appropriate investigations into corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give audit control the same power as Commissioners, which would also allow it to compel people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government of Charest.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be more responsive to this type of crime.
This request comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part, confirmed that his justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this case.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected motorcycle police groups, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been revised.
As a result, Ottawa enforced the anti-gangster law.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has spilled since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains of 40 to 70 milliliters of rainfall have poured into several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimeters of additional precipitation were expected to be rainfall by Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen here.
Since snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, warnings were issued by the Quebec security service about the flood alarm concerning the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentian Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring here and continue to be observed.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was torn apart due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, according to security adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec State Highwater Centre issued warnings on Wednesday of the strong rise of several rivers, especially of Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially corrected
Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) for his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians as well as for his lackluster speech on radio.
The CCNR believes that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their opinions, but that certain statements "contain inaccurate information about the social welfare and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians, as well as such a rude speech that is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which involves the dissemination of the names of two people who committed suicide, violates the broadcasting code.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasts broadcast during the period 2008 and 2010.
The first order was made following a complaint from the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Rather, moderators should provide solid information as misleading.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" program in question would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not blamed in any way against his person.
The last issue was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given themselves a media-effective discussion that had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he did not donate to Haiti because he was unsure if the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not abusive in character, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
“I’ve already served my three-day suspension sentence on this matter.”
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of an improper expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, among other things, had to communicate his decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact kung fu), in kickboxing and in Thai boxing, now climbs on the tatami and into the boxing rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago," Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008, said in a statement.
I personally look for the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fight, as it is presented by mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, the one working as a security officer and employed at the company UPS had given his rivals bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the amateur world championship held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he explained.
"At the moment I'm preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China."
"The fighters from each category were invited to the top four at the last World Championship."
"I brought babe 2009 in Toronto bronze."
"In 2005 I became eighth in Vietnam."
“In 2007 I finished fifth in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto,” he added.
“It’s worth noting that I’ve made progress in every competition.”
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, in which punches and kicks are allowed as well as ground throws.
The two matches usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer who emerged from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal held back only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most respected in China," said the sympathetic pound guy.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
“That was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real professional,” he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the King of Kung-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant $450 million in contracts to project planning firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the main share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "Energy Gérance", was formed in 2004 as an accompaniment to Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over its responsibility to the private sector to this important, $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" entered into the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distorting competition and increasing prices.
"This is a new way of playing a map game and it undermines the competition."
“This means that we are now conducting games in an open form instead of carded games instead of in a secret way,” PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at the press conference yesterday.
Early in the morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract was a discarded game.
“I remain true to my line,” she said, adding that the PQ was “dishonest” and “it lacked hardness.”
She said it's "the least" that the PQ apologizes.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise regarding a bid on a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is underway and is expected to be in place by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without any competition; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is by no means an exception for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief fly-over of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Every link, and of which there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
Regarding the Energy Gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay is subject to a special labour force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying particular attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has caused the nose about the fact that the contract for project management has been approved according to agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will go up fast."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell yourself: they will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte said.
This contract granted to the Energy Gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts over more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
According to a review, Le Devoir had more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts awarded to companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had acquired 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "Energie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "Energy Gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti liberal du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had warned that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that "financed" it, before clarifying that it was rather their leaders.
Barometer Responsible Consumption - The "green" label is not trustworthy
Greener, but unwaveringly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but neither does it have confidence in the labeled brands or eco-labels that are intended to control his choice.
Too bad, although it bathes in a media-effective universe, where it is so full of information in favor of a more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy that is recognized as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading showed yesterday.
Although they pushed the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec's population admits that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as much as they do in green corporate advertising, according to the sophisticated measuring instrument used by the University of Sherbrooke's responsible consumer centre.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this segment, which is currently animated by nearly one-third of Quebec’s consumers.
In fact, emptiness and doubtful nature of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
After the higher price of the products, this is the second brake identified by the barometer.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are distrustful of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to deliver.
According to another report, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mostly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases from traders in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible – the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year – the Homo consumer of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But the social and ecological consciousness seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have reported using public transport in 2010 or preferring the ride-sharing centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also favored by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the clichés.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was asked by the Société Angus and the company Parallele to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agreed to a cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallele, who had hoped to receive a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the cinema complex eXcentris belonging to Daniel Langlois on Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to hand it over to its true cinematic function, apparently did not receive what they demanded.
The government has agreed to get involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond at a lower level than initially hoped for, which could create a viable solution on favorable conditions, at least according to sources derived from the state’s rumor kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the request has been revised downwards.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who directs the eXcentris file.
Several days ago he had sent her a final factual report.
However, the cabinet’s counter-proposal was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallele and Angus now have time to respond until 31 December.
In any case, the premise of state donation seems to have been really pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec community of owners of cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against direct government investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture did not have to provide financial assistance for real estate projects there that he did not have to provide to other cinemas as well.
In contrast, however, several other market participants in the segment claimed substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the author’s cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years under great difficulties, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clients at the bar.
The Société Angus and the company Parallele with Christian Yaccarini at the top, for their part, are running a privately funded campaign, from which they expect a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only a single screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallelle.
The goal of the future purchasers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des godux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not recall the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward-corrected proposals made to them.
Secret of Complex Shaken Canada Revealed
The new U.S. diplomatic lines disseminated by WikiLeaks uncover the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the Canadians’ inferiority complex to the Americans, but they uncover with the same blow the latter’s sense of superiority to Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind at the ballot, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly disseminated yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantive content you have to nibble on.
A link dated 22 September 2008, during the period of the federal election campaign in full swing, reports on the extent to which the United Nations is no longer participating in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador deployed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
“A complex of inferiority that is almost inherent to Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life rather than push the United States to black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the Free Trade Campaign),” he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus “the proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of him.”
The ambassador understands this "ear-numbing silence" all the less, as the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
“Logically,” he says, “should it be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in voting.”
The other expression of this sense of importance can be seen in the January 22, 2009, message sent by Terry Breese, Managing Director in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the government’s continued confidence in the federal budget vote at the beginning of February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade resulting from a $30-40 billion revitalization program,” Breese said.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from being overthrown from the coalition and the conditional persistence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival program.
Another message, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, conveys to Washington the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC are broadcasting from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even deportations for the purpose of interrogations carried out by the CIA's muscle braces can be observed.
Another briefing reports extensively on how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterparts Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described, “he handed over to the Secretary of State a paper regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
“The Secretary of State has pledged to review the file again.”
Finally, let’s note that the minds are warming up about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close advisor to Stephen Harper, had told CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be “killed.”
He had talked here about Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
The UN yesterday in Cancun proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) equivalent to nearly one-third of the additional reduction that needs to be realized to stabilize the Earth’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction commitments of the developed countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFC released to Earth due to illumination would be avoided if the white-glowing bulbs, which so far still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better yet, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emission emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, from this balance sheet we would still have to deduct 5 Gt to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020, to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-burning bulbs 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice as much.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last between 6,000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED bulbs, such as the ones launched by Philips this week -- which, by the way, participated in the UN study -- have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-burning bulb, implying the savings of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a regular resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the producers provide an acceptance point.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, however, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-burning pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report outlines in detail the profits that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars a year on electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the “immediate” publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential elections immediately after their deadline.
“The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to release the preliminary results without further delay,” a press spokesman for the UN chief said.
"He asks all parties and institutions in Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the election commission had let the deadline, set on Wednesday at midnight, expire three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CIS had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from around the world were made for the CEI to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the resigning Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the Constitutional Council to cancel "deceptive" votes in the north, which were obtained by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, confirmed that the FN’s maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president’s supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the lawsuits filed by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparts are now more of a view that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically close associate of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the former rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and that a complaint to the Constitutional Court after preventing the election commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of Sunday’s presidential elections were held for the crowning of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned Ivory Coast politicians that it could be held accountable in the event of any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes compared to the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable in the metropolis at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the preliminary, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment figure in the metropolis is established at 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the participation of the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
More in-depth, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not, or whether they were job seekers or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% involving overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the youth aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Seniors, for their part, recorded a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of people over 50 years of age, 6.6% with the inclusion of the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France overall.
After a dispute over its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office, continues to use this method, announcing on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the president of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne region (PS), was brought to an investigation and he was placed in Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and fraud markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with undermining corporate property, misappropriation of general goods, heaviness, co-mortem in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on any questions that the prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading brain ghosts."
"It's easy to put him on a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had emphasized that a memorandum of justification should be sent to the judge before his hearing through his lawyers.
A relative of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep the landfill he had to run running.
With regard to the business area of competence or the destination of the related funds, he would never have known, says Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also charged on Wednesday for undermining and complicity, but then on the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts he was accused of."
"The senior prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more people were charged and released from detention on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) waste disposal plant, is being prosecuted for "unlawful influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one for the title "abduction and misappropriation of public property by a public official", the other for "cooperating in misappropriation of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini’s life partner, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with “the perversion and undermining of corporate assets.”
Among the people confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned for a similar affair of public fraud that had affected Corsica.
The searchers suspect his company of helping to launder money from “high” criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, here in particular in the disposal sector, is conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
Close sources of investigation indicate that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities in the municipal catchment area of Marseille (MPM).
Case of Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediator function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "spionage", kept the French public in the air, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on dealing with their own crisis of "hospitalization" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not mean the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner held in France and sought by the American judiciary for trade in material in favor of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss into the spotlight.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomagram published in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage-taking".
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, Elysée’s strategic advisor, spoke with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised the Americans to do their utmost to return their own nationals who were being held forcibly in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and continuously" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocent", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
“Put this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do this.”
Because "silence does not solve anything", past the discussion attempts on inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasion maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a “common Iranian tactic”: “hostage for the purpose of political extortion.”
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was to come into effect on August 16, the day she fled to the French embassy) "requests the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he makes it apparent that Elysée is anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will exacerbate itself".
The Iranians could "arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French nationals living in Iran in the near future," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but remains detained in Iran.
Information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is being demanded by the United States due to illegal trade in sensitive electronics to Iran, has been released from prison after a judge’s decision in Paris.
The American embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Does France have a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of a renewed conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, puts it on again, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare his efforts to make Syrian President Bashar al-Assad play an “important” and “influential mediator” role by means of statements and organized by the media.
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 summons "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is so much “thanksgiving” to Mr. Assad based on, the Paris embassy asks.
"Despite their statements full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts “target to confirm Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which was "perceived prematurely and undeserved by numerous critics in France and abroad".
“Boosting Syria’s role,” Paris said, “trying to show Syria what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region.”
It is also aimed at “sewing disagreement between Syria and Iran.”
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier entrusted her: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them despite everything."
“This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called “the Ash bun” that will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them from accessing, government officials suggested.
A bill to call on online gaming operators to deny young people under 16 years of age access to these games after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of ministries of culture and family said.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin said, with this bill entrusted to the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturing companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also intends to ask the manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA appoints host country
In clear excitement over suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a highly political election in which the ranking for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then look a bit more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to gain new territories (Katar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets out the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Championship.
The machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of election.
The Sunday Times, which stood at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to hold the World Cup once, namely 1966.
The BBC had once again given it ground on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that targets three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
There is reason enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English officials who had been lobbying intensively primarily with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government is hoping for a re-release of the successful chess move by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the 2012 Olympics for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort suffice to re-evaluate the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trumps with their already finished stadiums, their expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English, as well as doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stages, hotels, transport) has become a weighty outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the unwavering indication of the accusations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the committee members.
“You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
However, these new candidates seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA long-awaited 2026 World Cup approval for China, which leaves Asia’s chances of 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled all the registers with the expectation of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights acquiesced by European countries (due to the time shift), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second Mandate: Obviousness
De Gaulle really did.
Mitterrand had made him think he was stuck.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
One mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness is not well faced on the side of the mystery attached to the presidency function.
So you have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
In one sense, as well as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate could not be ruled out without believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians would signal the prospect of "two mandates" had thus spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
It's a long miss.
The President only reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years left with me at worst, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next phase."
His words of yesterday make him no more a candidate than he did the day before; but no less.
If they make comments, then for a dual reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the opening of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS are admonishing earlier than assumed to make a battle announcement.
The bad surveys on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express poll).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," the Prime Minister's environment responded immediately and cautiously.
“If he found a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate,” said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has reconciled himself with the obvious.
Euro: ECB is forced to keep its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Central Bank Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show ways to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to come to an end at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt undoubtedly cannot afford to overthrow even the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to provoke their exacerbation.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB’s active role in resolving Europe’s government debt yesterday at a press conference.
It did not dare to say whether it believed the central bank could do more, for example by boosting its program of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the occasion of his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee in Brussels the day before, was not very well-spoken about his plans, but was rather content to point out that the programme of purchases of government documents on the secondary market would be "continued" and that at the meeting on Thursday, we will "look like the decisions".
The only certainty is that the ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s bond purchases of the treasury doubled last week to around 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to indiscretions of some traders, it is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among the traders, there is no doubt about the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase price (see page 29).
The economists are no longer expecting a remarkable change in course.
If bond transactions lasting more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB will continue to create free-flowing cash reserves over a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already assured that this measure will be extended by a few months.
“I can’t imagine that the ECB will change its program in a significant way.”
“Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," predicts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the government debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that revives the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the eurozone sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must at all costs take the spotlight on the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way to prevent the precipitous enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states," a major bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates start to rise, states would be even more prevented from reducing their debt or even just stabilizing it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
Berlusconi government covers Italy
After a disturbing start to the week for Italy, the situation has relaxed a little yesterday with the decline of the corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, Giulio Tremonti, the region’s president, had qualified the situation as “uncountable” and heard him expect an “unpredictable” weekend, which he immediately denied.
In any case, on Tuesday, the German interest rate shear would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed “heavily worried” about the “market turbulence” and a potential risk of infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the accompanying, sluggish tax revenues that put the state at risk of failing to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget before the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the riot about a new budget collective, which could be deployed after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
“If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken,” says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, an Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) less stabilization progress is required from Italy than from other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There is still the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of mistrust from the Chamber of Deputies, according to which the early elections could be organized as early as the end of March.
So there is a little favourable period ahead for a decision to be taken regarding a serious crisis.
Europeans are considering the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said in a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think it was proven on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: the Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency territory."
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday in the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments as well as the ECB.
However, there can be no mention of a beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could lower Portugal's debt note, arguably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly burdensome on the banking systems," said the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "the political time is passing much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, who are well aware of both this gap and the danger hidden in it, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal discussions between the finance ministers most directly affected and, in the broader sense, with their G20 counterparts are proceeding well.
And this also in view of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the plan is the lot of the unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the eurozone countries in the crossroads of the markets (see below).
As for the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already begun his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the ground for it.
The EU Stability Fund’s first commercial paper expenditure is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative of the agency entrusted Reuters, the United States supported a possible increase in funds mobilized through the IMF’s additional, direct commitment.
For their part, Portugal and Spain, the countries in the forefront, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms to be added to the austerity measures, but to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have.
Both, at all costs, are about avoiding the need for international assistance before setting up their own budgetary correctives and deciding on inevitable structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long term.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to speed up the normalisation process of government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take back into its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, who are at the forefront of the European public debt market, believe that an extension of €100 billion would suffice, “preferably” in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means exists: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every opportunity to be carefully investigated in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are getting worse.
Snow and smooth ice: 24 departments in alarm level Orange
The snow episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, especially in Brittany’s secondary transport networks, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alarm status Orange due to the imminent risk of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in alarm stage Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers tangent to the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers of 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region are expected.
The regions Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is significant enough to cause traffic impediments and impair certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor region, several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic situation of secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were planned for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires drivers to be extremely cautious on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights from Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly due to expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
The Gatwick airports in southern London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is to be remembered.
In order to start the construction of the SGP, the state has announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to lend a portion of the financial sum to its double in the markets.
Today, we have finally come to the first reckoning.
The supplementary budget for 2010, reviewed this morning by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures planned to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax for the purpose of development and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de-France.
The first, according to article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
“The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year.”
Second is a reorganization of the already existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it to increase the product resulting from it and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not numbered in the text.
Of the 4 billion is far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment raised by the state and gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement is to be seen.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"From the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e.), you can cover the projection over three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be recorded in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that in 2013, the 4 billion for the 2014 budget will be commenced.
This measure, whose 4 billion promised one will be able to look for for a long time, runs the risk of provoking a rather turbulent, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Revengeful hackers and eager spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double significance.
On the one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's move on in turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence service (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what you have been able to read in any x-any journal for months anyway (except for those owned by Berlusconi), and the frighteningly caricatured profile of Gaddafi has offered their cabaret artists for a long time.
The rule that the secret files may only consist of known news is essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosenkreuzlers) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (or because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the mechanism of success of Dan Brown.
The same with the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as the ones Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such an upheaval made about the revelations of these files?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II and since then heads of government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into espionage centers.
Any spectator of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not hypocritical to do so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of publicly repeating it violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-any hacker can unravel the most secretive secrets of the world’s most powerful country bears the significant blow against the prestige of the state deanate.
In addition, the scandal puts the victims less in distress, rather than the "scarfers".
But let’s devote ourselves to the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, you could combine all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have since turned out to be perfectly correct, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the motorway chosen and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
But if you think about what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control process ceases to be unilaterally directed and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker — chosen as the avenger of the citizen — can uncover the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free from secrecy, as it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, it meant to reveal any power that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets.
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this insult that has been inflicted on such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that states will no longer post any reserved information online in the future - that would be like a slope glued to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies it is in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports secret over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see myself forced to imagine the government officials moving in a secret way on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their communications nowhere else than in their mere memory, and moreover, the few written information they have received in the shoe.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, Watergate’s espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology these days is advancing like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph using (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band by band by being able to coil from the back to the front and uncover all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
High-speed trains travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane, including switching.
It is therefore not unusual that politics and communication technology come back to the car and the horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
Currently, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France delivers its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the fast-resolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or early financing) implemented by developing countries.
And the rough French gossip has already been uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged €7.2 billion over three years, while France has pledged €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed progress report of their Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its true value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries doing the same thing at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, which is on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional contribution has been made without going to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what “new and additional” means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonization, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that they think is best.
For example, the European Commission chose itself as the benchmark for 2009: international financing will be maintained and 150 million will be donated for over three years as part of the "fast start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development assistance.
In return, France felt that the financing of "all new projects" of the year 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for previous year’s expenditure or for global public development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France claims to abide by its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule on this yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is difficult: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often related to emission containment projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro received as the equivalent of a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the investor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince yourself of it.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are 100% fulfilling their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet their commitments, France gives just 10 cents and understands a comparable contribution.
Nice hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double scam: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once internally (why do the other member states continue with the donation, if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not let completely deceive...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the overall climate discussions.
But it could be too much of the drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its type of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could carry forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another crucial topic that is currently being discussed): it is not possible to escape the question of "predictability" or the type of accounting for its loans.
France could change its position to be just as progressive on issues of contention as it is with other things.
The hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France's fast-start and its vision of "predictability" and use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes different chemical substances over day 81, according to a study published Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its findings "in view of the small number of samples analyzed do not represent a statistically significant value, but rather represent an illustration character of the treated problem," had between July and September purchased the foods usually consumed within four, from a approximately ten-year-old child to meals plus an intermediate meal at the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – were examined as well as pastries from laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is depleting: 81 chemicals, including 42 potentially or likely carcinogenic and five potentially carcinogenic, as well as 37 endocrine-disrupting substances, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded in the approximate total of cases, it is very well understood from this survey that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptors is alarming," the association notes.
Already at breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly banned in the EU.
In addition, the chopped steak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals were spiced.
In the tap water, the analyses have brought to light the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the "richest", and even the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The ultimate risk of this "polluting cocktail" for the consumer "will likely be underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halt the “increase in civilizational diseases” “in view of the urgency of the situation”.
In July, a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) study identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
