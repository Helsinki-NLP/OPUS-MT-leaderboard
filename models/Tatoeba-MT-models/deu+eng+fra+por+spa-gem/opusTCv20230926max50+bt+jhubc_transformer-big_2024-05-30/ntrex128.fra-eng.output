Members of the Welsh Assembly worried about ‘passing for puppets’
Welsh elected officials were appalled by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposed amendment of the name of the assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of mockery.
One Labour official said his group is concerned that the acronym “rimes with Twp and Pwp.”
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means shit.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be “open” to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet, the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the name change, stated that "the final decision regarding the appointment of the members of the Assembly rests with the latter."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 grants the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the question of the title of members, the Commission is in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Welsh people prefer MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could prove to be a real puzzle for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on the name change in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the name issue during the debate on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
Athens has long insisted that the name of Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly vetoed its neighbouring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said he would not take into account the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: Churches in difficulty, bells of St. Martin silenced
“The elderly people I talked to say that traditionally there was a bar and church on every corner of the street,” Adams says.
“There are none at all today.”
According to him, it is normal that the bars have become scarce.
Today, “we don’t get together in the same way anymore,” he explains.
“We used to go to the bar like we did to his neighbor, but that’s not the case anymore.”
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out long before what the officials imagine and it worries him: "Sooner or later, they will return to the starting point."
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
“The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely white people who will rush the closure of all churches because they are unlikely to become members,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The initial White Methodist congregation abandoned the site in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching around, took possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black community under the leadership of the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, where blacks struggled to get employment or promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new bell.
Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's Church, Rev. David Johnson, proudly called the "poor people's bells."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
It also mentions that it is the world's first bell played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took a seat in front of the larger bell of the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, there has been a lot of talk about the upheaval of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter would impose on it the costs incurred, although it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-Year-Old Man Wounded by Shark at Lobster Fishing Party
Authorities said a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while practicing lobster fishing in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and started paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was shouting joyfully for having had a catch, and then he understood that in reality he
had been bitten.
Arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the collarbone.
“I was screaming for everyone to come out of the water: There’s a shark!” says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of the shark that caused the attack is not known.
In a press conference, Chief Rescuer Larry Giles informed that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed the access from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but that most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's Offensive Plans in the British Aesthetic Market
Sainsbury's hands-down on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and fills them with supermarket-like shelves, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion aesthetics market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home products are falling, more extensive beauty products rays will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experiment proves conclusive.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetics, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also have more space in areas similar to those of boutiques such as Boots.
The supermarket also revives its Shop makeup line to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two stores in Sainsbury's, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second one scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket leaders need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly tending to shop online and head to local grocery stores for everyday food.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, said outlets will look more and more like grocery stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, helped propel sales of everyday consumer goods and make the acquisitions profitable.
Previous attempts at restructuring the UK chain's pharmaceutical and cosmetics shelves had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended after controversy over the distribution of profits from supermarket pharmacies.
After 3 years ago selling its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the pharmaceutical chain Lloyds, the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty rays has been changed to improve the customer environment.
“We also invested in training so that our staff can provide wise advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any type of need and, thanks to the beautification of our shelves and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undisputed and changes buying habits,” added Mills-Hicks.
Angry with Peter Jones after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Angry with Dragon's Den star Peter Jones after announcing the withdrawal of host Holly Willoughby from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract related to her home decor brand, to devote herself to her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to deal with the brand of interior decoration and accessories Truly.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby made Dragon's Den star Peter Jones furious by retiring from their fruitful last-minute textile and interior design business to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the beloved child on TV revealed at a high-voltage meeting at the headquarters of Dragon's Den's commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, would no longer allow him to take care of Truly, their home decor and accessories brand.
The Truly brand was equated with that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the hostess's fortune estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside Britain.
According to a source, “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It is about securing its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone voiceless.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is filled with ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe the departure of the hostess of This Morning, one of Britain’s most “bankable” celebrities, could cause millions to be lost to the company, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
This could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together, and Peter Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and take over from Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity at ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that he did not want to comment on his business.
The debate was heated, but finally we love each other
Trump has mocked the media criticizing him for his comment that some consider “unworthy of a president,” and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He mocked, taking the voice of a TV journalist.
“I didn’t give up anything at all.”
He said that Kim Jong-un was in favour of holding a second meeting after Trump called the first, which took place in Singapore in June, a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denuclearization are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomatic chief Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no “corresponding response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
It regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his rally speech Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“Everything is fine with North Korea,” he said.
We have approached the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile-firing tests, the release of hostages and the remains of North American military returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this bustling arena, there are barely more than 200 people standing in front of me,” he said, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: Devastated island and hundreds dead in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, aid from foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10 per cent of Lombok's population was scattered, but no state of national catastrophe was declared, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
"Unfortunately, many times they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which makes things a little more complicated," Sumbung said.
While the Save the Children organization is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it still does not know if field work will be allowed.
The spokesman for the national disaster management agency, Mr. Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian assistance.
Despite the constant shocks, the country is desperately lacking the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Refuges have been set up in Aceh, but they are scarce in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm siren sounded in Palu, which may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters make the use of transport more difficult.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed decayed infrastructure reform at the centre of his election campaign and has spent considerable sums to restore roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, undermined Joko's government, which is called to stand in front of voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than 1,000 Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes on the back of street clashes between Christians and Muslims armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge wins Equal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a loss to Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led from 1 to 0.
He shot in the ball on his left, before escaping a shot to the second pole.
The ball flew over the repair surface before heading to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended its route at the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to place myself, to grab the ball, but players like Shaq always shoot as far as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching to control and without really much thinking I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker made a pass to Mateo Kovacic, before heading to the midfielder and sprinting on the Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a quick back-and-forth midfield,
then made a magnificent deep shot that led Hazard into the surface.
Hazard passed the defense and ended his race in the net of the second pole, with a left foot shot behind Liverpool goaltender Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitans in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: Tsunami death toll rises to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the death toll of the earthquake and tsunami was 832.
Many residents are trapped beneath the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho spokesman told a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was dotted with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbed woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman stabbed with knives was found on John Street in Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the residents of the neighborhood who have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything of a suspect to contact us.
In particular, I appeal to taxi drivers, who could have captured something on their dashcam and ask them to provide us with any crucial information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found on a property in Birkenhead where she resided.
This morning, people who claimed to know the woman showed up at the scene of the crime and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and the police said they were informing close relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, with police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene,
Repeating, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cord, and another was stationed outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inside of the cord.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact the Crime Failure agency anonymously at 0800 555 111.
The Statue of Cromwell, Last Victim of an Attempt to Rewrite History
Its prohibition would be the rightful return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society deemed Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it a "revisionist attempt."
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that "in view of the current debate around the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's one erected outside the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell did not ordain or conduct iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is probable that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb depiction of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration that one had for him in the nineteenth century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, I mean monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents one side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated.”
China: A pig kills a farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered in blood near a pigyard in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He and his cousin reportedly traveled from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the neighboring pigyard was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and blood flowed from his mouth.
A forensic-legal report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg has mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the breeder’s cousin, said that “his legs were crushed and covered with blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving at the market at 0440 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any further incidents and allow police officers to collect evidence.
The family of rancher Mr. Yuan and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although facts are rare, attacks by pigs against people have already been reported.
In 2016 on a Massachusetts farm, a pig assaulted a wife and her husband, seriously injuring the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kg pig caught a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to drive him away.
In 2012, when an Oregon farmer had just been devoured by his pigs, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that it was not an aggressive animal in principle, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They’re rather playful animals,
Very curious kids... they have no intention of harming.
Just show them the respect they owe them,” he assured.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves above the colder waters of Mexico's northeastern coast.
However, Rosa will cause showers in northeastern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
The winds were blowing at 135 km/h (category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and flows eastward to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula in the form of a storm on Monday, Hurricane Rosa will drive intense tropical humidity northward in the southwestern United States.
It will fall as much as 25 cm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with approaching depression will create widespread torrential rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Rainfall will reach 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwestern regions, including much of Arizona.
Dispersed tropical rains are likely to cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Intense rains could turn canyons into wild rivers and thunderstorms will produce wind gusts and dust whirlwinds in places.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rainfall in some southern parts of the country, on the California coast.
Total rainfall can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
These could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical showers will reach Arizona late in the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall all over the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
This sometimes causes a radical change in time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will face considerable temperature variances on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to experience an early warm October, with temperatures rotating around 26 degrees Celsius covering the southern plains and other regions of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the seasonal average.
Multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first fortnight of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television channels on Thursday, the gripping hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political stalemate persists, broadcasters have halted their usual Friday schedule to announce a coup d'état: an agreement conceived by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
In front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford said she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had touched her and tried to remove her clothes at a high school night.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, claimed to be equally 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures from other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen does not always manage to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
By comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the most watched channel on audition day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC was second with an audience of 3.26 million.
They were followed by CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
Interest did not fade once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office released a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was taken aside by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to the court hearing.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, as CNN broadcast the sequence of the interrogation live.
“Don’t look elsewhere, look at me,” one of the women said.
“Do you really think he’s telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are destitute.”
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office issued a statement and he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast channels were covering the live session a few hours later, as the Judicial Commission was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's appointment by the entire Senate.
Flake, however, indicated that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the charges made against the candidate, as demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by chatting with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after speaking with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
His choice was heavy on the balance, as Republicans would not have actually got the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of doing ‘small politics’
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union, to do “small politics” at the expense of Britain’s future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which posted a photo of Theresa May on the cover, its former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposed free trade between Britain and the European Union was “properly ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, has been stuck and is charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the clash.
Found at the scene, the glasses wore Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton Rouge parish coroner's office on Friday released a preliminary report, which determines that the death was caused by an injury caused by a bullet that crossed the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “commitment and quest for justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “devastated and shocked” after the news of Wayde’s death.
“We fear this kind of event all the time,” Wade said.
Mexico: Volcano spits ash
Ash escaping from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Center recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after recording a spike in activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center monitored several rumblings and tremors from Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 magnitude shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists approaching the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being pushed back by riot police, masked separatists threw them eggs and colorful powder, creating clouds of dust in the streets, which usually do not disassemble tourists.
Squadrons also broke out later in the day, while police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “neither forgetting nor forgiving” faced unionist supporters shouting “Long live Spain.”
14 demonstrators with minor injuries were healed, according to the local press.
One year after the referendum on 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favor of separation, tensions in the independence region remain vibrant.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independence groups had camped Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
This took place anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
“We witnessed a great moment last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in a stalemate.”
Despite their capital, albeit thin, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for organizing the referendum and declaring independence for Catalonia.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the police support demonstration on his phone, said politicians were responsible for blocking the situation on both sides.
“The tension is just rising,” he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in jail awaiting a trial since last year, announced his intention to present his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
“For me, this is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the unleashed repression by the Spanish government,” he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly raiding a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also fired with arrows.
Livingston wins match 1-0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's victory
Recently climbed to the ranks, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games on Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga’s goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt’s team to place themselves in second place in the standings, on equal footing with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of a Premiership away victory this season, and must face the Hearts team, which leads by 8 points on Sunday.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Rapid of Vienna on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
The Livingston team has extended their undefeated career in the division by 6 games, and their head coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, can boast that he has not lost a single game yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity to face blunt opponents
Holt’s team could have gotten a head start well before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to break through but remained stuck in front of the opposing goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a header pass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team allowed the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that it could hinder them with worked tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to catch Menga, who took a touch and scored a midfielder goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves facing an impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half experienced the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's strike, while Lithgow managed to thwart one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston goaltender repelled all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were denied by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation of Glenn Middleton and the other for a mishand.
The Livingston "phenomenon" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland, at Tony Macaroni Arena
Stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this uphill slope.
Their style and team composition have hardly changed since they returned to the top, but much of the merit goes to Holt for having motivated a team since his arrival.
There are many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was great and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their breaths throughout the game.
The Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed a last chance and managed to break through the opposing side only once; this is a warning to the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Mixed welcome of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Various issues were addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
For security reasons, police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering outside the building, while many supporters were able to approach to spot their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to his country.
The split that emerges from the protests reflects this double vision of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and described as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Road Accident: Cyclist Dies in Collision with Car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescue arrived on site, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
London police said officers were making every effort to identify the individual and warn his loved ones.
Roads have been closed and bus detours have been put in place and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in riot
The head of the high-security men's prison said six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at around 9.30 a.m. local time on Sunday and is still not under control.
Specialized anti-riot agents were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
The officers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison management said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons; those responsible will have to respond to police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered to be the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in HM Long Lartin Prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot-fighting officers were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners attacked staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but that is likely to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading for the southwestern desert with what remains of its energy, which could be affected by sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with heraldic rains starting Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have kept the depression or tropical storm stage within a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm in places in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to have 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with isolated total measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa’s rains could be life-saving for drought-affected areas that are not at risk of sudden flooding.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring System, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme-grade drought, the second most severe,” weather.com reports.
Hurricane Rosa begins its way along the coast in the peninsula of Lower California.
Still of great power on Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of rainfall is expected from Lower California northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm,” weather.com said.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, crossing Arizona and southern Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
“Torrent rains are expected in Lower California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert and are the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially fatal sudden floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton, Saturday at around 4 a.m. local time.
He's been sent to the hospital, his condition is stable.
Avon and Sommerset police said they arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) in the night on Radstock's side.
The officers made a call to people who were likely to have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been the victim of Democrats’ wickedness and anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the Democrats’ wickedness and anger throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke to Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally rejecting the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago, as teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” on this day.
“A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service,” he told the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he referred to the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first decisive procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's appointment is scheduled to take place by Friday, according to a Republican party employee's statement to CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds, death toll continues to increase
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had perished, most carried away by huge waves that hit the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu, when six-metre-high waves overwhelmed the beach at dusk, taking many lives and destroying everything along the way.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake preceded the tsunami.
"When the threat of the tsunami arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), told a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it drove cars, pieces of wood, houses, it took everything with it,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster management agency show buildings and stores destroyed, bridges deformed and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographical location, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she said.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped beneath the rubble of ruined buildings, he added, noting that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the human and material losses could be greater on the 300 km coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, the closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were “completely paralyzed” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could well get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not spreading information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although agents said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was released.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man upstairs of a building frantically screaming to passers-by on the street as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water came down on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to deliver aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the evacuees are still in great need of food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has reopened as part of rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia: The death toll of tsunami victims is increasing, with more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where they found refuge in tarpaulin shelters set up in the yard of their offices. Along the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, Doseba explains.
“They told me they saw many homes destroyed,” he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began helping the victims, some complained that experienced foreign aid workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not yet the case.
“This catastrophe is still considered regional,” said Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government declares this to be a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting.”
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday fell on Palu, relatives of the missing people were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days, near her mother's body.
Indonesian paragliding national team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi said.
“As an alumni in the discipline of paragliding, I have experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages remained unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
In Newport on the Levee, thieves steal $26,750 when reloading vending machine
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent charging a vending machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle emptied a distributor in the entertainment complex and was preparing to feed it, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly spotted many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is kindly requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: “Formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used the nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before heading to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his appearance for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current pseudo-professional, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most widely used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only one," to Ye - the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the hyphen and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO says it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire at a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly student allowances and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States is expected to double its funding dedicated to AI research, according to investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made announcements related to AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are ahead of the United States, and we’re looking for the next big AI discovery,” Lee says.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next key step in AI will come from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, then joined the Microsoft Reasearch management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has previously participated in technology competitions hosted by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that appropriates academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited major academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that immigration policy changes could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers,” he says.
China’s State Council unveiled its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve industry and academy partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, meanwhile, is currently investing more than $100 million a year for AI research.
In parallel, U.S. legislation working to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has taken no action in several months.
Macedonians take part in referendum on their country’s name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard in a referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of which is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50% participation required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: “Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which has survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. This means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the voter turnout was only 16%, when it reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which mobilized 66% of voters registered after the election.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the name change, in order to open the voice for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter it through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
“I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after dropping his ballot.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll released Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected turnout rate.
Another survey, organized by Macedonian channel Telma, estimated the participation at 57%.
70% of participants who intended to vote said they would vote “yes”.
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50% of the votes plus one vote are required.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton’s defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 game on Saturday at Manchester’s Etihad Stadium.
Aguero’s goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the easiest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine goalkeeper received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed one defender before evicting the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English frontman took the opportunity to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton goaltender Mathew Ryan with a shot from the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” team coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial advantage in the Premier League game,
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton field.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before sliding off the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer Wants to Play Troubleshooting Against the Rockies
As the Nationals were eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to embark on a new game.
But the very competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only in the event of a playoff for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Even if this game isn’t at stake, we want to step on the field in Denver, with that atmosphere, with the crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level I’ll have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a launcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave room for Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual rest day, Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with an average earned points of 2.53 and 300 withdrawals on catches in 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's Interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation generated by his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s a major issue. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see it over the last four days,” he added, before calling Democrats “angry, wicked, and lying.”
He spoke to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which resulted in him being scorned by the public.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Have you disclosed the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm expecting one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the large community it was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from the Momentum movement in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour parliamentarians who are considered not welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
As for me, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
Notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said: “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
That is exactly what the Friday night general assemblies were during my eight years as a Labour parliamentary.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many rallies and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into account.
It has become clear that opposing opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy took power, and colleagues with whom I thought I would share the same political vision began to expect me to turn my jacket around and take positions contrary to my beliefs, whether it was about national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive tirade on social media, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be a party member.
And that's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me were of a political nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a splash of sexist or racist comments every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current policy is the standardization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is restricted by motions of mistrust and changes to the rules of selection.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the past two years: lower my eyes, don’t express my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But this is not how I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the neglect of Thatcher’s government had caused the collapse of my classroom, and since then I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or minister of government.
I have never concealed my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and by my differences with the current party officials.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is going towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and utilities. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes I stand for, which are your interests at all.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament for the riding of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains undefeated
Two late trials may have distorted the final result, but no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day game of the Scottish Rugby Championship in XV.
The team now occupies the top of the standings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized of the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can welcome this game.
“So far, we have been tested, but we remain undefeated, so I have to feel happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie congratulated Ayr: “Congratulations to them, they have been more effective than us and have been able to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish squad Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to get the numbers to speak.
Climo made the situation worse for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the half. He scored and turned a solo trial to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher. During the recovery, Ayr took the lead with a trial of Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried her luck with an untransformed essay by Bruce Colvine, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team got back in hand and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for hitting Climo while he didn't have the ball, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's jaw, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the test, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe assembled David Armstrong's box kick and sent wingman Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth home test.
Still Game star launches into catering
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in catering, and the actor was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC’s famous show, which he writes and co-hosts with his longtime partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series coming up will be the finale of the show. And Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "blooming restaurant environment."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol in an armored boat in the La Paz naval headquarters.
Public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: "The sea is right back to us.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout blocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still present, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades: Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen across the country, hoping that the Hague court will vote in favour of the Bolivian request. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement on a sovereign ocean crossing to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has much to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will rule in favor of Chile, and that little will change, even if a positive decision is made.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the latest arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have even hurt it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined all the Chilean goodwill that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very complicated to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision-making was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales — who remains to date one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get rid of the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would not give up nuclear weapons until it trusted Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to relaunch nuclear diplomacy in the stalemate more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri says it is “chimerical” to think that maintaining sanctions and opposing a declaration that will end the Korean War will bend the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of significant prior disarmament measures from Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness about renouncing an arsenal that the country sees as the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in head covers, which may soon be available in your stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun 100%, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of delusional oversize hats during a PE19 parade that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
All more extravagant hats than each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delusional pieces into the parades.
Valentino's flagship piece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a wide edge evoking a feather, which swallowed the mannequins' heads.
The other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but these pieces weren't designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had sewn lips and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment, with snorkel and glasses, while another resembled a molten ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you are lucky.
According to the style observers, the imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow in the footsteps of the "Bomba", the wide-board straw hat that stars tear off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that marketed this hard-to-wear hat that flooded social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in a swimsuit that wore it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, adorned with rafia fringes and a handful of white leather, was the centerpiece of Jacquemus’s PE19 La Riviera show at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in stores for next summer. The designer has marked the minds so much that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made curriculum, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries.
If you look at the excellent exam results this year, you can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade, A.
Data collected from the 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils scored highest, A in Mandarin, as did the 72% of pupils who studied German, 69% of pupils who studied French and 63% of pupils who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and youth in the future.
Languages as subjects are now organized as are science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that among employers’ difficulties in recruiting candidates, 17% are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job vacancies requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of their career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from this lasting skill in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of their competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them did not have enough foreign language skills to conduct a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those in emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the run-up to 2020, including Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
It is clear that, at present, in a global trading environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make his Lakers debut Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans awaiting LeBron James' debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' coach, announced that James would play Sunday, at the pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still don’t know how many minutes he’ll play.
"More than one, less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a limited few minutes.
After training, earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need any pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump's Campaign in West Virginia (YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stopovers, including in states like Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the vote to confirm the vacancy in the Supreme Court being postponed, Trump seeks to gather support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to be 7:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow him online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of the hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed up to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans gain ground ahead of the November elections.
According to Reuters, the U.S. president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of Congress is such an essential part of his program that the president will visit as many states as possible at the start of a busy election campaign,” a Trump team spokesman told Reuters, who refused to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight’s meeting, scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of Pittsburgh media.”
On Saturday, it will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try and relaunch him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team is ready to fight to keep hope in the approach of Sunday singles
After three singles, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon might well represent what was missing in this Ryder Cup.
The momentum swing movement is a sports concept invented from the ground up but that players believe in sincerely, and more than ever in tournaments such as this one.
So where would they place the momentum now?
“They were leading six points ahead and now four, so it gives us a little bit of wings,” Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a little bit windy and have every reason to be encouraged, including Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can boast of scoring three out of four points each.
Spieth proved terribly effective from tee to green and sets an example.
The energetic shouts of joy intensified as his game progressed; a crucial putt allowed him to equalize in the fourth half as Thomas and he were led two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game at the 15th hole, sparked a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team is still in the race.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the Ryder Cup history attests.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four games out of four and has no right to make a mistake.
Not only were "Moliwood" the only ones not making a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the delusional crowd, designate them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European victory as the sun sets on the National Golf.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated morning's fourball hero Sergio Garcia while teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, no one is there to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give and the ones they don’t give, and how a strategy can flip at a glance.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a tremendous lead over the last day, but this foursome session also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially at home.
Europe lead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a solid advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning it 10-6 over the United States in Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a distressed Tiger Woods, which allowed them to score four points so far.
Determined to keep the title she lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn’s European team made the difference by beating 3-1 in the morning fourballs against a messy American team.
The United States demonstrated greater resistance in the foursomes and won two victories, but failed to bridge the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must score eight points out of 12 on Sunday's singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, dubbed "Molliwood" after a crashing weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they flattened the pair consisting of the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself during Saturday's two games, has shone a few times, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning a 2-1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world leaderboard.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, in a cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 win against Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered by a gap of four points in singles, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, had to play a draw to retain their trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they might not recover from a Sunday counterattack.
North Korea says disarmament will “in no case” be unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions reinforced his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the world body's annual general meeting, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we don’t see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and in such circumstances it is excluded that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While reiterating North Korea’s well-known criticism of Washington’s opposition to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization whereby North Korea would be rewarded if it gradually took action, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the first ever summit between a U.S. President-in-Office and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work for “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea seeks to formally end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also rejected demands to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and increase pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing “the declaration of the end of war”.
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us go down don’t know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust.”
No comment was made on the second Kim-Trump summit highlighted before the United Nations by the US leader earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the side concerned with the issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a deadlock.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korean missiles on North American territory after President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened last year before the United Nations to “totally destroy” North Korea, did not fail to praise this year for the courage with which Kim has applied disarmament measures, but added that much remains to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
“It can take two years, three years, or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until complete, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim is demanding the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University has put in place a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fights the growing macho tendency of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
A professor has noticed that most students at the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him
In the end, a student approached me and said, "Why is this only told to me in the last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
First delivered this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of health services at the university, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of various interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing various objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical benefits and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not instantly change the behavior of students.
However, in our view, they have a right to know that information – in the same way that you have a right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the pride culture of “spending a night off” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having adequate, good-quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid gaining weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and urged him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar curriculum before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm for both bedtime and waking time, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal brings down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another hard blow on the outside, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 loss in Livingston.
The Ibrox team hoped to record their first moving win since their 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team inflicted on Gerrard their second 18-game loss as a coach, leaving his team drifting, eight points behind the Ladbroke Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-time and the Rangers team, running out of inspiration, failed to equalize.
With the Rangers now falling to sixth place, Livingston rose to third place, just behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, with referee Calum Spence having to be treated for a head injury following the throwing of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, meanwhile, chose the same Livi 11 who snatched a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team stifle his opponents every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston has done more.
They should have scored two minutes, when Menga’s first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor’s goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful blow towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow only managed to reach the second pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received a penalty after the free-kick when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only took advantage of two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a hit by Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it by their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to face Jacobs’s halted kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard reacted in the half by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange nearly had an immediate impact when the wingman showed up in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to make a block.
Livingston continued to push visitors to play exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the last few moments, but McGregor did well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton once again claimed a late-game penalty while battling Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now, a page of our almanac "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOUR Counter... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: “What is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, we use it to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Thanks to these headphones, one can actually hear the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “Tell me, it’s sure to jump here!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells and kill them
As part of treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose purpose is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the protein HER2 “induces an increase in several types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, taking immune cells to “learn” how to target cancer cells, has proven itself as part of the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Dressed in a MAGA cap, Kanye West embarked on a Pro-Trump tribe after moving to the SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West screamed on the set after a rash performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced he would run for election in 2020.
After his third track, Ghost Town, which he sang while wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump? He’s a racist!’
“Well, if racism had worried me, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock was making fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that cap on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I’m in a pit,” he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the abyss?” and said that he would wear his superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions to him. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love.”
His comments drew hums at least twice from the public and members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. One person on the spot told the magazine: "A deadly silence fell on the entire set."
West had been called to replace at the last minute the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West upset a lot of people by singing the song I Love It in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of Conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR HAVE HEADED AT THE FUEL.”
But Karen Hunter, the show’s host, tweeted that West was simply “loyal to himself, and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes, or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out an ideology harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and followed in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion and of course the legendary late Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: indictment of attempted murder after gun attack in a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear Monday in the Belfast Court of First Instance.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, tackles toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his fine-blade role, Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that this kind of role on screen often leads young boys to pretend to be hard-to-bake to get respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he said “something is wrong” and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he was “strongly” on the issue.
“Personally, I deeply believe that we have abused masculinity.”
“What lessons have we taught young men who are becoming adults, in relation to the problem that now arises?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been instilled?
What does television and the street teach young boys to think they have to behave like this to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There is obviously something wrong.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, claiming that it ended with "the battlefields and the horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in a cover of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was for him the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie’s family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients have been contaminated during sex, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly to parts of the country following transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protections.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee leaked senator data, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia's legislature pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were backed by experts and “right-wing” websites.
“Lies, lies, and still infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It appears that the information leaked included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted Thursday by an unknown at Capitol Hill during the Senate session on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and leaked the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leak of that information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a real lie.”
The Waters statement promptly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press attaché.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something they have not done, they should not be angry.
It should not be provocative.
It must not question the motives of the accuser.
She must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters’ seat in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the relevant law enforcement authorities and services” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are unmasked,” she added, “and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team.”
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, ungifted spy
It has now become a tradition to look for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent the new export opportunity of our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his ruffled eyes and rubber face, has seen his license renewed for the second time in a confusing context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking cinematographic audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts as a glamorous charmer, possesses a bit of Clouseau, a hint of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the guy who executes a small note in The Fire Trolleys at the 2012 London Olympic Opening Ceremony.
Originally, he was also inspired by the traveler and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has a nice moment or two.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades were hitting his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission Impossible compose themselves confidently with comedy.
Humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented, and to me Johnny English’s wild misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson’s silent movie gags in Bean’s character.
The perpetual premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all the British agents on the ground, to the dismay of the agents on duty - a role unfortunately of small scale for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the brink of crisis and already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to get under the tooth in the script.
Its intelligence advisers inform that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means that one has to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a teacher, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: a few nice jokes here, because English offers a Rock Academy-style espionage academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-haul partner, once again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who create big trouble to Her Majesty's secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the grip of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of crazy jokes: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a vibrant French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking on Volta’s luxurious sailboat; and English triggers a real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to familiarize himself with the interior of the house’s Theft.
All stops are insured for this last sequence, but despite all, there are a lot of things for the kids in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t help but think, as with the other Johnny English films: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it has developed a plan for the British to work for four days but that they are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must look at a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week – but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while still receiving the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party’s economic agenda and plans to orient the country in favor of workers.
The shift to a four-day week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.”
“This will not be done in one night, but a four-day working week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers and with its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour conference to give details on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "beneficiaries" in public-purpose businesses.
The alternate Chancellor's plans also provide that current shareholders of water companies may not recover their full stake since the Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into corporate boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who will receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy have told "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court has been postponed by at least one week following the FBI's investigation into the charges brought against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview released on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the 60 Minutes program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“As I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, “Did you do this?”
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
However, Graham’s vote seems engraved in stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she named couldn’t verify it.
This is a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of stars and invested with an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park’s Great Lawn to not only take advantage of the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, whose first edition took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling, or making any other useful effort to raise awareness of poverty reduction.
But to what extent can Global Citizen still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clickitivism” – a situation where people really think they make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “shares” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped inspire world leaders to make commitments and adopt policies worth more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have pledged to “help children develop their full potential,” while promising <0xC2><0xA3>35 million in aid to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition ambassador, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions to ask the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, “what makes you think it’s possible to end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said: “The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists that will perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
U.S. could call on the Navy to create a “blockade” to stop Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can “if necessary” call on the U.S. Navy, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke said Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East with the aim of negotiating energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern center of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
“The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct in order to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,” he added.
Zinke was addressing attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “spokesman for energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia, saying that it has “more than one rope to its bow” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration pledged to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the “inappropriate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a September speech in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said “I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The U.S. position has led to negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to be involved in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to seriously consider running for the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider running for the presidential election following the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider submitting my candidacy to the presidential election.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m so worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters are not of the opinion that she is expected to run in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found that former governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other prominent Democrats named for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin discusses Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son feels right now, what he feels when he comes home, I can connect him to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers come with,” she told the public at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a “taboo subject” and said of his son and other veterans that “they come back a little differently, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and air force members, and every other military, have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police service, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a drunken gun.
18 States and the District of Columbia support a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a memorandum in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, said Friday in a statement that the new policy “ignored decades of state, federal and international law.”
"Federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined based on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the memoir that the policy of denial of entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on grounds of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political convictions,” Sessions said in his announcement of the policy.
“Asylum has never been designed to mitigate all the problems — even the most serious — that people face every day around the world.”
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, at an evacuation center in the empty city.
“At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents have been seen walking into their destroyed homes, picking up moistened goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to strong persistent replications.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to escape.
I was crushed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, saying his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but after the silence.
I don’t know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of “bullying” through “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper spent a four-page advertisement touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the U.S. parliamentary election on November 6, an accusation China refutes.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to meddle in the U.S. election, Trump marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the outset of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, at the Beijing press desk, you will find few protesting voices and you will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on China’s troubling economic trajectory, as the media firmly obey the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers has avoided publishing” his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating female voters in midterm elections due to Kavanaugh’s debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The feelings surrounding this affair have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they want the vote to take place.
In a September 29 article in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, said “we can’t go back.”
Reeher added that he doubted that last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI investigation were enough to calm voter anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters sang “November is coming!” in the Senate corridor as Republicans governing the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be overwhelming,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But that could be even higher, especially among suburban voters and young voters aged 18-29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction would be vivid if Republicans pushed forward confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week that “it has become a confusing mess for the GOP.”
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, it’s not about the appointment of Kavanaugh, it’s about how Republicans handled the situation and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, told the newspaper.
Following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, Americans seem to be divided over the credibility of both sides, with a small majority leaning on his side.
A new YouGov poll found that 41% of people surveyed believed Ford’s testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s free Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as who is authorized to access such or such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that Inrupt was aimed at “dominating the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available at the same time in a single browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility via data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company brings the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working under contract on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not yet in discussions with “Facebook and Google” about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely upset in an instant.
“We don’t ask them for permission.”
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem with the aim of protecting the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a First World War clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on 29 September 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploit.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent fire of field guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the firing line and, with the "greatest bravery", guided the line before blowing up a field cannon alone and slaying three detachment soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “one thing that I will never be up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also dropped a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be part of the show" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent all night watching a full Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 matches, including six on the main sheet, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to compete, viewers in the UK were shocked when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were displeased to have stayed awake until the early hours of the morning, especially for combat.
A supporter on Twitter described the move to the children’s cartoon as “a kind of bad joke.”
Concerning the broadcast, Bellator’s Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications Dave Schwartz said, “The government regulations stipulate that at 6 a.m., this content wasn’t tailored, so they had to switch to children’s broadcasts.”
"Peppa the pig, oui."
Scott Coker, president of the company Bellator, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we cannot find a solution until Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren’t all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We’ll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to give more to the fans and we’ve ruined everything.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' in Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it has instilled the motivation for him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before going to high school that “not everyone [was] like me.”
As part of Lauren Laverne’s first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show, he said he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual host of the show, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of her illness.
Appearing as a shipwreck on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" all other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, “Today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was expressing himself because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and thus wanted to give “hope” back to others.
The triple world champion said he was "not expecting" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married last year the 20-year-old Oscar winner, his eldest, but he said age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he says it was difficult to find a person of the same age who experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole perspective" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, I was just thinking about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“There are things that are more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not agreed that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they already had their tickets to London 2012, since he wanted to be seated in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be there to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and he died for me to finally recognize that he was not invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“That’s all I’ve dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there’s nothing better,” he said.
In addition, it inspired her first choice of song - Heather Small's Proud - that had accompanied her in preparations for the Olympics and always gave her the goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to straighten up to prevent it from being an unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biennial competition for the twelfth time, a record, was dropped by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has so often been for the U.S., the five-time great champion shared his day between supporting the role and fine-tuning his game at the stand in order to remedy his ailments.
He has never been the greatest leader, even at the peak of his career. At 48, he is not the best fit for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the missed shots.
And as if the course wasn’t formidable enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood this week to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12 singles games, make a good start, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn’t say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a slap in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has great confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him playing two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven demises, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room.”
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun competing with him this week, which was fun to see.
He does more than just play.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a not insignificant advance before the singles of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
The Dane played his first game in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep remembering that we were leading largely to Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we failed, as well as at Valderrama, where we won, but close,” said Bjorn, after watching the 2018 Leaderboard win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at Golf National to lead 10-6.
“History will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go all the way tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, that is to try to win this trophy, and that is what we have to stay focused on.
I’ve always said I’m focusing on the 12 players in our camp, but we’re very aware of what’s going on on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a challenging golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never move on to this point.
Tomorrow is another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it will be the individual performances that will be presented and it is quite different.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re put to the test to your full capacity as a golfer.
That’s the message for players to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to go get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players get better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of these last-day turns, after being part of the winning team at Brookline before losing after the "Miracle of Medina", where Europe snatched the victory.
“I remember every word,” he explained in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, did to rally his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on midfield matches.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should do, we try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole course,” Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential expenses.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the new frigates of Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrisome issues that arose after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as a radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside of home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that avant-garde warships - which should allow Germany to project its force overseas - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for the return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and hardware defects” that made the warship useless in case of deployment on combat missions.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the vessel is considerably overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton “Rheinland-Pfalz” weighs twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the price of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared to 2.2 billion at the beginning.
The problems of the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence commission, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is actually “out of ships capable of deploying.”
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland study will follow common pipistrels and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Garden, Wester Ross.
Special registration devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using handheld detectors.
Professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat screams and the activities of different species.
A map and habitat report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of grasslands and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects perches and leads to the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-killing papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles on their flight route.
In charge of protecting more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave site in Dumfries-et-Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, manager of the domain, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great place for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there’s still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before proceeding to the maintenance of properties, because by unintentionally destroying a single maternity nest, one can thus cause the death of 400 females and young, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their poles.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as for many of our species, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations right now.”
Ronaldo refutes rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him “false information,” and claimed that people “want to make themselves known” using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep silent about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, just hours after the allegations aired, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the information “false news.”
“No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to get advertised using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they called “inadmissible denunciation of privacy suspicions.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount proportional to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape allegedly occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County Courthouse, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a "good guy" at "99%" but that he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that they had consented to it.
Mayorga also said she went to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to amicable settlement because she felt “terrified of reprisals” and feared “public humiliation.”
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel this regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged assault, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve under a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: The UK would “regret forever” the departure of automakers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Commerce, the UK would “regret it forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in automobile manufacturing after Brexit.
He added that it was “worrisome” that Toyota UK told the BBC it would temporarily shut down production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what automakers call risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated in a “stretched flow”, parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border that industry said could lead to delays and coin shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid border controls.”
"We want to have the best deal that, as I said, will allow us not only to take advantage of the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said on the BBC's Radio 4's Today show.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent set of supply chains.”
While Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be shut down, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the unite union coordinator at the plant and who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said his members were increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never return.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a clear and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
White House Announces Trump and Rosenstein Meeting Could Still Be Delayed
According to the White House’s announcement on Sunday, the meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “released by a week,” as the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special advisor charged with investigating Russian interference in elections, ties between Trump’s collaborators and Russia, and possible impediments to justice by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone in order to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he showed up in the White House, as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Commission hearing before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the complaints filed against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we can postpone another week given all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press up to date.”
The claim would be contested by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conference at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of the conferences was not due to an aversion to the "demagogic" television reporters, although she said: "I have nothing against the fact that they amaze the gallery."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing any evidence, she added that “the president participates in more Q&A sessions than any other president before him”: “We checked the numbers.”
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to directly question the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it frequently, you’ve seen it well in recent weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare for him to hold solo press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and sometimes a bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
On Brexit fears, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to stay in post after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to result in decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ of Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers' second, was operated on after a head injury on Saturday in the Vanderbilt Commodores' defeat 31-27.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury had occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the touch line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a stretcher and taking it to another exam.
A Tennessee state representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris said there were "no details yet about the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athlete, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five beatings in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 beatings.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp fee if they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees if they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative regimes.
This move will cancel the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the stamp fee will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will be used to strengthen the government's efforts to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which adds to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and lease purchases - could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of new London buildings are purchased by non-residents in the UK, raising prices and preventing first-time buyers from gaining a spot in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp fee to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing major construction companies of keeping real estate prices at a high level by seizing land without using it, he urged May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the “real estate disgrace” that is plaguing the UK.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the elimination of "guilty-free" evictions.
It also wants to give councils broader powers to build new housing.
May said: “Last year, I said I would dedicate my post as prime minister to the rebirth of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the UK, as it is for foreign companies, to buy a home as it is for hard-working British residents.
For far too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become distant and the misery of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland technician Jack Ross explains that his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is delighted to take on the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which currently occupies third place in the Ligue 1, three-point leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up following Scotland’s matches at Hampden with my father and that’s something I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would only arise if I succeed in the club’s stewardship.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's coaches are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic technician says he has not hesitated to stand behind such iconic names in such a big club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I probably would only consider myself a success here if I managed to bring the club back there.”
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa climb up from a relegation to the third division and transformed St Mirren, who was on the brink of relegation, into a major championship winner the following season.
Ross felt more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Alloa's takeover "was probably a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I really felt that being a coach was better for me than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, earned my life well and enjoyed some appreciable peaks.
Sometimes playing is difficult.
There are a lot of details to settle every week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is very good for me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been in my entire adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The heat wave of the summer has driven revenues from struggling British pubs up, but has heightened the pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that bar and pub groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8.
Peter Martin of CGA’s consulting firm, which compiled the data, said: “The permanent sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected World Cup participation meant that July followed the June model, where bars had risen by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants, which suffered an even greater shock.
The decline of 1.8% in June in the catering sector only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most fashionable, with more points of resemblance than restaurants that are down.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.”
Recreational and Hospitality Analyst Paul Newman, RSM, said: "These results follow the trend seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a 4.8 per cent decline in sales on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long, warm summer could not have been less opportune for food operators and weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-deserved respite.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the downturn in the establishment.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined sales of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion Sterling and is the established industry standard.
On social media, one in five children have secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in “fake Insta” pages
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they had a “primary” account to show their parents
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake Insta accounts” — a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a “primary” account cleaned to show it to their parents, while still having a private account.
A mother who accidentally stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who was inciting others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11- to 18-year-olds have a dual profile, with half of students admitting to having private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent athletes on the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as a great opportunity for the sport’s leaders to leverage his vast international experience over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from his participation in the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 200m and 400m at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors stated that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a tough job, but I recovered completely, I relearned walking and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Online, a breast pump ad that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertisement from a company offering a breast pump compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during milking.
To mark the launch of what’s called the “first silent breast pump in the world,” Elvie, a consumer tech company, launched an audacious ad inspired by a music video to showcase the freedom her new breast pump offers breastfeeding women.
In a cow barn filled with hay, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I betray myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “In case you didn’t notice it, it’s my breasts, not my nipples.”
The chorus continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women running the milk.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of which say it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
"It's a poor decision than to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them within the days of their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “This is an understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their baby?”
Someone else added: “An advertisement so disconnected.”
Others have defended advertising, for example a woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious".
“I think it’s an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pomper made me feel like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a fun ad for moms who pump their milk (often in their workplace or toilet) and feel like ‘cows.’
It is not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal dancing with the discreet breast pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, without wires or pipes, and inserts discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pumping their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast milk extraction and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new breastfeeding will provide.
This isn't the first time that the breastfeeder Elvie has been on the front page of the newspapers.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children settled silently in Texas border camp
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply despite the fact that the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly due to the Trump administration’s harsh speeches and policies that have made it difficult to place children in respondents’ homes.
Traditionally, most of the respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared that they would compromise their own chances of staying in the country by carrying themselves to the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their households should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Service official, testified in Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no judicial history.
“Almost 80% of people who are respondents or family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal with children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was previously the norm.
Many of them will appear via videoconference, rather than in person, to plead their case with respect to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed ineligible will be expelled quickly.
According to speakers and reports submitted by the shelter network in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to bursts of violence or attempted escape.
In a large facility like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be neglected due to their size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to camp without giving them time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate trauma that many have a hard time dealing with.
Syria calls on the U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they “would be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” from both terrorist groups and from any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of which train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-ravaged country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on site.
Moualem said about the refugees that conditions were favorable for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "propagating irrational worries" that deterred the refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union said there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement was reached between Assad and the opposition to end this war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress in Idlib has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided “specified deadlines” and expressed hope that the military measures would target jihadists, especially Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to al-Qaeda and who “will be eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations representative, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the group’s work should be limited “to the revision of the articles of the current constitution,” and formulated a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are no doubt hoping, impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
Which would probably be “the most spectacular final of a presidency!”
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour odds have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have virtually tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in high-speed hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers on high-speed nights, is the first cable TV channel.
“It’s a matter that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, a host of the ABC drama series “Designated Survivor” who talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Irrefutable Truths About Slicing into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory for his part.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He replied, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Of course, unlike anything on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of experts debate how Bob Woodward used “deep know-how” for his book “Fear,” on Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment filled with pride,” according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of the extra descriptions.
I’ll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“If part of what he does feels like seeing a reality show, it’s because he makes you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s changing teams and daily turnarounds (fighting with the NFL, congratulations Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode or we're lagging behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at home on the north shore of Kauai, but he landed inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand apart, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the days when we were animating all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside invades the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district was flooded with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of the constituencies of Congress that allowed two incumbents to compete for the same seat.
This recently restructured suburb of Pittsburgh is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which heavily overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former boroughs were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district kicked off a clash over election campaign funding between the major branches of party funding, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory last March in a very popular special election in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political scientists gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then retreated
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington little opposed.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to convene heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions have only been foreseen against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide developmental and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from traveling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending all sanctions considerations against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now hearing speeches at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton in the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the guise of anonymity.
Their remarks were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying History
The next tile could be special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible impediment to justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation to the question of a collusion of Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body, as he prepares to stand in front of voters and, perhaps, to a peer-to-peer jury.
These are many “ifs,” and I do not pretend that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these divides and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these divides.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since the newspaper reported that last year it proposed to secretly record the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we do if the FBI’s recent investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial – or if it is confined to the Supreme Court despite sexual assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And most of all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, which in the past occupied my ambassador’s residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table bearing the swastika.
With this heritage in legacy, I can’t help but be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienne
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienne on Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first appearance of the season until the 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the most of such a result to accomplish exploits.
“It was a positive thing for us, because Villarreal is a quality team,” said the 31-year-old striker.
“We went into the game thinking we could get something and we left with a point.
We might have won in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they made a good result in their last game, nevertheless I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
“Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Hopefully we can move forward now, leave last season behind and triumph.”
Women no longer sleep due to fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people discussed the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they told their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do what it takes to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with redemption value to help you cover those expenses, or other insurance on your assets - provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in passing.
Provide a health care power of attorney that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay your bills if you are incapacitated.
Think of the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is going to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put that plan in place.”
A man was repeatedly injured with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle as he walked back from an evening.
The forty-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which occurred around 2.30 a.m. BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see her assailant.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police issued a call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to increase.
As communications were paralyzed, rescue services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, particularly the Donggala Coastal Region.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis on several occasions for a century, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of residences in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on December 26 on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 reached southern Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 rocked the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 devastated one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes shook the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, contravening a report of domestic violence and resistant to arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone of a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention in Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is being held on unsecured bail of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, pleading "not guilty, for sure" when he was asked to plead, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and is fined $250,000.
He was also charged with committing a minor class B offence, punishable by a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is under way in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, meddling in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His wife said he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior with PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as the tsunami unleashed on the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Claim Rare Death Penalty for Person Suspected of New York Terrorist Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged assailant in New York who has killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been applied in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a truck hired from Home Depot to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing on his pedestrian and cyclist road last October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will need to provide evidence that Saipov “intentionally” assassinated the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the assault, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “meticulous preparation and premeditation,” prosecutors said, calling the method used by Saipov “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not called for the death penalty in the course of prosecutions for ten years.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for committing acts of conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has demonstrated an absence of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities he was prompted to commit the attack after watching Daesh videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the Daesh flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” with the decision to bring prosecutions.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilt and sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to “mobilize the People’s Army” at a protest at the Conservatives Conference.
The former UK Independence Party leader said politicians should “feel pressure” from Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested, he should be tasked with negotiating with the EU.
Back-ban Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK “would already have been released” if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma Ms. May faces in reconciling her deeply divided troops has been underscored by Conservatives in favor of the idea of staying in the Union who have joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its agenda and "chaos".
Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of Chequers.”
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and been entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out already,” he said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We did not engage in world wars to submit.
We want to make our own legislation in our own homeland.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely wrong.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who was in favour of the exit, was also present at the march to tell journalists: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is also the case of our party and our activists who walk the streets and make us elect first.
Give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians should be led to “feel pressure” if they were about to betray the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to deceive Brexit and we’re telling them today: “We’re not going to let you get out of it like this.”
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I wish you felt the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has allowed us to win the Brexit and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, pro-European followers marched through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of activists waved banners from Conservatives against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over security issues regarding party enforcement at the start of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a real farce.
A good Brexit doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider running for presidential election
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for the presidential election after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a GOP representative in the states, who was co-chair in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been at the center of speculation that it could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, which involves having a woman in charge of the state."
Arrest during the shooting death of Sims from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying a man on the images.
Sims, 20, was shot dead on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims received a bullet wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 sports outlets on Saturday.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
When asked, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene, in possession of a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the police service of East Baton Rouge Parish.
Sims, a 2m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 as a starter last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads to the world title after the team’s directions allowed him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified by beating Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team’s directions would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas took a good start and approached Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to throw himself into the turmoil at the tail of the peloton, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the stands a lap later and ended up behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside at the risk of resisting after a double defense attempt in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left the last row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first lap to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a quick finish and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally reached the stalls in the 44th round, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team did an exceptional job of getting a two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who pointed out that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly evoke Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but argued that the events in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest."
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s happening these last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“When they see the disclosures and the leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak any information?
Remember his answer... did you leak information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I have not disclosed anything.”
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak information... No, we didn't leak information," he added, thinking of the senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter from Ford last July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I did not conceal Dr. Ford’s allegations, I did not disclose his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to.”
But his denial doesn’t seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: “I’m going to tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the pettiness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars cleared their defeat Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return game at Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score thanks to two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before Dwyer gave the Giants back the lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, guaranteeing them victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast after being caught.
It was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two sides, with the Giants having triumphed in the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt took over to serve Cownie at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team got together and Bouchard evened again with a goal giving a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half, ensuring his team's victory by scoring a fifth goal in the midfield.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller has died helping hundreds of people on board an aircraft escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died making sure an airplane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the area and a large number of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues’ flight, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his post in the violently shaken tower at Palu’s Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained on site to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the move could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our heart is broken to learn this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, the country's disaster prevention agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance would continue to increase because many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
Waves of up to six meters have ravaged Palu, who will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “At every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” CNN said.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a man has disappeared after a plane crashed in the lagoon.
The airline that managed the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims a man is missing, after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the plane that went down.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it has not been able to trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific passenger information, such as age or nationality.
Local boats participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others could have slipped into the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
l claimed that the flight attendants had panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that sailors working nearby to improve a dock had also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people on land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned his case on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to track the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones indicating that Tellis e found with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “[lying] because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ SMS, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He erased her from her life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to take place in front of the jury in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by impregnating its music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social issues.
The group wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing after 'racist' text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message sent in error from the mother who complained that she was “yet a black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, and equates the prosecution to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON ONE BLACK YET,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Yet instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her "uneasy" look, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, explaining that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Maurice was paid for a day of work and then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Mauritius is suing the couple for compensation for their removal and is claiming $350 a day for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do that sort of thing,” she told the Post Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing that she would not be able to trust him after harming him.
“My wife had sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person with whom you were rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Plasco said his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
“Would you be chasing someone like that?
It’s not a very nice thing to do,” added the business banker.
While the case is still pending, the public opinion court did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington Publishers Worried Readers Could Not Identify With A Talking Bear, New Letter Unveils
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s tremendous success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a little teddy bear, remained optimistic about the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication had had a "sweet-bitter" flavor after her death last year.
She described Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” adding that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a pretty calm man, and he wasn’t a pretentious man,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a successful child: we’re proud of him, even if it’s not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter had been taken urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad was calling regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect her to get away with it," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines doctors had given him to maintain his heart rate were slowly depleting and getting out of his system.
She had died a while before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was unfolding.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep up.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the trial she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women drop postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a Welsh bridge containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any room.”
However, he quit his job before dying, since he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s then 11-year-old brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go see and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt down, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything.”
She said her death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to get away with it: “It’s heartbreaking for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to move forward and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for — a time-limited investigation, limited in scope — we might be able to bring a bit of unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “collapse” into a partisan impasse.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, that is, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans score a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who at the time was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to split the vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of deserters 'fall' under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions took place last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said strengthened border controls between North Korea and China and increased tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of deserters in the North will ultimately be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of talks centered on the denuclearization negotiations that had been pending until then.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly speaking, to work towards a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we will be the first to operate unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and claims he is unfit to sit on the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, they would have called her "hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied, emotionally, allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes nearly screamed and choked about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations about him a “grotesque and coordinated assassination” organized by disappointed Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she said Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, since he showed he was against the Democrats.
“I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he dealt with Clinton and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to oust Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he’s also unfit to sit in the court where he currently sits,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a Conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh avoided the question of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t it wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and it can't get her out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, what about you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who told me she was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to say to the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried, ‘You can think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with inexpressible rage, was that I was seized by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who was always a little terrified of me - who dragged me down a staircase.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they're delighted because they've got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic MP from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running herself for the presidency.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was very advanced, it had fallen behind in fundraising, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men were only planning to give her $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she felt dizzy about it.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled about the press’ reaction to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
“She cried?”
How U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs affecting items worth US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing responded in kind, recently hitting customs duties of 5 to 10 per cent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the United States, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will falter soon.
Making Washington back is giving in to demands, but giving in public to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions conducive to an economic slowdown in either country is actually far more dangerous than what observers have previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, to the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who found himself in trouble for most of the tournament, pushed his start into the water at the 16th hole in par-3, ceding his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players to have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5-4 by the European team's worst-placed player, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, leaned 2 and 1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today it’s stronger than me.
It was a turbulent year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help it,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
“I feel an incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We have to bow.
We were overtaken.”
Red tide info point: Declining concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - fearing declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee County.
There are islets about 16 km (10 miles) off Hillsborough County, but fewer sites than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations at the bottom of Sarasota County or offshore, medium concentrations in Charlotte County and low concentrations in the broader Cove County and the broader Cove County.
Respiratory irritation persists in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
