Members of the Assembly of Wales fear 'passing through Marretas'
There is a dismay on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) over the suggestion that its title be changed to MWP (Deputies of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy lies in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Wales Parliament".
Some members of this House, of all political colours, fear that this will make them ridiculous.
A Labour AM said the group is concerned that "the designation rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Walis readers: in Welsh, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrement".
A Plaid AM stated that the group as a whole was “not content” and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative MP said the group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a similar pronunciation to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on the way the Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be made by themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave its assembly the powers to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which saw widespread support for the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the title of the MEPs, the Commission favoured "Welsh Members of Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favored in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to build consensus could be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce a draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to the way in which the Assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on disqualification of MFAs and the configuration of the commission system.
When they debate the legislation, the AMs will have the final say on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians to refer to change of country name
Voters will vote on Sunday on the change of their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which forms part of a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a complaint about its territory, and has repeatedly objected to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is nothing more than the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
Bells of St. Martin are silent at a time when Harlem churches struggle for survival
“In a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
“People socialize differently,” he said.
“The bars have ceased to be the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go regularly.”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of heritage will not last as long as the leaders expect and that sooner or later everything will return to exactly the point of departure.
The churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the remaining neighborhood shrines.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move into these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later built by a black congregation that carried out its cults in the immediate vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promoting black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell "the bells of the poor."
The expert who touched the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said it was the world’s first carillon to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather stated that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin’s in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that it "would seek to pass on its costs", unfortunately because it had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Teen in California Lobster Hunting Dive
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunting dive in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help, then rode toward him with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel claimed that he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but then realized that the boy was screaming "I was bitten"!
I got bitten!
The entire area of the collarbone was torn apart, Hammel described what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the trunk.
The authorities closed the access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation purposes and for security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style cosmetic sections backed by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain a share of the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion UK cosmetics market, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion clothing and household items decline, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and deployed in more stores next year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand on the part of supermarkets for ways to use exhibition space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its range of beauty products by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those of stores like those of Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products comply with vegan precepts, something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. The second, at Selly Oak, in Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing food shopping habits to small daily amounts in nearby stores have led supermarkets to now have to work harder to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly resemble big stores at a time when the supermarket chain is trying to fight discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, having also installed a number of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this has boosted sales of grocery products and made acquisitions more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from health care stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 outlets to Lloyds Pharmacy chain owner Celesio for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit every need, while the inviting environment and practical locations make us an irresistible point of sale for beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby abandoned <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was “furious” after TV host Holly Willoughby abandoned an 11 million-pound business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for the branding of homeware and accessories Truly.
The business of both had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she would abandon the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones vivid by abandoning the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was “furious” when the golden TV girl admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business — worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — meant she wouldn’t have time to devote to her brand of homeware and accessories Truly.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was boarding a plane to one of his overseas vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's highest priority.
It would mean the resolution of its future in the long term and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely astonished.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There’s a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at headquarters in Marlow.”
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, which is among Britain’s most lucrative bydes, could cost the company millions, given the massive investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for additional launch delays.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined the project as president in March.
The couples take vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity at ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we do not intend to comment on your business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
The president jokingly mentioned the criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would deem "unworthy of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said, in his fake voice of a "newspaper pivot."
"I didn't give in to anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, stressing that it would be a major step in denuclearizing North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding” U.S. response to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results: an end to rocket tests, support for the release of hostages, and the return to the country of the remains of the U.S. military.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had been evicted, no national catastrophe was declared, a prerequisite for the channeling of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been clear that they are not seeking international aid, so it becomes a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to head to Palu, there is no guarantee that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for the angers of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastlines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm mermaid in Palu, unfortunately the validity of a warning, contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who has made the improvement of infrastructure decaying a centerpiece of his election campaign, has spent huge amounts on roads and railroads.
However, the funding shortage has plagued Mr. Joko’s executive at a time when he faces his re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes a long shot for the draw goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea, with his team losing 1-0.
He touched his left before making a shot towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed to the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to reach that position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving forward as far as possible, so I was just winning as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched, and I didn't think too much about it.
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this move, the Blues forward gave a rear-heeled pass to Mateo Kovacic before demarking near the midfield and sprinting towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass to the midfield.
He then made a nice shot that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the large area.
He overtook the defenses and scored against the second-bar net with a left-foot shot from Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool faces Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. Wednesday afternoon at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. Thursday afternoon in London.
Number of deaths in Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster response agency said earlier Sunday.
There are reports describing a large number of people imprisoned in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbed woman to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged the population of the area that may have witnessed something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to everyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspected of contacting us.
I also want to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images with apron cameras, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us as they may have crucial information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the scene to inquire about where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, with police reporting that they are currently informing close relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to access his apartment, but was told by police that entry or exit of the building is prohibited.
When he was told what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being told that they can only return to their homes in hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly states that “it’s so horrible.”
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cord and one was parked in the area immediately outside.
A number of police officers were stationed inside the cordon to guard the apartment building.
We ask anyone who has information to contact DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating the registration number 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament became the latest monument swallowed up by the strife of "historical revisionism"
Their removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for their destruction, reminiscent of the perpetrated by the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and that was carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current debate on the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell near the Palace of Westminster would become a target to be struck.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony to the 19th-century opinion and part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of homage.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes an entirely accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-seventeenth-century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually notorious figure who represents one side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of homage and commemoration.”
Pork killer attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a Southwest China market, according to reports from local media.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut artery and covered in blood, near a piglet in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reads Sunday's South China Morning Post.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he has traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighboring piggy.
In that pig, he said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing 227 kilograms, had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and crushed,” the cousin, referred to by his nickname “Wu,” according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking other people while police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports state that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of attacks from pigs to humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as a “stimulus.”
“They’re just joking.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them due respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it travels over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the entire Mexican north and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., East Time on Sunday, Rosa caused gusts of 137 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression over the Pacific Ocean begins to take shape as it moves to the U.S. west coast. As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push strong tropical humidity northward into the southwestern U.S. zone.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain could cause dangerous sudden floods, floods of debris, and possibly desert landslides.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5 to 7 mm in spot zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions is possible, due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly advisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Strong precipitation can cause the gorges to turn into brave rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong point winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring heavy precipitation over parts of Southern California’s coastline.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause small floods of debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first wet season rainfall in the region.
A few scattered tropical rains will begin in Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered late on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread in the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October may see strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools down, but the tropical zones will remain fairly mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences across the central U.S. zone on Sunday.
There is a nearly 11-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to record a warm start to October, with widespread temperatures between 27 and 30 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures occurring in the eastern U.S. until the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations yesterday the gripping testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with stations disrupting regular programming due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her while drunk and tried to strip her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, a number found by Nielsen on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it were not yet available, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring audiences of those who view programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of audiences similar to the final of an American football game or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave strong support to Kavanaugh's appointment, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the audience that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Next comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement stating that his vote would be in Kavanaugh’s favor, the senator was caught by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being verbally attacked by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator to address a Judiciary Commission hearing.
The senator remained motionless staring at the floor as he was criticized live for CNN cameras.
“I’m here in front of you,” one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have power while so many women have no power at all."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judiciary Commission went to vote to make Kavanaugh's appointment proceed to a Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, which the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partially convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and subsequently with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, as it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘doing politics’ with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “doing politics” with Britain’s future and of damaging the national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview he gave on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the Brexit minister’s “Chequers Plan,” saying a proposal that Britain and the EU would cover the other side’s tariffs is “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Detain Suspect Dyteon Simpson of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police saying Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police picked them up at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he had killed Wayde with a gun.
A bail of $350,000 was set, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge parish’s medical-legal office issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound to the head that stretched around the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police action group, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and residents who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area authorities for their “diligence and effort to obtain justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
"That's what worries us all the time," Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano struck the neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters on Sunday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray covering the windshields of automobiles in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in activity from the volcano, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were detained in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and intervention police, as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, locked up by intervention police, struck her with eggs and threw powder ink, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also later clashes, in which police resorted to batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups chanting “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive” faced unionist protesters, shouting “Long live for Spain”.
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protests, you can read in the local press.
Tensions remain high in the region leaning towards independence, one year after the October 1 referendum that was deemed illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the influx to the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those against it.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing voting at polling stations across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
Independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although it was held, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we are blocked.”
Despite having won a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained awaiting trial since last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament in next year's elections.
"Standing up as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Crash on House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage had occurred to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may also have fired a beast at the car.
Menga's Attack Gives Livingston a 1-0 Victory Against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, stunned the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second loss of only two in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s attack made a difference, at a time when Gary Holt’s team changed levels, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team, which remains without a win away from home in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, have expanded their succession of non-defeat division matches to six games, with head coach Holt not losing a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against numb visitors
Holt's team should have gotten ahead of the score long before the goal, as the incisive character of his game was causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but let himself drag in front of the beacon and then Alan Lithgow only managed to steer his effort away after sneaking to find Craig Halkett's heading over the beacon.
The house team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors in the standing ball games.
And that's how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers granted a free and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, which gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At that point, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have much trouble.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow touched away from another Livingston stop.
Crossings to the large area of Livingston continued, which were successively resolved, and two high penalty claims, one after Halkett's raid on substitute Glenn Middleton and the other after a hand, were rejected by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland, at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall from giving their best throughout the game.
In any case, the Rangers showed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality shown at times with Gerrard, the team fell far short of these standards.
Their final move was little inspired (only once they managed to open the home team), forming a kind of warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received ambiguous in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of its country.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters made a presence in the immediate vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, near 10:15 am British summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died at the site.
The collision comes months after the death of another cyclist in a fleeing collision on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the person and inform their relatives.
Barriers and detours were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Injured in Disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in disturbances in a high-security men’s prison, the Prison Office said.
The disturbances, which are still ongoing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents "Tornado" have been summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one wing.
Agents were treated for minor facial injuries at the site.
A prison services spokesman said: “Specially trained teams have been used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, police intervention officers were summoned to resolve a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Pink threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (dry-affected areas may benefit)
It’s rare that a tropical depression hits Arizona, but it’s exactly what’s expected for early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwestern Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings of sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday for areas in southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rains.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden flooding, the rain of the Rose can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
“According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most severe category,” weather.com said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the continental mass crossing the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still hurricane-powered on Sunday morning, with winds at top speeds of 137 km/h, lies 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
“Total rainfall of 8 to 10 mm was expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with maximums of 25 mm possible,” weather.com said.
The Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then head south of Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
“The main expected danger from Rosa or its remnants is very high rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce sudden floods and floods of debris in deserts, at risk of life, and debris in mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with sharp gun injuries in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton near 4:00 am British summer time on Saturday.
It was transported to the hospital, where it remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were detained in the Radstock area overnight, Avon and Somerset police said.
Agents appealed to everyone who could have mobile footage of the incident to present.
Trump says Kavanaugh "was a victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "was a victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" on that day.
“A confirmation vote from Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote from one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president later referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican influx to the ballot box in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m actually running,” he said.
“That’s why I’ve been fighting everywhere for excellent candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy of the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; number continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, many of them dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation in their way.
The tsunami occurred in the wake of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of the incident,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency to mitigate the impact of the Indonesian disasters (BNPB) said in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not move on its own: it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal town continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive quake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, reads the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims have been found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications were "totally incapacitated and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could make it much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arose at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage posted on social media, you can see a man on the top floor of a building screaming frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to people down the street.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the coast, dragging buildings and automobiles.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the filming.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities. However, the evacuees still desperately need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to Palau’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami is rising exponentially to more than 800.
It's really bad.
While he managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where the staff are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the yard of their offices, Donggala World Vision staff went through scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's really bad.
Even as aid groups began the grim tasks of assisting the victims of the catastrophe, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign financing, supplies and personnel may only have access to the site if it is declared a “national disaster zone”.
This hasn't happened yet.
“This is still at a level of provincial catastrophe,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national catastrophe,’ we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist.”
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the still missing still held hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that dampen the shadowy headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of the imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paraglider, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the athletes of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only one gray check mark, rather than a pair of blues.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who replenished an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "came running behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was intended for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the site, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, received the nickname Ye some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled it for "emotional reasons," the creator of the show informed.
At the same time being an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he commented on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So, I am you, I am us, it is us.
It comes from Kanye, which means “the one” for only Ye – being just a reflection of our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former contributor to West, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO pledges not to resort to military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has pledged not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
Military fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have amounted to 300, when leftist student movements were spreading throughout Latin America.
López Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting them monthly grants to those who study and opening more public universities.
The president said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities dragged young people into criminal gangs.
US to double funding for artificial intelligence
At a time when China is stepping up its AI activity, the U.S. is expected to double its research spending on AI, said investor Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made announcements related to AI, even though the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on the matter.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so behind the U.S. and we are looking for the new AI revolution,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances of AI’s next major success being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello's top-ranked American player. Later, he served as executive at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's branch in China.
Lee credited previous U.S. government tech competitions as the Defense Agency’s Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, with a view to helping identify the next visionaries.
U.S. investigators often have to make a big effort to get state funding, Lee said.
“It is not China that is stealing from academic leaders; it is the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaires to work on AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I am of the opinion that AI doctorates should be automatically awarded green cards,” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to engage industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation intended to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not advanced for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on name change
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on changing the country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia," an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbor to the north represents a complaint about its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the mostly Slavic Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the ballot vote would be enough to meet the 50% necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue admission efforts with the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Elections Commission said there had been no records of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters attended to vote.
“I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change of name of the country, which would open the doors for its membership of NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We're from NATO and the EU, but we want to stick upright and not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that joining NATO will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the necessary influx.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the turnout has to be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major disruption in pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses all Brighton defense towards goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling knocked out Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win against Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the game.
He sprinted between three Brighton defenses before cutting to open field.
He was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pretended one defense before neutralizing in the race more others within the boundaries of the Brighton area.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the large area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with his right boot, defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal right now.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League confrontation.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball right in Brighton's territory in that move.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding off the boundaries of the field.
The City faces Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make Rockies' lives more difficult
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there was not much reason to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer has hopes of entering the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications regarding the final for the Rockies, who hold a lead over a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but still have plans to secure their first division title.
"While we're playing for nothing, at least we can get on the pitch knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting pitcher for Sunday, but there are those who say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the launches in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, did a session on the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington’s right-hander goes 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president later referred to the situation involving his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican affluence in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I’m not running, but I’m running and that’s why I’m everywhere fighting for excellent candidates.”
Trump continued, “You’re seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you’re watching it happen right now.
And they are determined to regain power using all the necessary means.
They don’t care who they attack, who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission of “resisting and obstructing.”
"And they've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, bad, sordid and liars."
The president referred by the name of Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, having received sound vaias from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did it cause the document to leak?
Uh, uh, what?
No, um, no, I, wait, one -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant of those who openly give their opinions.
When Momentum activists from my local party organization voted to censor me, it was no surprise to me.
At the end of the day, I am the latest in a series of Labour Members in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we have expressed our views openly.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was subjected to similar treatment because she resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues about which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
Notification to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday mentioned that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the General Committee meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "kinder and gentler" politics has long been forgotten, if ever.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged as to whether or not it is acceptable by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as the colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political perspective began to expect a turnaround from me and to take positions I would never agree with - whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn’t really matter what I say), there’s a torrent of insults on social media calling for “sendoff,” denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just me going through this.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never retreat before them.
One of the things that disappoint me most in this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with every motion of "censorship" or change of the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I've received countless advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and that it would be "all right" for me.
But that's not why I came here to make politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that left my comprehensive school classroom literally in debris, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as mayor or minister in government.
I never concealed my policies, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somehow confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is headed for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "sendoff" or political records will prevent me from acting in what I believe is in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals somehow twisted the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten without losses.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team lead the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in our games so far and we remain unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "Merits go to Ayr. They managed the risks better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute rehearsal, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to express the numbers, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's advantage with a big penalty, before, just before halftime, he scored and then converted a solo rehearsal to place the score at 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the downside to five points.
It followed a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was transported from stretcher to the outside and, after the restart, the Ayr reinforced the lead with a rehearsal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's incumbent captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted rehearsal by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure raid.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Climo without the ball, on the penalty throw, MacPherson placed the ball on the ground behind Ayr's progressing maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent the Gregor Henry wing for the fifth rehearsal of the home team.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the catering business
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears ready to enter the catering industry after learning he has been appointed director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC series, which he writes and plays with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, which is coming soon, will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source suggested Kiernan was intending to engage in the "flowering Glasgow Restoration Business."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a country devoid of coastline, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings have a navy-blue flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Getting him back is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, there is still the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, as well as the longing to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes are perhaps at the peak of decades, as Bolivia awaits a judgment by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IJT sentence pronounced on giant screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of their country’s claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much at stake in Monday’s sentence.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” the president’s votes were last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even otherwise.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ’s sentence is pronounced just six months after the final allegations were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have hurt it.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined some residual Chilean goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually rapid.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to embark on a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility "to put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without the country relying on the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons unless it first trusted Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises it made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy in a stalemate, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an “impossible dream” to consider that continued U.S. sanctions and objection to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean war would ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington fears accepting the statement without Pyongyang taking significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are seeking a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on their way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which surprised the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very impractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most prominent piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide feather-like flap that flooded the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-set watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in time for the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another resembled a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue this immense fashion affirmation, you are lucky.
Styling observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm flap that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that spread through social networks sent another great creation to the catwalks: a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in swimsuit that carried it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the most prominent piece of Jacquemus’ 2019 La Riviera spring-summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm waiting to see big hats and beach bags arrive in stores next summer. Since the designer had so much impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students spread across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for deepening their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a bespoke school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If we speak to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter his heart.”
This quote reminds us well that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of the recent exams this year, we find that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum rating of A.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained the highest score of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent Scottish schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and beyond.
A survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for employers’ difficulty in filling vacancies, 17% were related to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit proportion, 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for today’s children.
The proficiency of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with better chances of finding relevant employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in the independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed for success, whatever the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron starts Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is over for fans who want to see LeBron James kick off the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James will take part in Sunday’s pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes will be played remains to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell posted a tweet stating that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game schedule in the preseason.
"I don't need any pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump’s rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump begins a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of conformation pending for his pick for the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to strengthen support for the midterm elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s hearings of Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The confirmation vote envisaged in the Senate will be on hold for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main goal of this torrent of rallies is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain some momentum.
According to Reuters, the five rallies next week aim to "give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Control of Congress is as fundamental to the president's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the turmoil of the campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the early-night rally could attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh area's media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him with the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates strength to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of momentum is a fully invented sports concept, but it is one that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum will come now?
“They had a six-point lead and now there are four, so we’re looking at it as a bit of momentum,” Spieth said as he left the field at the end of the day.
Europe is in the lead, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those festive guttural screams became louder as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt that won the game in the 15th produced a similar scream, of the kind that reveals that he still believes the American team is still in the competition.
“We just need to focus and care about our own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed reveal of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but lovely, is four out of four and can't go wrong.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea is consolidated that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory to the sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the fourballs hero this morning, when in a team with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in front nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not, and the way strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better in team so far and gained a significant advantage in the final day. However, this foursome session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last day of the Ryder Cup with a slack lead after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday's matches with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
The duet inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods struggling to reach qualifying at the four-point Le Golf National so far.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, struggling to preserve the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two games won, but failed to shorten the downside.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points in the Sunday 12th singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to earn four points in a row when he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the only duet to earn four points in their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating a powerless Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled during two games on Saturday, revealed occasional hits of genius, but has already lost 19 of the games he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world ranking.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always take the best.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of major men’s tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a brave 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team reversed a four-point draw before the singles, although Furyk's team, the title holder, only needed to tie to retain the trophy.
After two days in the second position, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond its scope.
North Korea Says ‘No Thinking’ to Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were exacerbating mistrust of the United States and that there was no way for the country to unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as the discontinuation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test center and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
“However, we don’t see any corresponding U.S. response,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can proceed to our disarmament first.”
While Ri has recycled already known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded as it made gradual steps, his statements appear to be significant in that they do not preliminarily reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast to Pyongyang’s earlier positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, opposing until the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is exacerbating our suspicion.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the US leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the stakeholder in this issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that steering North Korea’s rockets toward U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump called Kim “the rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said much remained to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a calendar for this, noting that “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to strangle funding for North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later declared that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, although North Korea later denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile installation and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes corresponding measures".
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they were seeking were the security guarantees Trump took in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to fight the male culture of studying in caffeine-infused “directs.”
One professor concluded that students at this university at the top of the world rankings often had no idea about the most basic concepts of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?'
She said no one had ever mentioned to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after it concluded that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to pick up to bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as we all have a right to know the health effects of the smoking option,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “doing it straight” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we get enough quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid fattening, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of physical biology and chemistry, helped Professor Czeisler conceive the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a campus-wide course, he said.
The next step, according to your expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to consider using an alarm for bedtime, as well as waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulate circadian rhythm and lead to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another out-of-home onslaught of sadness when Dolly Menga’s attack caused Steven Gerrard’s disjointed team a 1-0 loss at Livingston Stadium.
The Ibrox team was looking to record their first win on their course since the 1-0 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team eventually inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the Scottish first division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half and the Rangers collective, devoid of inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With the Rangers now descending to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, and just behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
And even more problems may arise for the Rangers after line prosecutor Calum Spence received treatment for a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the visitor’s area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, for his part, used the same Livingston eleven that stole a point from Hearts last week, and he was delighted with the way his well-oiled team suffocated opponents in every move.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored right after two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middleman wasted his big opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish out towards the second beam.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game in the final third.
Surely Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been awarded a big quarter-hour penalty with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson refused the Colombian's appeals.
The Rangers got only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While Livingston’s goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected from the game’s development, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, let alone for its tenacity.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with Jacobs' long-stop ballplay.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the break, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this switch almost had an immediate impact when the side forward moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the blockade.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long pass behind long pass.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the finals, but McGregor stood up well, defending against Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again claimed a heavy penalty when he embarked on Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our almanac "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old and continues to count ... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like a uranium.
When we put these headphones on, we can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity on minerals."
Evans: "Look, now it's really crackling!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he gave the name to still endures.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches Immune System to “See” Harmful Cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory.
These cells, which can “see” a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2. These cells are then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “controls the growth of various types of cancer,” including those in the breast, ovary, lungs and also colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe in support of Trump wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was portrayed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would run for the 2020 presidential election.
After performing his song of the night, called Ghost Town, wearing a "Make America Great" hat, he initiated a bravado against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white man and he says to me, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist!'
"Well, if I had been concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star joked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcast, the scene of West's bravado was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They intimidated me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go over there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see marginalization?", saying, "I'd put on my superman cape, because that means no one tells me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments provoked public outcry and SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with someone from the show telling the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love It disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a rally of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: “To one of our most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR THE TURBAN BETWEENERS.”
However, interview show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “being what it is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying their music or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is welcoming and propagating harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And so are we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "the formerly known as Kanye West."
West is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg once used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Prosecution of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The accusations will be examined by the prosecutor.
War of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a fencer as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series War of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the male hero’s stereotype, claiming that such screen roles often make boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something went wrong” and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his War of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also a 31-year-old, admitted that he has a "pretty strong position" on addressing the problem.
“I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men when they are growing up in terms of the problem we are facing now?”
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter into any prequels or sequels of the War of Thrones when the series ends next summer, referring to him as the "battlefields and the horses" ended.
From November, Kit will participate in a re-issue of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the War of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple knotted in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmission through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of year-on-year variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that due to the country’s conservative values, 70-90% of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases derive from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication since 2003 as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leak of information about Republican senators by her collaborator and attacks “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her team posted personal information from three members of the U.S. Senate on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were being promoted by opinion leaders and "right-wing" websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement.
The published information allegedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with Waters’ office and published the data of a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
“This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by virtue of these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak of information.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot become angry.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
It must reveal calm and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will contest Waters' place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the competent authorities” to these fraudulent allegations.
“We ensure that the culprits will be disclosed, and will be legally held accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English Attacks Again - weak parody of espionage film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new movie with a British flavor, and this seems to actually apply to the new edition in the comedy and action movie series Johnny English, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satire on the subject of being so bad the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his blurred eyes and an overly elastic expression, got his license to create confusion, renewed a second time - with his name signaling, more than anything, that it is a comprehensive comic creation intended for non-English-speaking cinematographers.
He's, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and something from that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the movie "Moments of Glory" at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in the TV ads for Barclaycard, which left chaos in his wake.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a chime against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but the humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that "serious" film editions such as 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We got the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English’s bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film numbers in Bean’s character.
Now, the always current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the consternation of the service agent, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this role that reminds of Theresa May’s character, but the storyline doesn’t give much material for big flights.
Her secret services advisers inform her that once all the active agents have been compromised, she will have to pull someone out of retirement.
And this one is the clumsy Johnny English, now working as a teacher at a fancy school, but giving unofficial lessons on how to be an undercover spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "Rock School."
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his suffering auxiliary Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, an elusive character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the catastrophe in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova, role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously bewitched by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurdly disastrous acts: disguised as waiters, they set a flashy French restaurant on fire, create confusion by penetrating as clandestines on the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of the house of Volta.
All stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but as friendly and stormy as it is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Labour denies that they are creating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day work week but with five days’ pay.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to pass on the savings with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers, granting them an extra day off.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the salary.
Sources point out that the idea "would fit" into the party's economic program, which redirects the country in favor of workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek gained the favorable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: “We look forward to announcing a policy review before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration adjusted to the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not currently favored by the entire Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of “faceless directors” and “speculators” of basic services companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the entire share of the current shareholders of water companies, since the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illicit conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place workers on the boards of directors of the companies and create Inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, who will be able to pocket annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether or not the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I was going to the hearing," he said, "I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this allegation appeared, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be needed," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentioned couldn’t confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new to change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars who will perform on an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people on the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to watch performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) viewers had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other significant ways that contribute to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of “clickitivism” – thinking it makes a difference to sign a petition online or send a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, with at least $10 billion related to them already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which promised to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote of history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 pressures on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund a project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the site’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responds: “It was a long and tortuous journey – sometimes we fell and failed.
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use navy as ‘blockade’ to impede Russia’s energy exports
“If necessary,” Washington may resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, in particular, where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they intend to intermediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to effect blockages to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In his speech, he went on to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, saying they are effectively the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick magician” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inadequate” Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the $11 billion Nord Stream pipeline aims to double existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons, an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Russia's energy minister Aleksandr Novak said in a meeting with U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “deeply analyze” the possibility of running for president in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “deeply analyze” the possibility of running for president following the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the top manager," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will thoroughly examine the possibility of running for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.”
"I'm extremely worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s own constituents are not of the opinion that she should run for president in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator shouldn’t run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe’s Center for Political Research.
32% support your application.
The poll showed higher support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's post-traumatic stress at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after he has returned, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers actually come back with,” he told the public at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "come back a little different, come back hardened, come back asking if there is such respect for what his comrade soldiers and airmen, and all the other members of the armed forces, have given to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence over a woman and possession of a gun while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district sent a statement amicus curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
The person said her partner "and her children, members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 Immigrant Resources Council decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignored decades of state, federal and international laws.”
“Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle,” the amicus curiae statement read.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that police’s ban on immigrants’ entry negatively affects the U.S. economy, noting that immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “to make the necessary workforce available.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when death toll doubles in a counter-clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, mother of a feverish male baby, comforting him at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
There were hundreds of wounded and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured his ribs and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were soaked in tears as he reported what he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was stuck in the ruins of the wall, I believe,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda announcements”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, the state's most-drawn newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the Nov. 6 congressional elections, an allegation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the beginning of what U.S. officials, in statements to Reuters, have designated as a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish announcements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff waves on imports from the other side.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertising ads in our free press.”
“With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
“On the other hand, in the benches here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have of their country’s worrying economic trajectory, as the media is under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault charges, analysts warn that this could spark a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the midterm elections to take place soon.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward to a vote.
These things have no setbacks,” he told The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation is enough to appease revolted voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants chanted “November is at the door!” as they marched in the Senate courtyard, as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will break all records," Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no party affiliation, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high; it’s true.
But it may be even higher, particularly among undecided voters in suburban areas and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a negative reaction could occur if Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as judge, it's also about how Republicans handled the matter and how they handled it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford’s allegations, as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford swore to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh sexually molested her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court appointee exposed his genitals when the two attended a party during the time they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has created a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the underlying intent of Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data warehouse,” or POD.
This may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in a single browser and simultaneously.
What is unique about the personal online data warehouse is that it is exclusively up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some in-house programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all of their business models are reversed overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web created with Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Bernard Vann: Tribute to the cleric decorated with the Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only cleric of the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in his hometown after 100 years.
Reverend Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the award on 29 September 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the feat that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the crossing of the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable weapons and machine guns".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, "with the utmost courage," led the line forward before attacking alone a cannon and shooting down three detachment soldiers.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s acts were “something I know I would never be able to match, but also a lesson in humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts awake all night to see Bellator 206 watch instead Nuca Peppa
Imagine this: stay up all night to see Bellator 206, full of vedets, and in the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 matches, with six from the main group, and was being aired live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for the confrontation, viewers in the UK were astonished when the coverage shifted to Nuca Peppa.
Some were not impressed after being awake until dawn especially for combat.
A Twitter fan described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad-tasting joke.”
“Government regulations say the content is not suitable for six o’clock in the morning, so they had to switch to another schedule,” Dave Schwartz, administrator with the marketing and communications field, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said it will rectify the schedule of broadcasts to include spectators from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem," Coker said.
“But it’s six Sunday morning there and we won’t be able to solve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I’m not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We're trying to fix the problem, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn’t: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and we exaggerated.
It is a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘inferior’ to his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that it gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with Radio 4’s first Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out for gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also stated that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The longtime regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a several-month break due to illness.
Appearing as a pariah on Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
“To this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real motive that gave me the power and strength to achieve success.”
His goal was to prove he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they sooner or later discovered their sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he expressed himself because he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013, "came me by surprise."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, though he said age difference was never a problem.
“When we went through so much when we’re so young” – his first Olympic participation was at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said, it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son last June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all their perspective" had changed.
“If I had been asked last year, all that mattered was to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had the tickets to the 2012 London Games because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you’re not going to be here to be on the front row, Dad,” he said.
"I was holding him out of hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics ... there was no better feeling,” he said.
All of this was also the inspiration for her first choice of song - Heather Small's Proud - with which she had identified during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m. British summer time.
Mickelson down on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to regain his shape to prevent the milestone from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record number of entries, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often been in the United States teams, the five-time winner of the men’s major championships divided the day between the supporter role and the work on his field game, hoping to rectify what afflicts him.
Having never hit the straightest even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf Nacional course, where rough long usually punishes errant shots.
And if the field alone wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson on Sunday’s ninth match will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four matches they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point downside starting the 12 singles matches, record a good start, Mickelson’s departure can prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could affirm much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he kicked me on the back, put his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a respected champion who has given a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I thought more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to move on.
He wants to be in the game, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never matched the successes of his individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has claimed his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
“He’s sarcastic, funny and witty, he likes to play with people, and he’s a great person to have in the team room.”
“I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just playing.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his big advantage can disappear in a peak
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his loose lead by entering the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily become a rough ride.
The Dane had his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros retained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with his nose at the narrowest margin, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but close," Bjorn said in the picture, after watching the 2018 5-3 Tour victory, both Friday and yesterday, to lead 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, do your best.
Go over there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the scoreboard.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should stay.
I’ve always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of who’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never do it myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is individual performances and that involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we’re there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they’re going to leave their partner and he has to go and give the best of himself, too.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will look for his players to perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who earned three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big twists on the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe took the "Miracle in Medinah" out of the box.
"I remember every word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this impetus moves to one side, the pressure is very high in these middle matches.
We’ve organized our squad accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we’re going to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas, on a mission to try to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers the entire route," Bjorn said of his choices for the singles.
New German warship once again postponed
The German navy's latest frigate should have entered service in 2014 to replace Cold War-time warships. However, it will have to wait until at least next year due to systems prone to failure and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the newest frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the navy in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels that the navy had ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, in addition to a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance, which would allow the latest frigates to be sent on missions lasting up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, continued delays have meant that with state-of-the-art warships, considered a way for Germany to project power across borders, they will already be outdated when they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a number of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the contingent needed in the oldest frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to install additional functionality in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to have twice the weight of ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros, an increase from the 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems afflicting the most recent frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used.
The problem has grown exponentially over time, as older ships have been put out of service without any vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to join the navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
Further research is underway on a property in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to look for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these singular flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats, as well as long-eared browns and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations scattered around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will assess the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviors at the territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects the results to reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow breeding, as well as how best to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affects dormitories and scarce habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a threat, along with fly-killing papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo tracking technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly carry out studies, inspections of dormitories and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats at Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The property’s director, David Thompson, says it’s the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
“We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there’s still a lot about bats that we don’t know about, so the work we’ve done here and on other properties will help us know more about what they need to flourish.”
It was emphasized by him the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance on the properties, because the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dorm can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, head of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don’t know how their populations are avenging.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to prosecute German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” stating that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he would then have paid $375,000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, reads Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were released, 33-year-old Ronaldo characterized the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-Golden Balls winner told the chamber.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I’m a happy home and it’s all right,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they characterized as “an unacceptable report of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would demand compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where the player violated her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him he was "99%" "a good guy", hurt by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also alleges that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she would later have agreed to enter into an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "terrified by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims she intends to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged assault. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' losing automakers
The UK would “repent forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU disorderly by the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other automakers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would shut down its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what manufacturers claim are the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, disruption at the border could occur, which the sector says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s “Chequers Plan” for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We need to have a deal, and we want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the seizing of this opportunity by us," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“Evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers indicates that we absolutely need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Although it was unable to give an estimate of downtime, Toyota said that in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and could sooner or later lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union there, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, if lost, these jobs will never return.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed another week" given there is still no understanding about Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump may be preparing to fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of covertly recording the talks with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not to fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final Senate vote.
Trump’s press adviser Sarah Sanders attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, it may be this week but it may also be postponed another week in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disagree with such a statement: Sanders has not hosted a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonism."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, adding, without adding any evidence: “We’ve looked at these numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We tried to do this often and they saw that we did it in the last few weeks. The fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences when he receives foreign representatives.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way to the journalists present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at Scottish National Health Service on Brexit fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to pay for applications for resident status for EU citizens working in the country’s decentralized public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued, and decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this moment how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationalities.
Peers from across the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defenseman Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tigers' Mike Organ said.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
“He approached the sideline and practically fainted,” Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff placed Abercrombie’s oxygen in the sideline before lying on a stretcher and transporting it for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/severity of the injury" and that the team is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five plaques on Saturday before leaving the game, which raises his season total to 18 plaques.
A higher stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers when acquiring properties in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher stamp tax on foreign buyers who acquire properties in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in helping the homeless.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract younger voters
The increase of the stamp tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp tax rate will be levied on foreign buyers who purchase properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in helping the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to provide more affordable housing and tax higher incomes.
The stamp tax hike will focus on people and businesses that are not taxed in the UK, with the additional revenue boosting the government’s campaign to provide a homeless home.
The surcharge – added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second dwellings and lease purchases – could amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by hoarding land they did not use, demanding that Mrs May abandon quotas on affordable housing to resolve the "disgrace of housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an appealing set of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to evictions “without justification.”
It also wants to give municipalities extended powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that it is as easy to buy home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for resident British workers.
For too many people the dream of owning their home has become too distant, and the shame of those who sleep in the relaxation remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "ultimate ambition" is to become a Scottish national team picker.
The 42-year-old has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the northeastern club, currently third-placed in the First League, three points ahead of the lead.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalization," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
“I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But that opportunity will only arise if you succeed in managing clubs.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he was not afraid to succeed such established names in such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, at the moment success comes down to, 'Can I take the club back to the Premier League?'
"Given the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It will not be easy to bring the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I achieve that goal."
Ross's coaching career is only three years old, after a period as Dumbarton's deputy coach and 15 months on the Hearts technical team.
He then helped the Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of depromotion to the title of champion the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he has ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I’ve always seen myself more in the role of coach than in the role of player.
It seems strange because it went well, I earned my life as a player and had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face a lot of challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and pressures of the position, but I feel very good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I have ever felt throughout my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heatwave filled British pubs but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Catering groups recorded 2.7% growth in sales in July, but restaurant occupancy decreased 4.8%, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of England's good weather and career at the World Cup, longer than expected, made the June standard, where pubs posted a 2.8% growth in sales, if repeated in July, but restaurants saw a decline.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the beverage-based business performed by far the best, with a homologous growth that more than offset the downturn of the restaurants.
The pubs with the meal-based business also faced difficulties, though not as dramatic as those of the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% over the month, with meals falling 3%.
Paul Newman, an analyst in the leisure and catering sectors RSM, said: "These results prolong the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing sales of the food market outside the home.
It is no surprise that catering groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is especially damaging when added to the prolonged cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for operators with the meal-based business. Only weather will tell if the milder temperatures we know in August will provide the much-desired relief."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slower brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sector indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, being recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in five children hide secret accounts from parents on social media
One in five children — some just 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers, a study found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of "fake" pages on Instagram
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account to show their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 years old – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake” accounts on the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a harmless “main” account to show parents, while also owning private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account discovered that the teen was inciting others to “rape her.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors’ Conference (HMC), found that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be the 'voice of athletes' at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the annual general meeting of the regulator.
Doyle is the most medal-winning Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of his vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that Scottish athletics will have much to gain from her presence on the Board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be able to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to truly contribute to helping guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, failed to walk after suffering a transient ischemic stroke.
As he wrote on Twitter: "Today it's been a month since I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if he could recover and to what extent.
It has been a hard work but I have achieved a total recovery, I have relearned to walk and I even do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Milk pump ad compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A milk pump company shared opinions online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is described as the “first portable silent milk pump,” consumer tech company Elvie released an ironic announcement inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom given by the new pump to mothers who pump milk.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled cowhouse to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The chorus goes on: "Bombe, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, I'm milking my girls."
However, the ad posted on the company’s Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it lightens the “horrors” of the dairy sector.
"Sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born,” one viewer wrote.
The Elvie pump fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic to the mother and to the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise an extraction bomb for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone also said, "An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted to finding the song "humory."
“I think the idea is great.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy but it makes all sense.
This product is great,” wrote one of the women.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad for mothers who pump milk (often in bathrooms or in the workplace) and feel like ‘cows.’
It is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who pump milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies and even leave the house while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother," commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women who pump milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way that people can identify with the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new pump.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was headlined.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly displaced to a Texas border camp
The number of migrant children detained has peaked, despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s rhetoric and harsh policies have made it difficult for children to be sponsored.
Traditionally, most of the “godparents” are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country when offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adults who integrate their households would have to register their fingerprints, the data being shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the service detained dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no criminal record.
Nearly 80% of the sponsors or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners with a criminal record.
So we will continue to persecute these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to the employees of the shelters.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid shall be promptly deported.
The longer children remain detained, the greater the likelihood of feeling anxious or depressed, which can lead to attacks of violence or attempted escape, according to staff at the shelters and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as those in Tornillo, where the large dimension contributes to the disruption of children being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces”
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees, despite the country’s war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such."
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is nearly over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions still displaced.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions for his return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led the refugees to remain abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone at the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement set “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including Al-Nusra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, who “will be eradicated.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, setting the stage for elections.
Moualem has established conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the challenge and scandals end his presidency in advance.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, primetime audiences have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primetime viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a strong lure to people because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor," said of a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalls once calling a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Naturally, unlike television shows, stories from Washington could determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunion for immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, it’s more than being an informed citizen when we’re watching the sixth hour of an expert debate about Bob Woodward’s use of “deeply knowledgeable” sources in his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment full of insolence,” as the Washington Post pointed out) and the implications of the President’s...
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s been doing feels like a reality show because he gives us something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s dynamic cast and the daily twists and turns of the plot.
We can't miss any episodes or we're left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
It did not detach from television as Brett Kavanaugh prepared to testify before the Senate Justice Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I still remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but after all, you were right.”

Significant external funding in midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th circle knows an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of the electoral circles that left two headlines in the race for the same place.
The recent adjustment of the Pittsburg suburban circles put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th Circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th Circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that former circles unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The race for the 17th circle triggered a fierce campaign funding dispute between the financial arms of major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested March extraordinary elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional constituency.
This place was occupied for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to Democrats.
US considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization from management.
State Department officials have decided to call U.S. diplomatic representation leaders in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
With the continuation of internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to move forward, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on the internal deliberations under cover of anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study the History
The next bomb to be dropped could be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, about which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will allegedly be guiding his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability from that body, while preparing to re-enact voters and perhaps be tried by his peers.
There are many hypotheses and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – or that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to testify to Hitler in a coup, provided that the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around inflection points like this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
Americans are currently facing several of these points of inflection.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating about his inability to hold the post.
Rosenstein says the Times news is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we drop these tests, democracy will be about to go through a long desert.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, how could he not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the match with the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until the two-goal draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a springboard for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We faced the game with a positive mindset and got a point.
Maybe we could have won close to the end, but overall, the tie was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first half but we went around and dominated in the second half.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can achieve all three points. It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year was very hard, with all my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success.”
Women are losing sleep with fear of this savings-reform account
Despite the fact that the survey participants have a clear idea of the type of care they intend to enjoy, few people have spoken to their relatives about the matter.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not having that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how to get started.
Speak to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless you tell them your desires in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financing choices for continuing care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a monetary valuation hybrid policy to help cover those expenses, or financing using your own savings, as long as you have these amounts available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care attorney, choosing a person you trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Also consider the constitution of a power of attorney over your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make the financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your bills will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is suffering a medical emergency and is on his or her way to the hospital.
Would you know how to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“Not just financial issues are at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan."
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure upon returning home after a night in the city.
The victim, in her forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening and police have asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to increase.
With communications interrupted, first responders were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The region, with a lower administrative status than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died buried beneath the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
Earthquakes have destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been detained on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was detained on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is detained pre-trial at Mat-Su’s pre-trial detention center, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," the station reported.
Palin faces charges of three class A offenses, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B offence, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the reporting of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans’ associations for associating her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress stemming from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died in the aftermath of an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have been cut, the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the central Sulawesi region, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York
The New York prosecutor's office is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck hired by Home Depot to carry out an October attack on a cycling path on West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and inflicted “intentionally” serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, registered in the Southern Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder in the service of organized crime, usually used by the prosecutor in organized crime cases, and an indictment of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “considerable planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed him as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern Zone of New York did not ask for the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favor of the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documentation, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded innocent on all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty confession to life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the accusers not to apply for the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's deputies suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Rear MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have “already left” if Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionists was underlined by the conservatives who defended the stay, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been debating to maintain her compromise plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit supporters, permanence advocates and the EU.
The allies insist that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan."
Bone suggested that Farage should have been assigned responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were the one responsible, we would have left,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.”
Reinforcing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to remain is totally insane."
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, telling journalists: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular with our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: “Only prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs.”
Farage said at the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are ready to betray the decision coming out of the 2016 referendum.
"This has become a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get away with it.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, she added: “I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud, self-governed UK.”
Meanwhile, proponents of the stay marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A crowd of activists drew tracks with the message “Conservatives against Brexit” following the group’s launch this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security issues they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
"It is these people who tell us they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'Canada more', for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete hoax.
There is no good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren plans to 'seriously weigh' on possible presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously weigh the presidential candidacy” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican MP Geoff Diehl, co-mandator of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that he could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump’s inauguration.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it’s time “for women to go to Washington to fix our government’s problems and that includes a woman in the top place.”
Arrest in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims of the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, after which he ended up dying," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted his presence at the scene, holding a gun, admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Station.
Sims, a 1.98-meter junior raised in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and scored 10 times last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoverys per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from Valtteri Bottas qualifying in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxes and caused Hamilton to face traffic from the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the pits a lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a fierce skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen came out of the last row of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, switching tires too late, which would allow him to be fast in the final, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He ended up coming to the boxes in the 44th lap but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish in fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman, letting me outperform him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she would not have revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but instead commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad, malicious, and false."
“Look at the beautiful thing that’s happening in the Senate in the last few days, look at the anger, see how bad, malicious, and fake people are,” Trump said.
“When we see the leaks of information and the communiqués and when they say ‘oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape leave you?
Do you remember her answer-- did you release the document?
Oh, no. No.
The escape didn’t come from me.”
Well, wait a minute.
The escape left us... No, it wasn’t us,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied that the escape had left his cabinet.
“I didn’t obscure Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during Saturday night’s rally: “You know what else, that was a terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn’t her, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court appointee accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see the evil, the malice, it doesn’t matter who they can hit, who they have to step on to take power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from the loss on Friday in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants got an initial two-goal lead with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald secured the team’s victory.
It was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had made a turn on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer’s first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frantic first period, Sullivan returned to the home team at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided Cownie with the draw at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants reached the first break in the lead, scoring their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The house team reorganized and Bouchard tied again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second half, securing victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, will host Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller killed to help hundreds of passengers flee earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died by ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to ravage the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post as the control tower shook violently at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained focused to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower in the face of the imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television network ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could reach thousands, referring to the country’s disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the rubble that we have not yet been able to rescue," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
There's a lack of drinking water.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don't know what we will find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, according to CNN sources, addressing the military on the spot and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations.
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports missing man after plane crash in lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that one man is missing after it reported that all 47 passengers and the crew had been safely rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said it had been unable to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The company said it was collaborating with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all with a stable medical condition.
It is not yet clear what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of the events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in asserting that the plane failed to reach the runway and moored in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had left the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was too low.
“It was the best thing that happened,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others had managed to crawl the water down the waist and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on a nearby wetland improvement work also helped rescue by resorting to an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank to 30 meters (100 feet) depth.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in a new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old defendant Quintom Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When asked by the prosecution if Tellis was telling the truth by claiming he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville.
Another incongruity in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"It erased her from her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin submitting its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be reviewed by the jury at the end of the day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based group The High Breed claims that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to go back to these roots and return popularity to conscientious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York woman sues couple for firing via 'racist' SMS
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after they mistakenly received an SMS from their mother complaining that she was "more of a black woman."
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming the process was an act of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed some fear when she discovered that the new mistress Giselle Maurice was black when she presented for her first day of work in 2016.
“I can’t believe ... A BLACK one more,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she noticed her gaff, a "embarrassment" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice alleging the poor performance of the previous African-American nanny and who was expecting a Philippine nanny.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent home from Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and seeking $350/day layoff compensation for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
“I want to show you that you can’t go unpunished,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying firing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent him something that I didn’t really want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people,” Plasco told the Post.
"Would your children trust someone who had treated them badly, even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it."
Calling the process “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with “a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going after someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the legal process proceeds, the public opinion court was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers might not identify with a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun for us to know this now, after Paddington has been so successful.”
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before he was inspired by a little play bear writing the children’s book, would not have taken to his chest had the book been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication had a bittersweet taste given his passing last year.
About Paddington, who described him as "a very important member of our family," he said the father was very proud of the success achieved.
“He was a modest man and not a person given to pride,” he said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we’re proud even when it’s not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on my phone.
Shortly after landing, her daughter had been rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain to save her life.
"Nad would often call to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"So Nad called and said she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
All together.
The medicines the doctors had given her to keep her heart working were slowly failing to work and leaving her system.
He had died for some time and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stand there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or lament because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to restrain myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other strangers to the trial she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
“I always cried down on my head.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women hang cards on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are struggling to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and 18 years old when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to have to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Sharon Davis, 45, a Lydney resident, said the son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it would light up the room.”
However, he quit work before dying because he had “dipped in darkness.”
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible repercussion."
Sharon Davis created the postcards "so that you know there are people who are available to help and with whom you can talk, even if you're a friend.
Don't shut yourselves, you have to speak."
Kelly Humphreys, Sharon Davis’ long-time friend, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after her mother-in-law’s death.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," he said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, there was a rag. When the kids opened the presents, you didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destroy a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation
"I thought that by having the resemblance to what I had asked for - an investigation with defined time and scope - we could be closer together," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "falling apart" in the face of an entrenched partisan impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
His reluctance is merely a temporary matter.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, and on November 6, if, as expected, Republicans fail, they will see their attempts to elect their Supreme Court candidate frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors drops during Kim’s regime
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un's rise to power seven years ago.
In citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 defections occurred last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people smugglers ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public statements.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean defectors.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal emigrants and not refugees, and it is common to repatriate them.
Relations between North and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss denuclearization negotiations that are in a stalemate.
The talks came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly speaking, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for lack of progress.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all legations of sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotional opening statement, sometimes in a loud and sobbing voice, speaking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly accused the Democrats of the commission, nicknamed the allegations made against him of “the grotesque and conspiracy-like assassination” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court given his prejudiced behavior against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's effective appointment and if the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can say is that lying to Congress or the FBI doesn’t qualify for the Supreme Court, or even for serving in your current court,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the District Court of D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he feared Kavanaugh's potential opinions against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions about whether certain Supreme Court decisions could be revoked.
"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and hope that we will be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women have to be able to control their emotions.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and it cannot breathe without crying.
“We weep when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a strange thing, do you think?"
A woman with an executive position at any company helped me a lot. She told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she had created a technique. When she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job in an office dominated by men in which I cried inexpressible anger, being grabbed by the neck by an older woman - an unfriendly manager who terrified me a little - and literally dragged up the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy they’ve managed to affect you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Colorado Democrat, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential run.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business and dropped the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder couldn't see why she couldn't run for the presidential election herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who dubbed the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given his late arrival, the fundraising was below the desirable and swore that he would only enter the race if he could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, even though they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When she announced that she would not enter a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top — gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and bring the message to voters, rather than delegates, and anger against sexism — and tears arose.
“It even seemed like she was depressed,” Schroeder recalled as she spoke of the media’s reaction.
"I would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
What would they now write on my epitaph?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial for Beijing
The first salvage of the trade war between the U.S. and China was deafening, and while the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of experts, the separation of the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump triggered the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was the scene of a significant worsening of the situation with new taxes to affect goods worth $200 billion, actually taxing half of all goods shipped by China to the U.S.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently rising rates from 5 percent to 10 percent for U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will falter in the near future.
Making Washington back would mean succumbing to demands, but showing public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively sustain China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In fact, the fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is Ready for Refugee Return
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have left due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the revolt.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Team beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive losses on European soil since last winning the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe once again crowned itself victorious after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties during almost the entire tournament, threw the starting tee into the water in hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst-ranked player of the European national team, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
The world’s highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England’s Ian Poulter in what may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the most awarded European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“It’s not my habit to cry, but today I couldn’t contain myself.
It was a tough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm immensely happy that we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said.
He gives the floor to his countryman Jon Rham who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in singulars on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel in defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play," Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. National Team struggled to get to the fairway.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear into Europe.
We fought.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and I will collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like many of these 12 players and I am proud to be their captain.
I have to take the hat off the other team.
They were better."
Updated information on the Red Tide: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
