The populist right-wing triumph in Austria together makes up 29%
Early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the right-wing populist party.
The Austrian People's Party (OVP) has suffered heavy and special losses, where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
Worse still, the OVP has finished, losing 25.6 percent, nearly nine percent of votes.
They are the worst, literally catastrophic results in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war era and especially for the populars who convened these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation was heard about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, deputy chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved as early as Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path to the constant and more approximate starting point of the electoral results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
Given that the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, an eleven percent of the vote - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would be repeated in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 the BZO came to a share of the BZ).
Haider clearly bets on this evolution, who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is already assuming his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore is not part of the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may get colder
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally harvesting beetles is not resolved, it could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not resolved then yes, then this cooling would be safely achieved," he said after the meeting, which was organized on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was exempt from charge and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“Their problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
He can then request the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague spoke on the same terms during the meeting.
“It is advisable to appeal to the High Court and then pardon would be possible,” the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted a "legal competent support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already obtained by the Indian side.
“We have the utmost interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, he insisted before his colleague that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
“I’ve received a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech referee a fight on the seafloor
I approach an electronic wall map, depicting Australia surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a little lost spot in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its boss, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this enthusiasm and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed hides to this day a little known world, rich in natural sources.
You can find petroleum and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown organisms so far that themselves carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the land
The coastal countries have begun today to vigorously dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the so-called Continental Border which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all resources of the Continental Border.
"Simply, by continental edge is meant the part of the seafloor and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the boundary of the coast of the sea, and often the boundary of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer boundaries of the continental border, must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a specialist technical and legal assistance commission.
The commission has so far processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have gone forward," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a worldwide impact as it was the first that essentially expanded its marine dominance.
However, New Zealand also got it - the seafloor surface that the commission granted it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains for their study.
The gain from the use of the seabed will be, as promised, invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the Continental Border ends begins the ocean floor region declared by the Treaty as the "common heritage of humanity".
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
“The seabed, however, is not a gold mine,” says director Mikulka, adding “that its separate zones are legally and clearly restricted and its contractually defined regime.”
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It is licensed to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
“An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the German special forces command was in place of action
To resolve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for the help of Germany – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue action.
Thus at the place of liberation were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of the GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charitable institution.
As ministry spokesmen reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The government of Egypt accepted Germany's help to use it as support on the spot.
“Fortunately, that time didn’t come,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
On September 19 in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in the southern desert region of Egypt, the hostages were deported back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the guardianship of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return in Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Does Not Approve Salvation Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has failed with scarcely a large $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes to 206 the government’s package for saving financial markets.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, it did not reach a majority for the program with which the disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action the desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked MPs to vote even though the plan is not as popular.
"It's hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn't happened at all yet," he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concerns that the state rescue package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order to allow the program to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to a study, the volume of sales of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened juncture, the Germans' desire to travel remains as before.
As the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the market research institute GfK, reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus, the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more than in 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are figures from GfK which are the information analyzed on bookings at 1,200 travel agencies and calculated approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar, especially trips to the United States are in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destinations of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices rise, in this case travel expenses are "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months travel was well booked, so sales volume compared to last year rose again - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared to last year, fell.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Spa, the beer in one-liter jars and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a custom Bavarian traditional costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: we are just in tent, the photographers already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it is very flattering especially because I am first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional Bavarian costume seems to fulfill its function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in traditional Bavarian costumes to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at Teresa's Prado everything is not so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian outfits or leather pants; none seem to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets rare looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A woman from Munich draws my attention to my apron which was dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is a widow."
Oh, God, now I'm hanging from behind to the left.
"Okay," he says laughing.
The others don't care about many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their ass knot.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistically is named Bob, is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
To him it looks "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "or".
He tells me after he put his glass of a liter of beer next to him that he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most think that's a trash can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
Others aren’t very lucky and can’t consume as much alcohol.
At about eight o’clock in the night, the groups of sanitaries run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear each time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered walkways from one tent to another.
That works like most visitors: they come sober, they come drunk.
You don't see who suffers from the degrees of alcoholemia and is on the walks.
“They’re the ones who “can’t do any more,” a sanitary officer answered my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian has been identified who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers were nesting the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in a neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides say.
The building is set to end the platforms and carries in front of two towers, one for each corner, all looking like a typical German city hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the vaulted box office was over, there is no doubt what was the grandeur of the company that this was the westernmost gate.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "late-eater" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below the borders of the United States.
British rule and as forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then the station has been decaying and left out of the story.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new collaboration policy.
The Turkish government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I got on a bunk bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert on foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of jolts, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, meant to rule a new secular state, away from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigmatic shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "power pastries" where middle-class managers in business suit - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
This is not a case if it is not for one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "could Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replies, "does not want to face that choice."
He then underlines a point that almost everyone I have spoken to so far had almost recited to me in memory: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole of the Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States, as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: With Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically assemble those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again to the station of Hydarpasha, after a second sleepless night, my thought goes back to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, in large part, would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt in which continent this fascinating country must claim.
Life to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford Musical Director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Esquela, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under-21s, but by the time Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were finishing the 20s - just refuse to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the form-changing mythological being) represented the choir's willingness and ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
All you have to do is sing!”
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, although never taxable, nor too flowery.
Whatever the musical crush, it always ended at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades that he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that never, by any, I’ve been disappointed – otherwise, I’ve often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply “sold one or two very well-known warhorses around the world.”
We'll miss it a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25) you state that "in 1946 economic history studies were resumed at Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research scholarship... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctoral degree."
This is learned in a note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention for their simplicity and for the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second round for Honda's bestseller
In November Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
Added to this are refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and allow you to save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation to the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where the Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz will allow to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 units of Jazz, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a growth of 17% in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a compact-sized five-door hybrid – 4.37 meters in length – which the Japanese company expects to market around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and by the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented in partnership in the month of January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz is growing in all its dimensions.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase up to 2.50 meters, an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
Along with increasing dimensions, interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
The luggage compartment capacity - which has a double bottom system - is up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity of the first generation luggage compartment.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the engine 1.4, since the luggage compartment capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will feature two 1.2 and 1.4 litre gasoline engines.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre mechanics get a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 revolutions.
This propellant - which in former Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a capacity of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Regarding the previous propellant, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horsepower, now becomes 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horsepower achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that prevents collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, in particular, bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of the bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But most importantly are the bee’s composite eyes, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they have called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor which immediately results in collision prevention.
“At the moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and will immediately change direction by rotating its wheels at right angle or greater to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to prevent collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with just a couple of dozens of KBs of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about memory gigas, not even megas.”
This is the first step to developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the way.
Tremble before you mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of liquid for injections, is not devoid of wit.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a fun and informative browser game: ‘Bad Credit Hotel’.
I mean, the 'Hotel of bad credits'... or the troubles.
The terrific aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and even three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And most importantly, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
Certainly, it has useful information, but not detailed.
It’s more a teenage page than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is complete?
A dream room appears inside the hotel.
Something is something, because we don't even talk about buying a better house...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp fall in its stock market.
A week after discovering an interim deal, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley’s common shares at a unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the overall transaction would be based on a unit price of $29, which is 28% above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% at $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said Juan Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for nearly $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” explained Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, “we thought the stake would have been made up of only ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its accounting value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within a year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, or at $47 or so, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley says the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to capture investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group refused, however, to clarify the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had greatly eased his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been exhausting for the group, which saw its stock price fall in half as the cost of security against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost fell back on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, he is the third to put to the vote a draft for a new constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were voting null and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, half of the votes plus one had to be obtained.
On Sunday, two polls conducted outside the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory for the "yes", estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft constitution.
The “Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly,” he said, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, referred to a 444-point text that consolidated the " new socialism " defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies increasing the power of the State over the economy, reserving it for the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to foreign exchange that sends its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants reinforced powers to the head of state, who can hold up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and intend a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives under the poverty line.
It finally foresees a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
All 19 abductees have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been liberated by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good on their arrival at 3.30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft to the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown hijackers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they have passed from one zoo to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces members, carried aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight before dawn.
"An exchange of shots occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said the official who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of the secret services, of the special forces," he said without going into details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an off-roader on board which were the kidnappers, of whom six were killed, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also claimed that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), an assertion immediately denied by that group.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture made the headlines and occupied the current election campaign.
Better that way.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or starving national historical sites?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restoring only the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped into 211 history, heritage, archive and genealogy societies are concerned with searching in history, preserving with little money piles of private archives and preserving archaeological vestiges.
These are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and desperation when promoters and managers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a monument for history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The states of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization to the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has businesses in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at the highest level with the president of the European Central Bank and the head of economic competition of the European Commission.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer from the Eurozone crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves more than a year ago, so the decisions taken with regard to the Bank, in a sense, can be considered precedents.
According to the decision taken early on Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the Bank’s property in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a portion of its business, among them mainly the activities - mainly insurance - bought last year from Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis stocks started a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, this bank is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company's shares fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has declined by more than two-thirds.
Looking at current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management blamed the sharp drop in Fortis shares on the insecurity of the US market in connection with the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday, stocks showed a slight increase.
On Friday, they appointed Filip Dierckx as the bank’s new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they would not have to worry, they would not lose their money.
Among the Bank’s clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the banking offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, health and life insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when viewing drug purchase data.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which the use of prescription data in all cases unites it with the approval of the given person.
He must be in independent hands, because otherwise, “we trust the chicken coop to the fox” – quotes the Washington Post from Richard Dick, the designer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and the amount of compensation dependent on the client’s health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the client to medical check and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the check.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the diseases and health status of the customer.
For example, if you consistently take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a risk number, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has hardly anything to do, although there are small difficulties in it.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some drugs are multi-purpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk-increasing factor for insurance companies while the former do not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
The authorities are already obliging them to do this, although they have not received a fine for the negligence so far.
Some companies have also been developing laboratory test results and combining them with drug consumption data to gain more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
The bill that gives the right to the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another issue that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So that the hens, in spite of everything, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutual trade partners, this issue, in addition to the other mostly global issues, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, mainly to discuss cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, the member countries have yet to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at the ninth summit started yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Chair, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Javier Solana, the main representative of foreign policy, welcomed Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, that is to increase to more than one hundred billion euros, their trade exchange.
Bearing in mind that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
Thus they legally harmonised the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport can also fly in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the Union’s trading partners.
The summit paid its attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism – all forms of the latter – and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also urged, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, as at next year’s climate conference a global agreement should be reached and production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by fifty percent by 2050.
They also wish to impede rising food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - at a bilateral meeting - will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Show expects for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the show with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A meeting with the print will follow in the Room Struktur in the Buchmesse hall 5.0: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of the publishers in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors decreases progressively over the total of Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane found missing a year ago
The remains of the plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire missing on September 3, 2007, have been found while flying over the Nevada Desert.
The debris has been found on a high plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Nevada Mountains area of Mammoth Lakes, in the confinement between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wooden County Commissioner John Anderson said: “The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have confirmation that it is proper to what Steve Fossett was flying over on the day of his disappearance.”
The commissioner said no human remains have been found on or around the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was found dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squad of investigators has been sent to identify the device: it is own to Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named after Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, the sixth tentative, he had become the first Man to complete the turn of the world in a hot air balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the turn of the world by plane and without stopovers.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters in height, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and defined angles.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the "compact" off-road vans of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Owned by the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that accompanied the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central street of the Milanese shopping mall, avenue Como, until November 15.
The premium phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Successively, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will you be able to capture the interest of future buyers with this formula?
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that the Italian National has been following for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival’s fans either.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
A small group (few units, actually) of the Campaign and Apulia have been added to these from Sofia.
They have three-colored flags showing the city of origin of the militants: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of real Nazi fanatics, those of the Levsky.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among what had gone out for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) at the time, none that had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of stadium crime, were refused the ticket and also the trip.
Now the Ministry of the Interior looks forward to reading the incoming acts of the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents attending not only Italian stadiums but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't stand in a stadium anymore.
Thank you.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others be added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way," the interior ministry said.
That’s why, “the eyes are wide open” especially in view of Wednesday’s National match in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia holders.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams which can also count on a section of the Aise (information and external security agency, i.e. the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the raised arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a reaction ...."
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, since a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that before he was of Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste’s head of public safety where there is a core of holders of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not unreasonable to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans that has been shameful.
“I don’t make the sociologist,” adds the Observatory’s No. 1, “the reactions are attributed in the countries where the fact happens.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will consider it for the future.
But let us also talk about the whistles to the anthem of Mameli: these too are not a challenge, but if they allow, they are also not of education.
