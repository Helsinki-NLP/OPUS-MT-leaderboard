DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that naturally depends on once you get into a conversation, that you also talk with him about why he apparently felt one or the other as it is stated in his statement," Grindel said in the soccer podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung".
Despite the now months-long debate over the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case,” Grindel said.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it with the reason that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB chief reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He doesn’t want to build up pressure, but he knows it from football so that when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I find it a pity that this conversation hasn’t been made so far.
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergarten settlement burned
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire department in Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire upon arrival.
The roof had to be practically removed completely and fire scrap removed to the strictly necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had infected a battery for charging at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What did Lindsay Lohan do to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to take away the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live how she apparently wants to take the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Kissed to Happiness" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to identify as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family runs away from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses adults of child trafficking.
For all of this, she does not provide any evidence in the clip.
“The whole world is seeing this right now,” Lohan is heard in the video as she continues to track the family down the street.
Apparently she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses a slap.
With tears, the actress tells how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What motivated Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The probe "Hayabusa2" launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It is said to be so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Overseas ticker: death toll on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are reported.
The number of victims could increase further.
The rescue crews have not yet entered the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk Resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chairman
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla chief retires from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain CEO.
Congress of the British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the Party Congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum on a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name duplications for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and on this Sunday the population votes on it - is it okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The one who doesn't") - means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” gives himself as an anti-system candidate and is thus at the forefront of the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Labour Party.
Audi: “Dieselgate” work-up takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," development chief Peter Mertens told the Automotive Week.
In December 2017, detained and leaven Audi CEO Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would soon be disbanded.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gearbox combinations are expected to be tested,” he said.
Mertens said: “At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in working on the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was established in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and intends to continue discussions on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the exhaust scams became known.
He either knew about the manipulation or consciously ignored it.
Bram Schot is currently managing the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the change to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there are production failures at Audi, Schot told the "Heilbronner Stimme".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for sedans such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Schot focuses on electromobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already had 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to the DFB Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Ozil affair next year, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office again as DFB president.
"I do my job and I try to do it as good as I can," Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at the ZDF's "Aktuelles Sportstudio".
You have to try to get re-elected again and again, I will.
Then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it “wonderful” if he did not have “the pleasure to collaborate on the future project” after the tender for the 2024 European Football Championship.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as the successor to the overthrown Wolfgang Niersbach over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on September 27, 2019.
The future EM chief organiser Philipp Lahm is expected to cooperate in the DFB presidency, according to Grindel.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues on the Bureau agreed that he will continue to advise on the Board in this role in the future and then, of course, be cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migrant background would become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is carried out by the Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background is clearly involved in society and football and says, 'the issue is important, we have to take care of it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local clubs where integration needs to work," Grindel said.

A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat proportion.
Muscle and bone mass can also indicate it.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but that's more for the sausage.

Basketball Bundesliga: Clear kick-offs for Berlin and Oldenburg
ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Bundesliga basketball.
Against Science City Jena, the Vice-Champion won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an attractive performance in front of 9113 spectators during his compulsory debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the compulsory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with 24 points among the guests.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 counters.
Last year’s playoff semifinalist MHP Giant Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the most hit-safe shooter on the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
In the basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new game maker Will Cummings outperformed the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
Brunswick, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the start of the season, was disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the Cologne city centre had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were deployed, including snipers.
The Islam federation Ditib is criticized because it is considered a prolonged arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Cheers and Scary Seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have called for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in New York’s Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of some 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and gold microphone.
I’m nervous, I’m sweating, but it’s okay, because I’m here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also showed up on stage in the multi-hour show.
In the meantime, however, there was a frightening second when many spectators held the sound of a falling metal barrier for shots, became afraid and tried to flee.
Shortly there was a panic, people ran into disarray.
Seven spectators were easily injured, organiser Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed people down from the stage.
“Nobody is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were, as every year, free of charge on the Internet.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there was cheer and applause from the audience - buhrufe on the other hand for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, along with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons on stage, advocated for greater equality between men and women.
But on Friday, Flake had voted on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge, pushing many women in the head.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse, including the attempted rape of Kavanaugh, which Kavanaugh rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after confronting him with two women, who had reportedly experienced sexual assaults themselves, on their way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also come together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press Freedom: Federal Government Defends Journalist’s Expulsion
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended a journalist’s eviction from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
In the Chancellery Office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a t-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the front row.
The t-shirt was not the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disturbance in the course of the press conference.
The journalist’s action created a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he had the guards take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are imprisoned.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in forbidden parties or the Fethullah Gulen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not sure before the Turkish authorities: It was only at the beginning of September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
Although they were released and were able to return to Germany, there are still lawsuits against them in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and beautifully: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for moist conversations at the counter of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests on some beer, some wine or even higher-percentage drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities are also brave for the compulsory vocals.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Hottest Day".
The Municher did not get the trip to the high north at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed on it, his eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely depleted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - findings that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule Two: Never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also leave out.
Alcohol consumption is really written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broths, fish rolls or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nocturnal soup is not yet known.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, however, the 53-year-old seems to be significantly more tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and dirt
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway bike path in the Red Riding Hood country in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Shards, cigarette tilts, garbage and dirt, demolished garbage bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with a seat group to the bike path on the Haaße Hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the showpiece Railway bike path in the Red Riding Hood country a more than infamous sight.
The topic has been employed by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also by others for a long time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen, cycling traffic manager for the city.
The problem has already been addressed in the Cycling Advisory Board.
So far there is no solution.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seat group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the rule of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," Deserthagen says.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the issue to the local council.
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrations on weekends.
Not only does it happen loudly, but the parties are also destroyed: posts are torn out of the ground, garbage bins are demolished, signs are bent around, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path is clearly the focus here on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling manager, who now also takes care of the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
“If they do the same destiny, it will be very expensive.”
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this puts the threshold significantly higher to seize common property.
This would, however, presuppose that a police raid would soon pass.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes for a development of the Haaße Hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
The frequentation of the cycling route so far can be very satisfied.
Tourism marketing can still be expanded.
Our cycling path is very high quality compared to other in Germany," according to the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Asheröder Straße in Treysa as a very critical hazard.
There is no turning track on the Haaße Hill.
In heavy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between two-sided traffic flows," she explains.
This is not a problem for athletic drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Cultural Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in collaboration.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it soon became a family coexistence with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Cultural Station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived Albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, the ensemble from the Lugarten
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven’t seen it in other parts of the city yet.
What were the writers connected with?
In the towns, the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig cut the avenue in his bell-like song to the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also honored.
Time and again it was about the experience of coexistence in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew how to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest on the programme.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed all sorts of things on Youtube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury’s favourites – so that others could hear their songs as well.
A whole CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, which impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children appeared again to the final - and sounded "really good" even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, Hiltrup’s relationship, the melody’s comprehension and the recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverband and Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had initiated the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She regarded the event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil - only when you have put them in.
This ensures that the opposing party cannot read anything either by accident.
On the cards, for example, read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd dice.
4th party."
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
It is not the concepts, but the codes that are to be guessed here.
Alternately, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto" you should guess not the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cubes", "fest" and "windows" in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not as much as possible; because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor writes down and reads out loud: "throw" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prag" because he watched at school and knows the window crash there.
This is how it goes round by round, team by team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposite side - but they can better rim with every hint that the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too cranky, the conversions should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule booklet.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail before they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But if you’ve started, you’ll be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent topic on a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever is only about guessing and not about winning points, he can also easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greetings and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach Police Inspection twice on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper City of a passing police strip, later he also noticed in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In the sober state, he must then also be criminally responsible for the use of license plates of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers banged on buffers, you heard it all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes were also quieting and the wagons crashed.
It was a pure railroad.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel’s homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which after a climb of about 220 meters in altitude has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and draw blocks were needed in the past, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway operating workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, conducting and railway mastery.
"The heart was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich of Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway worker for 47 years.
Locomotives for the auxiliary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were also operated by the Bahnbetriebswerk (BW) Pressig, which was subordinate to Bamberg in 1968.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for train and thrust blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weighers were still ranked per month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were discontinued and the rest was discontinued in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that we have not considered a better use of the site, even in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous railway station festival in Pressig on the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here,” Georg Dinkel recalls.
A little later the out.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, and the ranger station Pressig was history.
"The Rangers and Shoe Reducers did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Every mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French woman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world rankings third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
He led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian at number 13 gave up.
The swan is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment" a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
With great ease, registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open grounds of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Rund um Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great visitor appeal showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
As well as Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
But with Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he placed his task in proven, young hands with a good future prospect.
In the past, both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and have contributed to the design of flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is again a special 70-cent stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
There, this year’s poster “Betzen austanzen”, designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high reception of the special exhibition.
For the musical framing, Max Marcus Stadler was won from Nuremberg.
Walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Happiness Tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in color, playfully provided with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushworks in the background, the object looks fairy-tale and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who is preferably devoted in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for wandering through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singer celebrates 50th birthday
1968 – that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albanians also gave air to their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to agree that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cacilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: On a bench in the inner bush they lifted the MGV 68 Albachten from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
“It’s getting full today,” chairman Jürgen Holstiege said, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
For the anniversary, they had revived the Foundation Festival.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the festival of tradition was back.
An elegant ball it was asked to festive clothes had been previously.
The guests did not sit as usual in the "House of Encounter" in rows of seats, but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was announced: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled on the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
The singers of MGV 68 Albachten made their own voices sound.
For the occasion, there were happy songs.
Almost already set: "A day like this, as beautiful as it is today."
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin name for "hope".
Again sovereign was the conductorship of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were then in the inner bush.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said: "He has such an easy kind, it's a masterpiece that he does." By the way, this time, not only men presented themselves singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire covers especially evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
After all, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds are intended to finance the children of the Albatros Youth Centre a visit to the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascendant is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really right in League three.
No trace of shyness or fracking, the independents do their thing.
And that in the 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
“It wasn’t crystal clear, but we’ve already left an impression,” says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was off.
Yes, the result is, in fact, an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it to the finish line, such a game can overturn," Büring knows from years of experience.
Eventually, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and brought the full yield to the finish line.
“We all know who’s on the other side in such a derby.
It doesn't break our necks.
I've seen really good volleyball in phases," Annacker didn't argue with the 0:3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents, seems unpredictable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
In the fourth league, they no longer want to look downwards anyway.
If the vest does not get dirty in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we will go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take place in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Dreamship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series may have been partly to blame for her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left for good.
The series that made her a star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many colleagues admired by me noticed me at eye level,” Keller told the "Bild am Sonntag".
At first, she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
“I don’t know if he liked it so well.”
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time might have been quite jealous, but "like many men, Hans also shuddered conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have adjusted myself," she continues.
She always felt like she wasn’t good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I never really was, even though I sometimes appeared to be rude and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously unsuccessful marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "though I was afraid it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I sat in the wardrobe crying and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had the love at the time "as imagined in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I’ve been too naive about love.”
The nightbird, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our fold is not a moth, but a little shy of light.
And the bright glow in which a green carpet is immersed in the Six-Sleeve Square, obscures it overwhelmingly.
But it is still a film festival, because more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening he twists over the square to ease himself briefly in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the need facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion puts a lot of effort into spreading a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it smells to heaven in the gentleman's oasis for some reason.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just entertained at the best level in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book", celebrate the festival start with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as you know, the works shown come from all over the world.
What do you not have to think of in an article about this festival, so as not to fall into covert advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The wrinkle binds a little ribbon around the feelers, which has attached a good fairy to him, and two bullish doorkeepers actually wave him generously in.
Inside, the guests rush, they dance to live music far after midnight or let themselves pretend by DJ rhythms to which they yell at each other, and flush down exquisite chops with Cüpli.
In the delicacy shop in the basement, oysters wait for snoozing mouths, next door, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is bubbling.
And the hammer is: all the shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The wrinkle studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If that are two separate instructions, he has lost himself in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it certainly has already saved lives.
In the household goods department upstairs, the wings tilt a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been advertizing for such a brand for years, isn't here that evening either.
But between local prominence, box-top and kitchen items, a face that seems familiar to the observer passes: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor is not far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, almost like a choir boy, walks through the crowd with almost sixty.
He isn't whispered, he's not gifted, he's barely silent.
Especially for this restraint, liked to be misunderstood as clutter, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dancing
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentine football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory from his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, excited by the players.
The Mexican second-leger had beaten the Leones Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted to a TV camera, "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Bundesliga 1: ASV Sending to last-minute play "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His defenders were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankrupt - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly for long periods, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "have we totally fallen asleep", the ASV coach was angry.
The owners quickly led by 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not at first fruit.
"Then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter.
At the break, the gap was only two more goals.
Above all, sending best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase a different time.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor’s point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst matched at 15:15, after which the season changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
What's up?
Take the impartial into action.
Bieletzki is usually careful not to blame others.
But: The 120-second sentence that Steffen Mühlhoff collected was “a joke.”
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, also stood well against seven men in the back and repeatedly threw on the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," says the fully-served Bieletzki.
ASV Gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Structures (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig after body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old woman from Naila (Country of Hof), the police are searching for the remains of the woman.
Rescue forces dug a street at Marxgrün on Saturday.
To this end, the road surface and several layers under it were removed, as police and prosecutors jointly communicated.
According to new findings, the missing person may have been buried not far from her then-residence.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working intensively with the prosecutor’s office on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Department of Monuments, the investigators encountered a noticeable situation under the road at Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officers confined the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the net.
However, users can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated strings of letters, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts on the web.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filed an out-of-court dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will each pay $20 million, and Musk will step down as Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German Supervisory Board.
The CEO can stay against it.
In the comparison, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not guilty.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed by the complaint.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he would perhaps take the company off the stock market and pay $420 per share, the financing being secured.
Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion in total.
Musk said Tesla would stay on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a chairman from outside, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk’s communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1:1 at FC Chelsea
FC Liverpool scored 1-1 for Chelsea.
In the top game at FC Chelsea, the attacker just switched by coach Jürgen Klopp in the 89th minute made the 1:1 (0:1).
After six wins at the start, Liverpool fell to second place.
Chelsea remain third, new leader is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard led Chelsea in the 25th minute with his sixth goal of the season.
After that, the Klopp team missed the balance several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger clarified after a solo of Liverpool's goalkeeper Mohamed Salah on the line (31st).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a sharpener in the corner.
Manchester United is slipping deeper and deeper into the crisis after the worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost to West Ham United with 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven days only in the midfield.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match against FC Valencia on Tuesday.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won by goals of Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th) 2:0 against Brighton&Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1:0, Ilkay Gündogan did not use the new leader.
"Let's Dance" juror Joachim Llambi and Ms. Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has divorced his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become famous through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhalinhalt) reports, citing Llambi's lawyer, about the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert.

46% don’t want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
After quarrels over the past few weeks, GroKo is collecting several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in an interview - Angela Merkel is critically viewed.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid-Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD adds a counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only get to 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the German parliamentary elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU together would only get 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
Thus, the large coalition has currently lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag elections, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
With the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, in several polls the second-largest party, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens have a vote of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The Left stands at an average of 10 percent, while the FDP stands at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the proportion of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the poll, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the big coalition to hold until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent is for a new election.
Another poll published on Saturday also showed a significant decline in Merkel’s popularity.
The Germans are also judging whether Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47% are for it, 44% against it.
64 percent of EU supporters want a candidacy, 35 percent don’t.
Aldi: Price Reduced to Love Happiness
Will Aldi be Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in Tinder's time there are no more romantic get-together stories - he should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket almost radiates an anachronistic romance as a meeting place for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxershort bargains at the wheel table or the favorite pudding is doubtless still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react, in the first message you do not talk for long around the hot porridge?
Here is the amazing result.
The right-handed Hollywood love story has the potential to precede love happiness when an out-of-the-eyes-lost-and-recovered plot.
If the guy still contacts his loved ones at bio-putenfleisch<0x40>gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this announcement in an unknown Aldi store that she will also wish that she will find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
For her belief in the magic of analog learning, she definitely deserved her happy ending in Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 covers for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has participated in the action "Cover against polio - 500 covers for a life without paediatric paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polio viruses.
The disease referred to in German as paediatric paralysis leads from paralysis symptoms to death.
In Germany, polio is considered extinct, but worldwide there are still three countries where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be curbed by vaccinations, according to a press release.
Soccer: Reus and Zorc demand calm for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about form and fitness of Mario Götze.
“We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn’t do us any good,” said Reus, a friend of Götze’s after the 4:2 win in Leverkusen on Sky TV.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of Bundesliga Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no rush in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven’t even talked about a contract yet.
There is no fixed date when we will do this.
"There will certainly be a moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sky TV.
Soccer: District League: Researcher's appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard to court with his own.
Wortkarg gave himself, the coach of the football league VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (inside) to think about the lack of performance on the green.
It's all history.
In the meantime, it is running around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrier’s record is the 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the last season only slightly crawled past the ascent.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked for each individual for the game, simply to say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in front.
Wolbeck had significantly more shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his (17th), the alternate Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost revenge would have taken place when the SCA in minute 41 was twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously hitting up in front of the Wolbeck box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his skill.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters barely failed.
Schroer too came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch of the left side missed a fresh cell cure again.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the landlords 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The bully went on himself and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right flap hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty more minutes, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather to his hand in the 80th minute unfortunately in the penalty room.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Bange Minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final stage before Geske had the winning score on the push in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, there was an accident on the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2:00 p.m. on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn came to a drama.
The landing of a helicopter resulted in turmoil, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was captured by a wind gust, burst to the ground and came to a halt laterally.
Immediately police, rescue and fire department were notified.
With a large order, the forces arrived at the accident site.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigation.
According to fire department spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, which, however, could be quickly extinguished.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8% of the executive board members were female as of 1 September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and was previewed by the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.
"The companies will have to look differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Wiebke Ankersen, CEO of the Foundation.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams – with a few exceptions – are far from conceivable.
The lag makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the share of women among German stock exchange companies was also due solely to positive impulses among companies in the Medium Value Index (MDAx).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8%.
Among the 30 Dax companies - a pioneer in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I'm sure that Dax companies will be recruiting consistent women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would continue to make no commitment to increase the share of “zero percent” so far.
On September 1, the share of women was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
“If equal numbers of women were recruited annually for board members, a share of 40 percent would have already been achieved by 2023,” the report says.
Some even make Miese: Luxury cars: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians earn 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This question was dealt with by "Autopopst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros in operating profit in the first half of the year with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put strongly on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of on average 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torchlight train for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
With a torch train, the tourist association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time the association organizes the wine festivals, which from now on rise every Saturday in October in the large festive tent on the Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, those responsible moved from Wiesenbronn through the place to the festival square under the sounds of the Spielmannszug.
In the already buzzing festive tent, the president of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "60 years of doing this - this is a mad achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that,” Starz thanked all the helpers.
The wine princess Lisa II later came from the stage symbolically with the guests.
"It's nice that so many have found their way to Abtswind again." Later, "Die Troglauer" created a mood.
On Sunday, when Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had fixed drink prices in the afternoon on the occasion of the anniversary as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest’s house, before it goes to the second round a day later in the festive tent.
In Bonn: Emergency car crashes in taxi
An emergency car is badly damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured in the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - best to save lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn took a deadly end for a 26-year-old woman.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in the collision of an emergency car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had crossed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then collided at a crossroads with the taxi that was driving at green.
After the collision, the doctor's car was thrown at a traffic light pole and a tree.
He captured the passenger who still died at the accident site.
Driver of emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be released from emergency forces.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called emergency doctor tried to do so, but without success.
The three severely injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the prosecutor’s office in Bonn, are investigating who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we feel uncomfortable
Manchester United are losing in the 7th round of the Premier League after the shameful end of the league cup.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat should still be talked about.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute when regained Marko Arnautovic scored 3:1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Having suspected an offside on the pass of Mark Nobel, all Manchester defenders stood still, allowing Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of previously insufficient performance over long distances.
At the moment, the mood is quite different at United’s Manchester City rivalry.
The citizens trained by Mourinho’s big competitor Pep Guardiola came up against Brighton & Hove Albion to an undead 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the home team’s defense for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former scorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer leader
Three days after the 1:2 loss in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri defeated Chelsea 1-1 with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the Cup-Out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The score of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only score of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, barely missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his slender.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp’s team in the cup, with the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City clubs celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2:0 wins.
However, the fans of the Gunners, with which Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a message of success against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unfortunately buxed Alex Iwobi into his own goal, just two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season goal.
Arsenal went past Watford for the fifth consecutive victory and is now in 5th place immediately after the big rival Tottenham. A strong impression continues to leave riser Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves were defeated 2–0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and took 8th place.
VW’s core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the wake of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not a topic but ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies release even at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week onwards, they will showcase their innovations in the French capital together with competition from all over the world.
Diesel doesn’t really play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which until then are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the shiny backdrops of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models, among other things: the e-tron of the Ingolstädter is expected to come on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
The BMW iNext is scheduled to start in 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be present this year from 4th to 14th October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there was a million visitors.
At least 380 people were killed in the earthquakes and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections were damaged, and enormous damage to property was caused.
After the earthquakes, the tsunami broke in over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the numbers of victims will still rise significantly.
So far, the figures are only from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking with a team of helpers on Sunday.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral care of PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle worship service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
Traditionally, the bikers celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, about 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to do anything but ordinary service.
Already from 10 a.m. the bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker-early sausage was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a strong curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was held during the biker service by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill was responsible for the musical underlayment.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests more poetic-quiet tones," said pastor Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle worship.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big feast: After the apple comes the milk
Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also attracted great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and showed his amazed spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely shredded mass.
Not many of the children could have imagined how it would turn into a tasty drink.
However, they were also able to see this important step of work on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer by layer, looking a little like chopped goods.
Thanks to some technical support, the last work step was not that difficult anymore.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorer farmer also had ready-made specialties with him.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented to the older visitors the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in fox turf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Activists of the Füchtorer comradeship of former soldiers also participated in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
Also next year, the home club will offer a day of action.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the theme: After all, it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season: "Fucking situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in succession, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 pros around him and encouraged them.
However, there was not much positive before in the 1:4 (0:2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and pushed on: "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The still unsuccessful Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met to follow, stand with two counters at the bottom and are a descent candidate in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, on the other hand, Frankfurt celebrated the first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored in front of 46,300 spectators the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who after the successful general rehearsal for the Europa League game against Lazio Rom with seven points in the midfield ahead of the table.
Croatia’s vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hesses during his start-up debut and never got control of Hannover’s defense.
The long-time striker after the World Cup showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable for the unity.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed from FC Liverpool, was also the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who started with buoyancy.
Lucas Torró (17th)'s header, faked on the goal net, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position in the last moment by the 96-defense for the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the owners of the house fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defensive corner, Haller prolonged by head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to stop his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender who came in the summer by French second-league AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt stopped before the break.
This time, Haller matched on his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully refilled himself and 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser gave no chance.
In the half-time, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxons now played a little bolder forward, but igniting ideas remained until shortly before the end, when the connecting hit was still successful.
The Hesses were much more efficient.
After just under an hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only running for the Frankfurter against overwhelmed guests, also Jovic hit one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
In spite of the cold temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, made it to millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two beats.
Geisingen: Geising Christians celebrate Holy Cross Feast
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Feast on September 14 or Sunday afterwards.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the Christ who was shot in the 30-year-old war and who is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From this, a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the service the procession to the Holy Cross church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the feast ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting the Catholic parish to the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon the parish still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction work that will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been standing for some time, the damages could be detected more accurately and the individual tenders prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago have become greater, but more has also been detected, which was only possible by the inauguration by means of scaffolding.
The base plastering work has been completed, before the winter the natural stone work is still to be started and one hopes to be able to finish well half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" will be handed over to its destiny - all present at the inauguration date agreed.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users, who have been living in the dormitory of the Life Help Donau-Iller for some time now, are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have taken into account Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first planning began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put to the test for residents with Handycap: "The house had come into the years and no longer contemporary in equipment," Bader said, looking back.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life support Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Around €4.6 million in life support was invested in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works have remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and finance.
He was also thanked by Jürgen Heinz, the Managing Director of Life Assistance.
The gap between a barrier-free and fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the residents to experience the freedom to move without the help of others.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile".
The comfort and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
"The property in this situation is a real luck, because it can no longer be acquired in the current situation."
In total, the new dormitory in the Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on nearly 1,500 square meters, divided into three residential groups.
Pride is Heinz’s life-saving managing director on the eleven full-time employees, all employed according to tariff.
Germany: Silent complains about differences between East and West
Before the day of unity, the deputy SPD Federal President Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to settle with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans on average worked longer than the people in West Germany, but would receive 15 percent less salary.
“I can’t explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after German unity,” Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is said to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
According to Moon’s office on Sunday, the two roughly one-year-old dogs reached their recipients as early as Thursday.
They crossed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to get used to it.
The dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the National Cultural Heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to jointly apply for the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile propulsion.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthhaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archive, writes this in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to material work - that is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU lastly did not mantraically invoke the "return to material work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and technical work, but let it be so.
Now that the federal government is ready to devote itself to its mandate again – to governing – it should not be deterred by debates of terms.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and blamas of the last few weeks will probably already show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the ruling parties meet in the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
But first of all, conflicting issues are once again on the agenda with diesel retrofits and the Immigration Law for skilled workers.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to get the car companies away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as obliged to technically retrofit older diesels.
While the diesel crisis marked an approximation over the weekend, Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned skilled labour immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "track change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be again disputes among the coalition partners - and how else should it be?
Not the same and the same has come together to the GroKo, but three partners with very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without disputes, a society so diverse, sometimes contradictory interests do not advance.
But in order to be constructive, disputes must not be raised again for partisan reasons on the question of being or not being.
It’s still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should argue, but always have people’s reality in mind.
What is feasible and benefits many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, this is what the People’s Parties must fight for now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in sight
Is the Minister of Labour violating the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" her legislators would have worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation two weeks ago.
With list mushroom mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) comes to astonishment - she now brings the matter to Parliament via inquiry.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and in no way to announce violations of current service law in front of cameras running".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to release Har tinger "from any suspicion".
Police open a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is dug.
The route is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was anticipated that the investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to limit the relevant place to a few meters, together with his guide, in multiple use.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, a ground anomaly was discovered in the area of the aforementioned street piece.
For more than a year, the prosecutor’s office and the criminal police have been working on the missing case.
A bicycle path was repeatedly blocked at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar devices, because investigators suspect that Heike’s body could have been hidden here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is celebrated for the first time.
But already before that there are riots.
The separatists did not forget the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police took place in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by proponents of independence, among other things, with color powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the civilian guard.
Around 3,000 police officers from the police units of Policia Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who were in the polls last year during the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
Attempts to prevent citizens from voting had also resulted in violence.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists then tried to break the police chain with force, throwing the officials, among other things, with color bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were easily injured, the authorities said.
The independence referendum will be held for the first time on Monday.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to separate the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, continue to be in U-carriage.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the inauguration of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Soccer: Oberliga Westfalen: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split torlos
Red-white Ahlen continues on the spot.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewald stadium, the final light and the third final light were found to be assembled in perplexity.
The first half was somewhat manageable by the entertainment factor.
Anyone who would rather get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without any worries.
There was no danger of missing a goal chance, because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Strikeman Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel was aiming just over the casing from 18 meters and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a shooting by Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
The swiftly presented counter about Sinan Aygün "kroned" Nick Flock (62rd) with a but licking shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball of Wieckowicz (66th), they fell after a corner ball of former Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and slightly later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahlenians did not achieve.
It wasn’t until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it didn’t make any difference either.
Angelo Daut then tried to remove the positive: "I like that we played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero also stood in front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as against Holzwickede and that although our opponent did not feel like playing here," said RW Ahlens interim coach.
Offensively, "everything was a bit of a bit" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
I didn’t feel like we could score a goal,” Daut said.
To his regret, however, as a spectator, it didn’t feel like his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Thanks Market: Fortunately there are enough creimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for whom these donations are intended, are pleased.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the space was still a little empty, but that was to change over the course of the day.
Because: "It's so nice sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent touch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who were supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creepers.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to entertain the more and more visitors musically in between.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at the late hour.
"Simply great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many active people with their stands, including mostly clubs.
“Actually, there shouldn’t be anything like a board,” he thanked for the action of the men’s choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all those who were in the booths and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful painting - here's what to do.
The cornice was then removed by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarter.
Many stalls were worked for the bodily well-being.
From sweet to hearty was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decoupier saw.
He had veneer work, beer lids with rectangular motifs and much more on offer.
One specialty offered three Reckenfelder beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschlüter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There little Elsa had to access again and again, so tasted the cake.
It is the sociability that allowed the visitors to linger for a long time until the evening, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with local political message: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknowns have advertised in a way that is unlikely to be conducive to the construction of a skate system.
There are similar lubrications in several places, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been charged with damage to property.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are displayed on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the professional election fair on September 19, a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro.
Since the short message at the time was apparently "only" left with an Edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, it was there again, this time sprayed," Rottmann said.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate system is constructed, its implementation will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of school, sport and culture, without mentioning names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that stand on the smeared board.
For years local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
In the end, the Council voted in favour of the firefighter parking lot.
However, this was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turnaround followed.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is given to the city council.
He assumes a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Congestion in air traffic control is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos this summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said the head of the Air Traffic Control Union, Matthias Maas, to the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight outages is the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic controls, for which there is no quick solution.
“Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new loods takes four to five years,” he said.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained solders has been swept empty.
Alone in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace, around a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, this will not happen without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German Federal Air Traffic Control.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for the Lotsen-Miser.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings for national air traffic controls are now fully passing through to the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to advocate in Brussels for regulations that "do not further restrict the air traffic controls".
Currently, the EU targets would be voted by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobby pressure from airlines.
“Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years,” said Maas.
He hopes that the high costs of delays will lead to a rethink among airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Service (DFS) offers a "vocal training and future pact", Maas said.
The so far announced annual intake of 120 students over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related dropouts.
The necessary staffing is not yet associated with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the wishes of Thyssenkrupp Interim Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board of Management at the meeting on Sunday, the crumbling group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to be headquartered in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in personnel beyond the already known reductions in administration.
After two resignations, the control body has only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees face it.
However, the final decision is expected to take place at a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50% share of the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business with elevators and supplies is to be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police officers and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence demonstrators.
The Catalan police have tried with a large bid to keep the two protests from each other.
According to the forces, however, proponents of independence repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and shotguns.
According to the reports, there were also rangelies between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescuers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to honor the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters perceived it as a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they ransacked us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the charge.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades, who did only their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues “have not come to provoke,” the policeman assured.
Panne Allowed Access to Personal Information of British Ministers
A security vulnerability in a mobile app has caused the personal data of ministers and MPs of the Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to anyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory Party in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hannover police reported a serious traffic accident on the 217 Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The forces are on the ground.

Soccer: Juve coach praises Ronaldo for best match
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best game this evening together with the half-hour of Valencia", praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) victory against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star was the decisive man in the important game against the chaser, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and does it well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal – and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo’s three goalsheets, Juve turned the game after the early setback by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hitting the worst chaser for the time being.
The goalkeeper picked up by Real Madrid initially placed on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who led with a double pack (26/49).
And after a corner by headball, Ronaldo also did the preliminary work to the goal of defense boss Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had to push just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," praised the coach.
But of course, Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team the record-breaking goalkeeper.
“We need to get even better at serving him,” the coach demanded.
Best Juve scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus’ superpower seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years has already six counters ahead of Naples.
Former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti coached in the league standings against Turin.
But at the latest, after Mario Rui (58th), who had already been cautioned, had been relegated to the top.
The Portuguese had to get in too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the place.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can could feel it too.
The German national player won at Juve.
The pro from Liverpool was in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo flew off the pitch in the Turin 2:0 victory and was banned for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West is changing his name.
With a particularly quirky appearance, rapper Kanye West has garnered attention on the U.S. TV show "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided for foreheads and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you can just call him "Ye," the musician said.
"The Being, formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted after the late singer Prince, who denied his artist name.
The pseudonym is not news.
The 10th album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe ‘Yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means ‘you’,” says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
It's done!
Hoetmar’s coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
This was a weak game for us today.
The opponent was just more grabbing, we almost never put him in trouble." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmarer shooting possibilities reads thinly.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, but the first one used Maik Krause from a sharp angle for the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after great preliminary work by Krause he turned free.
The hosts had only a double chance when Moritz Höne initially failed to score goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and in the downside Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all awarded.
A goalkeeper - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
“We had criticized each other hard before, which was different today than in the last few weeks,” Florian Kraus concluded.
Senderhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75th/Hoetmar).
Soccer: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spektakelfußball in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to say about it,” he argued.
"We didn't get access to them at all," he allegedly meant the wingclaw with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites who came up with a collective urge to attack.
He could laugh anyway: "A dirty victory," he said, blinking naughty and pulling away from there, on the other hand, his players were relieved to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Note, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class maintenance.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that were behind him.
“That was by far our best performance of the season,” he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2, how we hold against one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goalkeeper Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season goal (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He placed the 2-0 on the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"That was crazy what he did," Lewandowski admitted the opponent's quality without jealousy.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own eleven made the balance: McGill’s free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through the long toreck (45.).
After the change of side it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Despite the excess, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th).
We must now focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
“The game against hooligans, that’s what we have to win now,” Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74th/Album).
Soccer: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus
There were no winners in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Dynamo Dresden resigns its entire presidency
The entire presidency of Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
Several media outlets invoked a joint letter from the Saxony Board in the evening.
Initially, there was no confirmation from the association.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: politics instead of pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many thought he shouldn’t have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Celebrity Guests and New Offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 conferences by mid-next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: As Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there as a guest.
The director of the Academy, Udo Hahn, counted him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors have already been with us." The fact that celebrities appear at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker attends a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged: he wants to personally accept the “tolerance prize” awarded to him by the academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television host Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings by mid-2019 have it in themselves.
“Retirement isn’t safe!” is the title of a meeting.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
And to a meeting on Syria: “Barbarism without limits.”
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death – war derides every human idea.”
From structural racism in society, to the gap between rich and poor, to the radical change of work through digitalization, the spectrum extends.
“A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions,” Hahn said.
In a meeting of 200.
Karl Marx’s birthday is soon to be expected by one more visitors of the direction of capitalism criticism, the other more likely by a tendency “from the left to the middle”.
What about neutrality?
“We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church,” said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, “so we are not 100 percent neutral.”
Musical cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Church of Christ in Wolbeck.
As a cabaretist, Teubner knocked on gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used them and also mastered their violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was sitting on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: so congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely, the way it fits the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had put a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have emerged from Mozart’s composition if “the Nannerl” had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus, Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Song vom Tod", and from Mozart's g minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, to the Chansonette.
However, Chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea of giving the duo a treat in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain CEO at electric car maker Tesla, but must step down as chairman of the board of directors.
Musk also agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to pay a double-digit million dollar fine, the SEC said.
The background is Musk’s surprise announcement in August that he wants to take Tesla off the stock market.
The SEC accused Musk of making false and misleading statements.
- Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police corrected the casualty numbers slightly down.
10 passengers were injured instead of 15 passengers.
Everyone is now discharged from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released over the course of the day, a police spokesman said.
It is still unclear what caused the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal.
The long-distance bus crashed head-on against a guideboard on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems especially with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals alone.
"I was really happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We haven’t managed them,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
The focus in the final missed his team this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a lag, laying at the break at 11:12 and later still at 15:18 (45th).
Only towards the end did the wider bank of hostesses become decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu placed back room Merle Klement on the left, who then "extremely cleverly made the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd Women's League: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball women of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
In the second-league descendant VC Allbau Essen, the blue-whites won with 3:1.
“It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked out this," coach Dominik Münch was delighted after an almost flawless performance of his team in the overthrown leader.
The guests dominated the first passage almost as they pleased.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-master of the previous year.
Food accepted in the two-bar, but did not come into play.
We've been busy with her.
Our opponent has hit with high risk, but also produced many tickets.
In the second sentence the BSV led already at 12:8. "Eat has changed the adoption to three-bar.
We couldn't hold the pressure.
Food sucked up, and we let ourselves have a bit of a snack," Münch continued.
At 18:17, for the first time, the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their nose in front.
Although Ostbevern rejected four sentence balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," said the practice leader at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: “There we played consistently and calmly.”
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the Blue-White Passage brought four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had a great day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Community: Mosque Opening as a Missed Opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the Great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of shreds in the German-Turkish relationship that can only be arduously reconverted," said Gökay Sofuoglu, president of the TGD, to the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of side by side with German top politicians underlining the Muslims' affiliation with Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu said.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations".
Home club Nottuln: offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, it’s finally folk-meeting time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the home club Nottuln is already hosting its fifth Nottulner Folkmeeting in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost exactly the same day it was then a year ago that we held a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn’t have thought that our folk meeting would be so fast in Nottuln eta.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always full.
"The program at the next folk meeting is, as always, a colourful mix of German folk songs, hiking and sailing songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has pledged his accordion for the first Folktreff-"birthday".
He was a member of Gaitling for many years, a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt that played music with Plattdeutsche lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folkmeeting are happy to remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folkmeeting Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frosh in the Night" excited listeners and sent home with an earworm.
"We are counting on many cheerful guests to spend a social and humorous evening once again," says the invitation of the home club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The folk meeting starts at 7.30 p.m., but the entrance is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by October 24th.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde said on Sunday.
As a result, the billion-dollar merger still has to be approved in South Korea and – as the biggest hurdle – in the US.
Recently, the chances of an approval had improved, according to an insider, because Linde has pledged to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open issues must be resolved by October 24 for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit farming to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus gave the last impulses for the founding of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, at the time it was called another name: as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" it was raised from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today’s work – it was actually purely about fruit-growing, about flowers and horticulture at the time, no one thought about it.
"At that time, in the Enlightenment era, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," Günter Dippold, a district nurse, said in his festive speech.
Fruit trees should line highways, so-called industrial gardens were created in schools.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, organic plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a gardening association are on the stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The chestnut gathering was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a lot of joy with Smartphone & Co. similarly.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added Landrat Söllner, stressing the special importance of gardening associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, also left Friedhelm Haun no doubt.
He guided the many visitors with a picture presentation through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came from the garden, for the winter it was ingested.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden was transformed into a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature has survived, it was there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the expert for fruit and nut trees advocated.
That is why there is an incentive for the gardening associations not to give up so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
It was also important to welcome the new citizens to our clubs, added the President of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful celebration, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada’s foreign minister moves UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity on Nafta: they are putting both trading partners an ultimatum to an agreement.
Canada’s foreign minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority – and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the struggle for a new North American free trade agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, said spokesman Adam Austen.
In the meantime, she will focus on the re-negotiation of Nafta.
Mexico's economic minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada's and the US negotiators would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the US.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the regional free trade agreement Nafta.
U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They are now scheduled to be finalized by Sunday evening (local time), with the Trump administration planning to present the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of negotiations, Mexico’s nominated President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform in public in the South American country in the run-up to the presidential elections last week.
The politician was attacked on the open road during an election campaign in southern Brazil at the beginning of September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele no" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations had mainly called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, the associations mobilized racist and women’s despising statements against Bolsonaro.
Several thousand protesters were expected in the economic metropolis of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run for office.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As the former mayor of the million-dollar city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but recently presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieves an absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a referendum on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed from this - no matter who he competes against.
Bolsonaro is known for his rioting against gays and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he is shocked by verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula’s left-wing Workers’ Party should be shot.

After long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen told Larsen's website.
At the death bed Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become acquainted with the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music majors such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: volume at compressed air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger" Alone the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: hardrock pure from three other bands who were friends with one another.
After the soundcheck and shortly before the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and surroundings - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands will delight the about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night clearly.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with latest, unknown pieces of their own and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the coherent and powerful interplay.
Although "addition" calls are not to be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
That hard rock is not the same as hard rock, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich am Bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used in addition to the guitar rock in "Here We Stand".
Not only the craving, straightforwardly ballady "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, gained a special degree of prominence since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China of 2017 - is obvious and inevitable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann sets his own accents in the interplay with the band's only cover song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound felt even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a rejoiced solo, running through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume is part of such a hard rock concert due to its genre: At the "Mint Mosquito"- Rocknacht, the information of the mixing desk team at the three-part concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is for example at compressed air hammer level, but is thus still clearly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", which "The Ignition" points to on their website.
Ear-studding 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume as usual with the annual metal setting in the north of the republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, we have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say, though in the transferred sense, at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A death in a sailplane accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
In a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport, a sailing plane crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
According to the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a sailing plane crashed at the car park at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
According to the WAZ, the flight student was on board alone - the plane is said to be a single-seater.
At the time of the accident, the plane was already approaching the landing.
The crash site is located just a short distance from a festive tent on the airport site.
There has been an October festival this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr area cities and directly at the entrance to the highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump: “And then we fell in love”
It is no secret that North Korean President Kim is quite sane despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a true declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has announced a new flame.
The tragic thing: it's a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half as old sprout of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, even though the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament proves to be quite tough.
“I was hard, so was he, and between us it was going back and forth,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- Okay?
No, I really don't.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim’s announced halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
That the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - might not be more for everyone seemed to be quite aware of the US president.
Anyway, he took the expected criticism of it in advance when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How horrible, how horrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he doesn’t care very much about it, Trump said, then pointing his finger at the crowd: “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then there wouldn’t be 10,000 people out there pushing into this bumpy arena, we’d only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Well-visited, atmospheric and also full of sunshine: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's downtown has cleaned up on Sunday.
For the first time the Oktoberfest took place not only in the party tent at the fire brigade, but was extended by the trade association on Sunday to the city.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees, using a mobile phone video, have pointed out their disastrous detention conditions in Libya and thus enabled their rescue.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under threat of life and disseminated it online.
“They refuse to send us back,” a man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we would probably not have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life, according to his own statement.
One of his comrades was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
Generally speaking, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year, said IOM spokesman Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians now rescued is not unusual in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
He has not yet heard of a phone call for help.
International organisations have long criticized the situation in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants en route from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the primary school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front room of the first floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase into the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police who began the investigation.
Whether things or money were stolen is not yet known.
Description of the perpetrator: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark t-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg am Inn Police Inspectorate, telephone 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in central Franconia after he stuck the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday night, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The retiree had been reported missing by his family after he did not return from a ride by his off-road vehicle through the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man’s whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet warns of the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own information, warned the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This mainly concerns waves of arrest, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to be normalized in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also reportedly addressed the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan reiterated the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been transferred at short notice to a flight-ready building of the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan went on to open the Ditib Mosque in Cologne after the talks.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact person - not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump does not tire of stressing the successes in denuclearization negotiations in North Korea, the East Asian regime presents the conditions more soberly.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington to respond.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government in the UN general debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
“The recent standstill comes from the fact that the US is relying on coercive measures that are deadly to building trust,” Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
The fact that sanctions could “force North Korea on its knees” is “a dream of desire for people who don’t know us.”
However, to build confidence, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.
However, there were no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Due to North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council adopted sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have urged strict compliance with penal measures at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea’s Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on terminating the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing from it: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had our refrigerators filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were perfectly prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power outage had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
“Now we had to start all over again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone,” Westbuer said.
And so everyone got along.
The result could be seen, the guests were delighted.
“It’s not better for cooks either,” a visitor praised, while hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their legs," emphasized pastor Frank Beckmann, while wizard Stephan Lammen was amazed with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board of directors NRW der Tafel
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has given up his post in the national association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He resigned as deputy head of the NRW panels in July, Sartor told World on Sunday.
Too many fell in my back.
The head of the NRW Tafeln-Landesverband, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed to the dpa an understanding of the decision of his long-time deputy.
The sharp criticism took Sartor with it.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who did not know exactly why the Essener Tafel does this."
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes", Weilerswist said.
Sartor criticized criticism of colleagues from other panels in the "Welt am Sonntag" in turn.
One should not follow the approach, "without us the people in the city will die of starvation".
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not attend a conference of tables in Berlin on Friday.
"I'm being told too much sweet pussy," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies who criticized me so much back then.
SF Lorch play 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Soccer, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after lag - Bettringen strikes Lauchheim clear.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports fans was great.
Very different from TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB could meanwhile with a 3:0.
Gladbach playful twice lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an away victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke wins against Mainz for the first time (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke maneuvered away in the first five league games with early goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco once again showed the strength with which they had taken the first place behind Bavaria last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Yevgeni Konopljanka per head, in the aftermath, the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is greeting again from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated a 0:2 draw against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to a 4:2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) matched with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, with another doublet in the final phase (86th/94) ensured the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The first victory was also won by VfB Stuttgart.
The Stuttgarters had to panic against Werder Bremen already before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in goal that helped the guests compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a lead twice, ultimately played 2:2 and have been waiting for a away victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for compensating for Wolfsburg's 1:1 win with his second Bundesliga league.
In the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauers, Yann Sommer was powerless, just as in the second strike after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalkeeper in the storm of foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from OGC Nice hit for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven laps, Gladbach took fourth place.
Within 40 minutes the previously unsuccessful Werder Bremen maneuvered against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable situation.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first season goal, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued his team: the 23-year-old Serb cashed after a jersey cup against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Red.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen back into the game by a curious throw-in goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the overlying Stuttgarters back on the victory road.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly for itself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million people vote on whether to change the name of their country in northern Macedonia.
With a yes, the nearly three-decade-long conflict with neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach by Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future integration of the West.
The U.S. had announced that the country could quickly become a member of NATO if the referendum was successful.
Syrians in U-detention.
A refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian beat three pensioners brutally and injured them in part severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had raided the escape alley in Alsergrund at around 10 p.m. on Friday.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went off on passers-by with clasped fists and tried to attack them, about his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
Shortly afterwards, it turned out that the suspect had just before in the Währinger Straße at a tram stop three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured “for an unknown cause,” as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored continuously during the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage entered into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, the two gave their voices to each other in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership was not in question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, that's right." He's been dating his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused a rage on June 30, 2017.
He accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of “stumping” on the issue.
“That was your Schabowski moment,” he said, referring to Günter Schabowski’s accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
As of October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as in the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Citizens' Association Children's House and the Society for Leprosy.
Because about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfündnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, about twelve supporters went to work.
“We are doing this to reduce costs,” said Walter Schröer, chairman of the Citizens’ Association.
And so much has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it is now just a shaped cut.
Because already in the spring the hedge had already been shaved.
The breakfast always following the work also has a long tradition.
"Let them all stay on their feet," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at Canoe Lalom World Cup
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg has won the gold medal at the end of the Canoe Lalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago he had missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I had enough rides here on the site and everything worked out today," said the Olympic third of London 2012.
At the finish he threw his paddle away from joy and stretched both arms up safely – knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had starting number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec was second before the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempted burglary in a single-family home this fall.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what burglars want to take advantage of again.
For example, the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported yesterday the first attempted burglary this autumn.
The fact that it remained in the attempt at the detached house on Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The thieves knew that the residents were not at home.
But the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they fled without prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Bankruptcy at Hertha: caught by reality: Bavaria demanded against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants FC Bayern "not to be pleased".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small power dish under the new coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase for the Munichs to the greater autumn low.
“A week ago we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now the reality has caught us a little bit," Thomas Müller said after the deserved 0:2 loss at Hertha BSC and called for a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and we are therefore giving gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal was scored, as at the same time of the pre-season two compulsory games in series without victory, the lead in the football Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, nevertheless the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg in the 1:1 with its loud man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last seemingly overpowering Bavaria are to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not be pleased with this and we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he and his losers in his hometown went surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the again poor dealing with opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim fact of his term of office positive - otherwise the tone is likely to intensify.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second royal class appearance this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary game against Ajax begins as planned, which at the start of the AEK Athens also had a 3-0 victory.
"Now it caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
Just as after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The right-wing defender appeared in the role of advocate.
"I don't think this is all bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind it," the 23-year-old said just before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were already behind Dortmund with five counters, which has now taken the lead again with a point.
And so Kimmich rated at least positively with a wink that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
“Yes, that’s good,” said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Shooting Line: Özil-Cause: Sharp Attack by Erdogan on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the line of association.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent dispute theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president severely criticized the dealings with the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
Early Sunday morning, the Grindel, personally sharply attacked by Özil at the ZDF "Sportstudio" in Mainz, announced consequences from the Cause.
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migrant background in the U-teams - that such a thing does not repeat itself," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He denounced with sharp words a racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Born and raised in Germany, Mesut Özil and Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England,” Erdogan said Saturday in the cathedral city.
Honestly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who ascended to the German national team, were marginalized.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future.
Someone says, “If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am migrant – that’s not possible.”
“I am very sorry that he has such an impression,” Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
In conclusion, an additional integration commissioner will be appointed alongside Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background is clearly involved in society and football and says: 'The issue is important, we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local clubs where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Ozil affair, he intends to run for office as DFB president again next year.
“I’m doing my job and I’m trying to do it as good as I can,” Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Initially, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red lights in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
She told the retiree that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange, as the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had walked off the road and driven against a guide post.
The man did not want police on the ground and then drove away.
Afterwards, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the retiree in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, has proceeded and when turning a construction vehicle framed.
Eventually, the police could find him and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confusing impression and couldn’t remember many things.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still nearly 1,000 operational forces in operation.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 forces are still employed with the extinguishing work.
That was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop steadily, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of troops is planned, it said.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week the catastrophe, which was proclaimed well a week earlier on September 21, had been lifted because of fears that the flames could endanger adjacent forests and settlements by wind and spark flight.
Thursday, it was said, a crossing of the fire to neighboring communities is no longer threatening.
At times, more than 1,500 forces tried to get the large fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site in Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, for October 2 and 5, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the moorbrand had been pulled at times up to a hundred kilometers far beyond the northwest of Germany as far as Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr plans to set up a contact point that will receive damage reports.
The first claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage entered into force for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage entered into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, the two gave their voices to each other in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership was not in question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
If we get married, that's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused a rage on June 30, 2017.
He accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of “stumping” on the issue.
“That was your Schabowski moment,” he said, referring to Günter Schabowski’s accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
As of October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as in the right of adoption.
Macedonian referendum on new state names
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the same name the neighboring Greece.
As a means of pressure, for almost three decades, Athens had blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the start to the western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The Author Who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting

The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the United States in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Holocaust for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The registry is designed to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still be removed only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant stresses.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your requests can then be obtained from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant stresses.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card is found at the decisive moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Center for Health Education says, Marita Völker-Albert.
“There is no register in which people can enter their wishes – for or against organ donation – there is no register,” she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has advocated a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered an organ donor, unless he or she objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head counting
14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in head counting.
He defeated 39 competitors in Wolfsburg this weekend.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, announced this on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retiree from France, chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were there two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or miracle child, organizers can start a little.
"Head-calculating can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-based computational competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates get surprise tasks, for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have a good chance, the main referee said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because in early childhood head computing is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans to significantly expand the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called “Symbols Law” in review.
This is intended to significantly expand the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes out her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at a strong intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start annual knee care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers are allowed to start their annual knee care on Monday.
For about 200 years, the unique "green forests" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forested state.
The up to five-metre-wide tree and scrub peaks are "Waldersatz" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats over which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the German Conservation Federation (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and livestock fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
Its name "knick" also comes from that time: by "bending" the branches could develop the dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, about 45,000 kilometers of hedges extend and give the image of a woody, variedly structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7,000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
In one kilometer bend, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise, it turns into a light row of trees, which in addition to biodiversity also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, bend care may only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian speaks about situation on site
In an interview with the Editorial Network Germany (RND), local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were over, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which are completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we provisionally set up something where we also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have raced on surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing outside their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people steal some food and gasoline.
The public service is shut down completely, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, prisoners are partly running free and finding them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before this did not work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they do not know if they live and where they are because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but on the way to work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
There are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and we also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had to pull a muscle fiber tear in the back left thigh in the 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga said on Sunday.
At Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss matches even after the following country break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast on the downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals slightly faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival

On Sunday morning, the firefighter Olching tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action slowed down for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers on Lake Olching spotted a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the firefighter was able to encircle the animal and push it back on land, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a brave handle.
The duck injured in the chest was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard wins World Cup medal
Fourth at the Olympics, biathlete Julian Eberhard was in his stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up with the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the closest medal.
Seven tenths of a second was missing on bronze.
"I consciously gave myself time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn’t want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back with the constitution to a major event, to win something.
At some point, you also have to strike.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is located Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart", he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only single win for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass launch competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season he ran to second place in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo speed
The time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at turbo speed, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure a thin majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh on charges of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set investigators a deadline until Friday to investigate the more than 30-year-old alleged incidents.
The recent turn in the drama around Kavanaugh’s vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and first-time prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in which the lawyer issued angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was supposed to pave the way for the final confirmation of the conservative Supreme Court judge.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, suddenly declared that he would agree but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called Thursday’s heavy remarks a “shock,” initially abstained from further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of “happiness in misfortune.”
In this way, last doubts could be removed, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for refusing Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely restricted investigators’ powers.
They will be investigating the known allegations of two women, no more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile, installed in a "civil vehicle" radar device of the municipality of Ried for monitoring the speed limit is stationed on the Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1st, according to the municipality of Ried.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The city also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: The fear has been felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first victory of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
However, against Mainz, the factor time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room," said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the Königsblauen were still able to bring the scarce 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under control.
In fact, it could have happened differently.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 gave the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security: "In sum, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing", with increasing duration of the game, the head obviously played more and more a role.
Actually not a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours to me," Heidel said, "if the team were only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore retreated further and further.
And with man and mouse defended against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant share of it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the team."
In the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start in the initial phase with pressure and make a firework of it,” said Schalke’s chief coach.
Victory was important.
We can finally be happy for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and bravely, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a tremor victory," Tedesco said: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
So I’m glad we won.
He wasn’t the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not overlooked.
A walker from about two kilometers away observed a fire in Leitzachtal on Sunday at around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found out: An unknown man had set fire to garbage on an area of two square meters on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it looked like he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the heat unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating fire.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them stands the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task for many years to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Culture Policy" in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, fixed numbers and jokes, he brings listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, the first generation migrants at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to decide.
This leads to conflict.
It is therefore not decisive whether you are politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?"
In the beginning, the discussion is more and more active.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee tells from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani presents, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "until we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the ensuing signing lesson, he still had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and Pouring Win
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away victory.
Gießen prevailed in a hard-fought game in its own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had significantly more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won on Saturday the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the new construction area Landsham-Süd on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick said.
In addition, the application phase has been completed for the 20 plots that the municipality offers at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
Around 100 applications were received, Frick said.
"The documents are currently being examined", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieninger, it is the goal that by the end of the year the candidate ranking list for the 20 plots has been drawn up and presented to the municipality council.
After that, the award can be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family homes with expected eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
A single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 housing units funded by the Free State.
Room for 200 people
A rough estimate is made on the area of the new construction area Landsham-South housing space for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the new construction of a daycare center takes place there.
It will house three kindergartens and three groups of nativity scenes as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalkes Naldo succeeds in "great sport" on the bench
For the third time in a row, not in the start eleven: Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf but on the replacement bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-metre-old Brazilian had spoken the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco to all his pros, the 36-year-old, who all call Naldo for the sake of simplicity, turned in and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction to his deputy captain, who had no resentment despite his renewed reservist existence.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalker last season, knows that he has actually not gotten on a stand-up track with his coach - but gets a break for good reason.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn’t easy to tell him that.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco reported the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” Tedesco said.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It’s important that everyone can go through it nowadays.
And to keep all of us in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which also caught Naldo recently.
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to accelerate its descent compared to the eurozone in August.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was 46.7 points below a 37-month low.
Austria still has the third best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday about its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still below the mark of 50 counters, which indicates growth for the 13th consecutive month.
Only Ireland’s industry broke this threshold in August at 50.9 points.
The final result was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March at 44.0 points.
"While the slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst has survived," Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
However, the industry remains the number one growth brake – in the third quarter at least.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as sharply as since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
Also in China, industrial production fell more than initially assumed in August.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
These include developments in sales, employment, stocks and prices.
Tuchel's PSG team wins eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel races with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship from victory to victory.
At OGC Nice, the title defender won thanks to two goals from Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus successful in the eighth league game.
Recently, Olympique Lyon in France had made such a good start to the season 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar put PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and set the final score in the post-match period.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) had a 2–0 victory.
Paris also managed the general rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the royal class, Tuchel's team had to take the only compulsory loss of this season in the 2:3 in Liverpool.
