Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, according to the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 extinguishing vehicles.
The fire could be stopped.
Neighbors were called on not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory is part of the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive, the EU's strict safety regulations.
Around 400 people are working at the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when methanthiol escaped in 2013 through a leak and the environment smelled far after rotten eggs. In 2015, after an operational accident, some 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the wastewater system of the city.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing bitch for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days lacked any trace of the bitch - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left the bitch Katie in the hotel room while they went out for dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
The dog was panicked by thunder.
In the hopes that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, 'She left about four, four and a half hours ago,'" Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Probably a loud thunder had caused the dog to panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned to weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a phone call: A man called in and said that Katie had been in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered, according to "Daily Inter Lake, the people stayed out of her car.
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost many weapons and tens of thousands of shotguns, including three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" scale.
Weapons and ammunition are constantly disappearing in the Bundeswehr - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 shot ammunition. This is shown by a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which the editorial network Germany reports about.
According to the paper from the office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two guns, one gun part and 3474 shotgun ammunition have so far reappeared. The weapons and parts of weapons still disappeared are among others six machine guns of type MG3. Eleven machine guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns of type MG3.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was found to be "frightening", said the Left Bundestag MP Martina Renner. "This was all the more true, since in the course of investigations nothing had been found. The Left politician spoke of a "poor balance". Renner criticized the fact that the list was not recognizable under the investigation.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. According to ship observation data from Refinitiv, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. The destination port was Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters at first. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official notice from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was charged on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the Highway of Hormuz on charges of breaching security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial, temporary arrest of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Britain's Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region had escalated immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers.
Merkel pays tribute to people’s courage in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has commended the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In autumn 1989, courageous citizens would have shaken the GDR regime then, Merkel said at a festive act of the Thuringian CDU faction on the imminent day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor said the "Statraen-re said among other things
Musk seeks a record for extradition
Tesla's quarter may hold a record, but despite a delivery boom, there have been recent losses at the electric car group.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could record 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter said. The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly. To do so, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went trading with an increase of more than 6%. The price has not so strongly increased for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered more than 95,000 cars, reaching its previous peak.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures will be required in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found this with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children are so fiercely resisting tickling, only to then demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why it is only the approximation of a tickling hand that triggers laughter even before touching. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebellum that triggers laughter even when the tickling is expected.
According to reports, previous research showed that rats react with "laughs" in the ultrasound area when tickled by humans. This "laugh" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves as the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-contact
So far it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touching and touching by others - that is why humans cannot tickle themselves. However, in the experiments on the rats, the Berlin researchers have now found that laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during self-touching. This is also the case if the living beings in the tickle themselves and in the tickle themselves.
However, if self-touching and touching by others at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between self-touching and touching by others. The new findings suggested that humans cannot tickle themselves because self-touching activates a brake in the cerebellum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. In doing so, they sometimes stopped this initiation in the experiment prematurely, exhibiting flight behavior or scare stiffness. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster avoided: Great fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, the Normandy prefecture told AFP news agency on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to authorities, no harmful substances have leaked. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 extinguishing vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were told not to leave their homes, buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.
Factory owned by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett’s Lubrizol Company
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The plant is owned by the Lubrizol company of U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements. The plant employs around 400 people.
The chemical factory already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methanthiol escaped through a leak and the environment smelled far after rotten eggs. In 2015, after an operational accident, some 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the wastewater system of the city.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in parliament after the forced break was lifted on Wednesday evening. The prime minister threatens to lead the country on October 31 without an EU deal if Brussels does not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
On Cox, who had advocated Britain’s stay in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: “The best way to honor Jo Cox’s memory and re-establish this country would be to complete EU exit.” Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya Attacks Revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims is unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of around 1,000 iron rose replicas. They recall the roses that had been laid by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
The project by the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be unveiled in the same place. The roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Among others, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to open.
On July 22, 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first detonated a car bomb in the Oslo government district, and then, on the island of Utöya, he killed dozens of participants in a youth camp of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, a total of 77 people killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to take off again. It could be a piece of puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Rouhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk informed.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now sailing to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said shipping chief Erik Hånell. At noon the ship had left Iranian waters. "It is nice that it is over," he told Swedish TV station SVT.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to compromise the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law," the statement said.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker on 19 July on charges of disregarding their maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are well according to the circumstances, Hånell said. They would have been able to return to work quickly in the face of the difficult and irritating ten weeks of their past situation.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar after the establishment of the "Stena Impero": in early July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, supposedly destined for Syria, had been chained there. The delivery violated EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Suspicions that it was a barter deal to get the "Stena Impero" released, London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington lies the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The US alone had withdrawn from the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which should stop Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time extending its political and economic isolation to the territory. Since then, the US government has strictly opposed the leadership in Tehran with massive economics.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for the military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York, with the initiative “Coalition of Hope” for the Persian Gulf to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protective powers.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war-winner"3. Given the newly imposed tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, billions of people in the U.S. do not seem to be able to play a role in a trade union, but foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-dispose themselves.
But now India itself is in Trump’s focus. Degrading by the Haudegen in the White House as “Kingdom of Tariffs”, America deprived the emerging market of trade benefits for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the frictional struggles with India are, of course, only a side-stage. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also through the security glasses. Delhi and Washington connect the concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvage of American fines against India is unlikely to emerge as a second period. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets seem to accelerate economic development, in the socialist republic of India, has a severe state of affairs. Even under modes. His reform zeal is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that in the multi-population state willingly suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit and now get a faster company to benefit from a construction.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has turned for the better in India in the first five years of modes. However, this does not apply in trade policy. Inspired by protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign providers, the national conservative government has even erected new barriers.
In the West, modes of the energetic reformer’s nimbus politics depend on the fact that the country is forced to be economically radically renewed, thanks to the fact that the country’s people are not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well which vocabulary Western managers like. At the core of the “India First” advocate, however, the “India First” advocates never depart from a protectionist economic policy.
Jacques Chirac's funeral in Paris on Monday
Former French President Jacques Chirac is said to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the cemetery of Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported, citing the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. For Sunday, a public mourning ceremony was reported in the Parisian media dome, according to the news agency AFP.
Supported by competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championship
The top of the world had long been in the finish when the forces were not going to stop in the chilled down Khalifa International Stadium, but in the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby started to fluctuate dangerously. He could hardly hold on his legs well 300 meters before the goal, ran in an unhealthy leaning posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo would have reached the last target under the target of the West African country Guinea.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, "when he totally unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. He just shyly walked out, didn't want to talk about his heroic deeds at all. After all, he wanted to put up his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he just wanted to be proud of the country's.
That evening he did it with great emphasis - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this heroic deed will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even let his competitor Busby take the lead in the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. It had been used by the end of the busVersade.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying in Lisbon, competed for a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes before". However, only in training, because best times do not count.
Millions of Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been tightened in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. The police presence in central Cairo was increased on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
In recent days, police had tightened their road controls and searched pedestrians’ mobile phones for news and photos related to the protests, with hundreds arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, although it had come to protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, the young boys who had come to the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs of the suburbs.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued, according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures were also not confirmed. The government did not confirm and did not confirm the figures at first.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have been "accidentally arrested" "only because they were "at the wrong time in the wrong place," HRW said, citing lawyers of detainees. The accusations against the detainees range from "proliferation of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association" in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country, according to which the government is blocking websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Shipping retailers should be able to donate returns easier
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although companies could not be exempted from sales tax on donations in kind, the ministry said on a question from the Greens' parliamentary group, which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday, but merchants could put the market value of the unsold returns so low that they would have to pay no or little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens return every sixth parcel when ordering online. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then ended up in the trash. Donating would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the tax authorities evaluate donations in kind as a turnover, which then incurs sales tax.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies can not sell products accordingly and donate free to non-profit organizations. Companies would have to be able to rely on not to be punished for donations. This applies not only for online construction, but also for other shops.
Banksy Art at Auction: There Never Was a Better Time to Sell This Painting
Streetart-star Banksy’s Devolved Parliament is set to be auctioned off soon.
For Branczik, Banksy’s work underlines “the restoration of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic poses of animals and tribes.” The painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby’s in the British capital from Saturday until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated to be 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in southwestern Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard blow to the opposition at the first meeting of the lower house after the Supreme Court lifted a forced break imposed by Johnson. Johnson wants to carry out the already twice postponed Brexit on 31 October if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in southeastern England, he painted a picture depicting a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. The factory sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a “walk in the park”
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the campaign ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a “walk in the park,” Dominic Cummings said at a book presentation on Friday. “We will be enjoying it.”
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days, accusing them, among other things, of "treason" to the people. Allegations that he could put MPs in danger because they could become targets of murder threats, he dismissed as "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to rest is if MEPs finally respect the British decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people are upset that Britain has still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In the face of the upheaval, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should talk to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistani Prime Minister Khan Calls for UN Intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If this goes wrong, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn autonomy from the Indian Kashmir region and thus increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government reacts with a hard hand to the current protests in Egypt. It has fired on the population with sharp ammunition, more than 2,000 detainees join in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who already reside there. Protesting in Egypt has never been harmless. But since the seizure of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to the Spring of the State in 2013, a Sappar does everything
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions into the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi cannot handle, no matter how hard it goes against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today one in three people in Egypt live below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has always lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is already ten percent. Who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, must decide who it finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the biggest economic actor in the country. The military has been building a lot of houses in the country.
TÜV exams in terminal: BER-Chef: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
Two months of checking whether the complicated system mesh in BER fire protection works together. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet ready at BER.
After large-scale TÜV inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year, for sure, said Rainer Bretschneider, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, after a meeting of the Control Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal to work out. "We have many details, but we do not have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction ready-made advertisement is now to be submitted to the Bauamt during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables have yet to be fixed, and the Tüv intends to examine them by February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work must continue to be done to remedy the deficiencies," it said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there is a lack of evidence, less new cables. There is also no release for all plugs on which the cable tracks hang. The airport manager expects that they will be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not yet work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that shut down in a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They go down too far. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there should be new trials with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Costs have risen from two billion euros since the start of construction in 2006 to around 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly, the officials are planning to expand the airport. That is why it is planned to take place at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance chief Heike Fölster is switching to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen is retiring next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put airport finances on a solid footing.
Chemnitz: Machines for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and for this he shot several vending machines in the area of Chemnitz city! Now the perpetrator is finally in prison!
In the last two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines blown up in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police seized a 33-year-old German woman on the Bürgerstraße and Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the instigation of explosive explosions in the deed unit with a particularly severe case of theft carried out by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, this suspicion against the 33-year-old was not only confirmed".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman said: "With the prey he apparently financed his addiction to narcotics." The bomber alone had blown up parking lots on the Bürgerstraße four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60,000 euros!
The machine bomber is now under investigation, and police investigations are ongoing.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further machine explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price struggle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", a press spokesman for Austrian Airlines confirmed on Friday to the APA.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa-Billigflieger Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Four of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be deployed in Salzburg, which will be taken over from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter engines to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesperson explained. The flight times are to be coordinated for connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub on the one hand and on the other hand to expand the decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings serves in Vienna only as a "production company" for the sister group AUA. Thus, among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. The onboard product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants are from Eurowings. The pilots and flight attendants are not as follows in the AUA flight number 1, Eurowing.
A price struggle broke out at Vienna airport after the Niki-Pleite. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday to increase the fleet in Vienna next summer to 16 aircraft. The Irish low-cost airline sends four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlekrit".
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's battle announcement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, replied on Friday, AUA CEO Andreas Otto: "We remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years."
Queen granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four marries. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped in the Italy holidays at the beginning of the month for the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31).
“We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement, we are both so excited to begin this adventure together and can’t wait to actually be married,” the couple, who have been together since October 2018, said in a statement.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the years to come full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and posted on her Instagram account.
A Royal Feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information on date, location and everything else will be announced in the coming months.
But it is certain that the wedding of the number nine of the British throne succession and the real estate mogul will be a similarly big celebration as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a closer look at the genetics of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analyzing the genetics of 9,000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out more in detail the causes of cardiovascular disease.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the high mountain hospital Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy diets are among the major influential risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients at the University Heart and Geriatric Fat.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to cause possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations -, the clinic said.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for preventing, detecting and treating heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other folk diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings on the interplay between heart and brain are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is a strong will to use the data also for the exploration of other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos so far mainly deals with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created on the medical campus there and a professorship of bioinformatics should be established in Hamburg.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world. In the genetic decryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data from the University of Zurich, said Holger.
According to UKE, the genetic material of a human can be deciphered within 24 hours today. The pure material cost for it would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing in the world, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to begin on October 1, as early as the end of 2020, all 9000 samples are expected to be analyzed. The first results are expected by the year thereafter.
Nigerian police release hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. According to locals, security officials searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the minor victims, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them said they were raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Qur'an. In fact, the protégés were held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions", Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
The Koran school had been in existence for about ten years, according to reports. Residents had been alerted to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents were shocked when they were told about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled the border to the neighboring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and Tortured: Nigerian Police Release 400 Children from School
“Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture,” said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
The children were found there on Thursday after a hint at an Islamic school, where the conditions were "inhumane". Officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held as slaves at their school and chained. Some were sexually abused. Television footage showed fattened and injured students in a noticeably poor state of health.
World soccer elections: Further allegations after Messi and Klopps Kür
Football "signature not valid"
Jurgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Soccer Association has awarded the best player of the year, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he had never voted in the world soccer election, accusations came to FIFA from other countries. Egypt was not considered at all - with a curious justification.
Much at FIFA has proven to be offensive in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Football Election has so far not been suspicious of running unclean - if one rejects the national voter's object of uncleanness - if one rejects the national voter's object of
But after Nicaragua’s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, other inconsistencies now emerge: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly viewable voting overview.
Fifa apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms were given in capital letters and therefore were not valid" and the Egyptian association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan's coach also surprised
While the situation in the case of Egypt is comprehensible, the Sudanese federation states that trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally assessed: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to FIFA, the vote went like this.
“I did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you,” he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football federation simply voted on his behalf.
The federation sent the message on Friday that it was true, but of course it was not intended. The completed electoral documents were "erroneously" in the list with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it said in a communication of the federation.
The other cases are now examined by FIFA in an investigation, but stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. For so long, Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world soccer election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine Affair: High-ranking Republicans Call for Official Investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have spoken out openly for an official inquiry into US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the inquiry is important," said Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, will be determined by the facts that will be determined." He wants to know more about the whistleblower's affair.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and former Vice President Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have withheld criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair so far, few have revealed discomfort. Scott’s remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party, while the moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as easing environmental protection regulations and tightening immigration.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governor of the U.S. state, have formally failed to comment on the lawsuit against Trump, which will be decided in Congress. Their remarks are therefore above all symbolic. Nevertheless, first senators of the Republicans have also voiced criticism about the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said that the case is "extremely disturbing the U.
The affair could lead to the initiation of an impeachment proceedings against Trump, which the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could seek a so-called impeachment. But the decision on an actual impeachment fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a process are therefore low. So far no U.S. president has been enached by an impeachment.
Were there torturers on board of Rackete's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily and reportedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had taken the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board to the port of Lampedusa. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was again arrested after a few days by an Italian woman.
Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects were arrested in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We can't exclude this from the German press," the new-pres.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country were raped, tormented and even murdered. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and repeatedly exposed to physical violence" at the time.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports," Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships.
Italy’s right-wing interior minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk seeks record delivery at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
“We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the Electrek industry blog.
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could record 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter said. The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly. To do so, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went trading with an increase of more than 6%. The price has not so strongly increased for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars, reaching its previous peak.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures are required in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
U.S. budget dispute: Once again just bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the United States on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to raise the spending ceilings for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans ahead of the new fiscal year beginning on October 1. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has reached a transitional funding decision (Continuing Resolution, CR) on Monday, it would have decided to a federal one by November 21.
Shutdown avoided
The Federal Administration is now provisionally financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. The Federal Administration can therefore not benefit for the time being from the expenditure framework extended from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio. $ for the new fiscal year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve bills in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect priorities of the Democrats who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate has also prepared ten of the twelve spending plans, which are barely capable of majority.
The ghosts diverge mainly on the issue of resource allocation for the area of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, Republicans seem to try to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump's major priorities. The Democrats are disturbing the plans for the construction of the wall and its financing, which had actually led to other military constructions and projects in December 2018. The dispute over the wall was already
At the building of the wall, the ghosts separate
It is currently unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws over the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional funding beyond November 21 is not excluded.
Against the backdrop of the Congress’ continued inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated danger of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Proposal S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the funding of the federal administration at the previous year’s level, stop the travel plans of parliamentarians annually and curtail their wages.
France Allows Artificial Insemination for Lesbians and Singles
In France, artificial insemination is expected to be open to women and lesbians living alone: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro insemination, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations significantly.
The submission still requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the cost of artificial insemination for all women should be borne by social insurance.
Insemination with sperm from dead husband is banned
By contrast, with a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which was intended to give widows access to their dead husband's sperm for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial insemination "post-mortem" is allowed. In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women have in vain been an opponent of the resurrection of the sperm of a deceased child.
Many members of the governing party La République en Marche (The Republic in Motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition opposed the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow will be imposed a "double grief" if her wish for children remains unfulfilled by the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now unsuccessful amendment consider it unfair for a widow to be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot have children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced this summer that surrogacy will continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - however, it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate Compensation: Calls for tax on Unis are getting louder
A lot is being flown at the universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future. The rectors say they do not have money for it. But now they are also under internal pressure.
Colleges should also be restricted when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate about a climate tax on flights from universities and universities, which was postponed before the summer break, is still coming to life again. After the rectors' conference had initially sceptically reacted to a corresponding move from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six baden-württemberg universities call for a debate as necessary.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB, the detainees were said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At the time, there was a change of fire between the border guards and the crew of the boat. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured. The fisherman later claimed to have died his serious injuries. This time there were no injuries.
The communist North Korea suffers from a chronic food shortage. North Korean fishermen were on the road in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard, according to its own data, patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 inkfish confiscated
In the re-checks, 30,000 inkfish were discovered and confiscated on the boats, and three fishing and two motor boats were reportedly confiscated and transported to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
The Russian Fisheries Authority did not issue fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs, and thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been temporarily arrested there this year, according to media reports.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished with tightly meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also take small living creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would be destroyed for 200 b years.
Only 18,000 remain in the future: U.S. lowers asylum ceiling
The “most generous nation in history”: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officials in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shying away from asylum seekers: As confirmed by the Department of Foreign Affairs in Washington, the ceiling for the legal entry of refugees will be further lowered.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be allowed into the country, as the U.S. Department of State declared. In the now almost expired marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump’s administration has drastically lowered the readiness to welcome people from all over the world in recent years, with far higher intake limits governed by Barack Obama’s predecessor.
The proposed cap of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was introduced in 1980, but the U.S. Foreign Ministry called the United States the “most compassionate and generous nation in history,” a phrase that strongly recalls the use of the current U.S. president’s language.
A “responsible approach” to refugees aims to allow the refugees to return to their home countries to help with reconstruction, Trump said. For his hard course in migration policy he receives much support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
One major issue is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to shut down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. Whether there is a time-related relationship between the current measure and current domestic policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under threat due to the Selenskyj affair and a potentially impending office
According to the Foreign Office, the U.S. government wants to focus in the future on the reception of two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and thus endangered, according to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while a maximum of 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to be accepted.
The U.S. wants people from this "northern triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries, with the United States signing migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the U.S. southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
At the request of the Argentinean judiciary, an orangutan girl has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a collecting station for monkeys in the United States. The "Sandra", born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release was mandatory. The animal was declared by direct flight to Dallas on Thursday evening, but was transported to Andréz's Cathedral - but not as a passenger.
As the 53-kilogram human aphid is unable to adapt to life in the wild, she is expected to live in the open space of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly a pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, a "Sandra-Widget" still has to be around in the Florida.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years at the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 trial of "Sandras" by animal rights activists has contributed to the transformation of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an eco-park. By 2023, there will be a research and educational site for the conservation of species.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride on the nearly 3,000-metre-high Grand Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without grid, double ground or other aids, the Swiss defeated the 550-metre-high north wall of the Grand Zinne in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom from dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent, thus undercutting the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of Europe’s six most important northern walls.
Nike Benefits From New Online Marketing Strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, U.S. sports goods manufacturer Nike has posted a significant profit increase. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (nearly €1.3 billion). That is 25 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, as the group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which Adidas is directly targeting customers.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August, with Nike’s sales up 22 percent in China, benefitting from its approach to targeting consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps, as well as in the People’s Republic of Oregon.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to drive the sportswear manufacturer's "digital transformation" with strategic investments, thereby expanding its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the sportswear manufacturer's shares rose by more than five percent.
Lifelong ban on stadiums due to racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital imposed a lifetime ban on a fan in 2016. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private messages and urged his club to take action. "<0x40>officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan"
The club responded late on Thursday. He reported the fan's account on Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporters are never allowed to visit a match of the club, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly Italian fans racist insults against black players rivaling teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the weekend.
The Italian authorities have now banned 38 fans of record-breaking Juventus Turin, four of whom are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. The rest are banned from four to seven years.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations of twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had rolled the investigation with an indictment last year.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders are behind the black trade in tickets, they have "militarily controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are devoted to grabbing names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective way of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This call officially kicked off the crab catch at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun on September 21, which also ushered in the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee's Public Relations Department.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent natural surroundings".
The people of Gaochun started crab breeding as early as the 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that provided high incomes and became an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively sought to promote a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distributing power, optimizing administration and government services" and has carefully built the service network for "approvals under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending" to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun harnesses the local advantages by linking the area to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui, which has been fully promoted to the development of the national tourism area and its position as an international "slow city" as flagships for the development of this area.
Iran-U.S. Conflict: Ruhani Talks about End of Sanctions - Trump Opposes
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, after his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged U.S. offer to lift sanctions in exchange for talks with Tehran’s leadership to put an end to all sanctions, Rouhani said on his official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump, however, opposed the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: “Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so that there is a meeting. I said, of course, no.”
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and urged a meeting to take place. “And America says I’m lifting the sanctions,” Rouhani added.
However, the move was not made in an acceptable manner, Ruhani criticized, and given the current penal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure" no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is supposed to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron had expressed hope, like Merkel, on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After being shaken by two earthquakes in a very short time, fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before, there have been nearly 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday, raising fear of a catastrophe.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. The 5.8 earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region outside Istanbul and sparked panic in the million metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The latent danger is repeatedly ignored in the city itself. Every year, poorly constructed residential homes fall - among other things, crushing by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces registered as refuges in the center have long been built. It was not until the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August that the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul are not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of Thursday's quake was in the Marmara Sea in front of the Silivri district and at a depth of about seven kilometers, as reported by the Afad Civil Protection Agency. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, said on Twitter that no injuries or damage had been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students were crying, as can be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Below the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian Earth Plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. The earthquake on Thursday hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies are designing emergency plans, private individuals have packed so-called go-bags with everything they need standing next to front doors, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big quake is coming is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom) according to which two minarets of mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning for aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings shaken. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He urged people to stay away from buildings, the visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the earthquake is 13:59 (local time), and just minutes after the first earthquake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a post-earthquake, which was reported with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt as far as Istanbul. Also its epicenter had been located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the civil protection agency Afad said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Scientists believe that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükru Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It would have become more likely, he told CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy told the station. "Sooner or later, the great earthquake will also come."
There had been an incident just a few weeks ago - the earthquake also caused great worries in Istanbul. In addition, there had been a violent earthquake only a few days ago in Albania - there were 68 injuries. Also this year the Lake Constance had puffed the earth.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine affair
Two breaking documents provide a new ignition in the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment process, US Democrats see themselves strengthened: the complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president.
United Airlines passenger imprisoned in toilet - redirected
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight was rerouted by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said, according to US media.
During an extra-scheduled stopover in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time), the woman was finally released from the narrow cabin. She had been locked in it for about an hour, U.S. media wrote, citing other passengers. For the next flight to San Francisco, passengers had to change the aircraft.
In a video posted on the Internet, which is said to have originated from Flight 1554, we see several people trying to free the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, Ma'am. We will get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. First, it was openly, whether the woman will receive compensation.
The cockroach: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous narrative “The Transformation,” British success author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Cockroach" (Original: "The Cockroach") will not be published in German on November 27, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now at once is the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as the will of the people, to be in
McEwan was quoted as saying, "If the parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers shamelessly lie like the Soviet leaders once, if Brexiteers in high positions are pleading for the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There was only one answer to it:
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed to an immense insect", is gradually excluded from family and society, and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that stands head," Diogenes Verlag said.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austria’s railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce the noise pollution caused by freight trains, and sections of the rail connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are being modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this is to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips until October 31, 2019, one day after his insolvency application. "Travel could not be undertaken for reasons of insolvency law," the company said on Thursday evening.
This also affected bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be reviewed, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer money back to hotels
As of Friday, however, hotels abroad, which are still hosting Thomas Cook holidaymakers, are expected to receive money from Zurich insurance. Payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked for extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without the presentation of separate invoices, hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson told the German Press Agency. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels will not be asked for individual payment of hotel invoices or otherwise required by angels," said the spokesperson.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their accommodations on site themselves. Some had to put more than 1,000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centrals had sharply criticized this.
As many hotels are affected, the insolvent travel provider will be coordinated on Friday, the insurance spokesperson said. According to Thursday data, there were still 70,000 Thomas-Cook vacationers from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured holidays and return travel of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich Insurance will only help travellers who are currently on the road. For Thomas Cook customers who are still planning to fly on holiday, it looks bad. In the late Thursday evening, the company informed that all trips until and including 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
As for trips starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said. In principle, Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about possibilities of refund of the travel price and make their claims through a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
Prince Harry has long been pursuing Lady Diana's engagement, and in Africa he is now walking in the footsteps of his mother.
Dressed in a blue splinter protective vest, Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust in the town of Dirico, on Friday morning, he set the ignition circuit in front of running TV cameras. In a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savannah landscape, without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict, there are still more than 1000 miners in the African country.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take the path that she walked then. The pictures that Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also been supporting the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African journey since Monday, beginning in the South African tourist city of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations: the danger of a no-deal remains acute
Actually, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had determined clearly: with him there will be a third postponement of Brexit negotiations guaranteed. But what statements are already of eternal duration in the polarizing British. The most recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the UK has floated like a damocles sword over the blonde head. His suspension of parliament was cancelled again in order to carry out his Brexit course from October until the exit date.
Boris Johnson says deal is still possible
However, the pressure does not seem to go past Johnson, who, while visiting a hospital, hinted that he would support an extension of negotiations by the end of October in the event of a non-agreement:
You know, we'll stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running away from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels gradually. About six weeks later, the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But even the recent talks have not made a breakthrough again. An agreement by the end of October seems at present rather difficult to conceive. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a new postponement of the exit is in place.
US authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the U.S. health agency CDC reported. Increasing according to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine". There have already been more than 900 affected, about 500 of them are still confirmed the cause of the lung damage in Europe.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared in online networks. The construction contractor and actor living in Spain calls for a "people's revolution". For this Friday he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes mass demonstrations with a million participants in central places of the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. There was already an increased police presence in the center of Cairo. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. In recent days, police had already intensified their road controls and searched pedestrian phones for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. Such an open protest had not taken place in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW) nearly 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been wrongly arrested at the place "because they were arbitrarily arrested" - only because they were incorrectly arrested at the place.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. According to the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he overthrew the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been partially convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox from Greenland Expedition back
Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday and was greeted on his arrival in Hamburg port by skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg over the Atlantic with the race yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had been investigating and documenting the effects of global warming on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar scientist. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak up. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming. Still, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens at sea often happens at the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, Greenland glacier ice was measured with a drone and fished with nets for microplastics, it said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
Two Japanese tourists seemed to be too much for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the castle in Rome. The bill with a tip of 80 euros was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases are detrimental to the reputation of Rome, and we call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, told the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The owners of the restaurant responded promptly. The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified. However, this cannot be seen from the invoice. A tip of up to 20 percent of the invoice is also normal, the innkeeper said.
After the turbulent revelations of the past few days, US President Donald Trump could actually face an impeachment process, the Democrats now want to examine it as soon as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - the talk is weeks before a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly actively the phone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to use against the political instrument in 2020. The accusation of the whistleblower, who has brought the conversation out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the US with his complaint, is monstrous: the president has misused the power of his office in order to misuse the influence of the government of another country.
The core of this project can also be seen in the now-published memo of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full wording. The July 25 phone call is only an episode of a much larger story, at the center of which, besides Trump, is mainly his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the point of view of the public in May 2019, when the New York Times reported on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine very unlawfully. He wants to meet in Kiev with the just-elected president Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are sensitive. "We don't get involved in an election, we get involved in an investigation of what we are right to do".
The lawyer and former mayor of New York seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixed on Trump’s opponent candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia’s investigations in the US, but this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is exactly the investigations that Trump will talk so prominently about in July on the phone with Selenskyj. The version of Giuliani and the president is: the former vice president and currently promising candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has been his senior investigator to stop him in Ukraine. As a Ukraine representative of the Obama administration, he has been responsible for the dismissal of the then Ukrainian general prosecurator.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian prosecutor-general leave, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. In addition, Schokin himself was deeply accused of corrupt conduct, the US government was by far not the only Western partner that explicitly supported the investigation against the Obama administration.

Instagram Disruption Facebook and Whatsapp: Social Media is Down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, mainly Germany, the UK and Spain are affected. On the website allestörungen.de users report that Facebook has not loaded again and again since about 3.30 pm. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Even Whatsapp seems affected by the disturbance, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. More Often Affected by Disturbances
This isn’t the first massive crash this year. In March and July, the services were down for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also this time mainly resort to Twitter to air their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were traveling by inflatable boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in misfortune - less than an hour it took the Chilean rescue helicopter to recover.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
“At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, just before 10 a.m. we launched, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the inflatable boat.”
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER charge wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Although inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, it should still not be used.
Since several new smartphones have come on the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall again a study from the beginning of July. While wireless charging mobile devices is extremely convenient, it is not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally via cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees in three hours. When charging wirelessly, the power rises even slightly higher with the perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad, the battery always rises in excess of 30 degrees.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery does not only change in capacity, but it does not last as long as it does. So the lifetime is shorter. The researchers therefore advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery replacement with modern smartphones is always associated with a high cost, this should be a helpful tip.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and tedious plug fummelei. Since Qi (stands for inductive power transmission) is only a worldwide standard, in which, exceptionally, even Apple should participate in the technology, there are hardly any restrictions.
Everest Dump Photographer: 13 Eight Thousands in Six Months
A Nepali mountaineer has climbed 13 of the world’s 14 highest mountains in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: from him comes a photo of mountaineers who are standing in the queue on Mount Everest, which went viral in the spring.
The image of the mass crowd sparked a debate about stronger security measures on the 8,848-metre-high mountain and highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers died at the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th Eight Thousand: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is mentioned among other bad weather. Earlier this week Purja wrote on Twitter that the Nepalese government wanted to talk to China to allow it to climb.
Four dead elephants found in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephant was poisoned."
The four corpses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. The animals were presumably between 15 and 25 years old according to the police spokesman. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously held harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This is usually the case when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that there are only about 7,000 elephants left in Sri Lanka, and that their killing is theoretically punishable by the death penalty.
Detained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after being seized by Iran, according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker under British flag on July 19, accusing it of breaking maritime law regulations in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in Criticism
The Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to thoroughly investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook, which is to deal with the salary packages of the board as well as the question of why the British government did not like to financially support the company struggling to survive. "Our interest is the supervision in the company as well as the control by external auditors," the committee chairman told London.
According to experts, genes are overestimated at risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the family’s increased risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are therefore likely to be heavier than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of individual colon cancer risk, the DKF stresses.
Elon Musk raises Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday by the industry blog "Electrek" that demand was strong, so Tesla could record 110,000 orders, Musk wrote in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, with Tesla having to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went trading with an increase of more than 6%. The price has not so strongly increased for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered more than 95,000 cars, reaching its previous highest value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures are required in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were losses last.
British government wants to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson restrained
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering up whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the law last passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit, when he told reporters on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no deal is reached with the EU by mid-October, Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use “political harassment” to circumvent the law and put in place a procedural trick that would postpone the law’s entry into force until after EU exit.
Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union: “We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is with an agreement.”
Iran Apparently Rises Uranium Enrichment
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on European contractors in the fight to save the historic nuclear deal. “Unfortunately, the European states are showing inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions,” Rouhani said Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. In case they do not stand up to their pledges, he pledged “further steps” away from the agreement in 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian atomic bomb, which limited in return the pledge to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US pulled out of the agreement in 2018 alone to force Iran to change course in the Middle East policy deemed aggressively. The government of Donald Trump wants to re-enter a new agreement with Tehran in the recent agreement.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using uranium or at least prepared for use of the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September, and that Iran is preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges, according to the IAEA.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to bear their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rouhani alleged, but there will still be further talks that hopefully will bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in Saudi attacks
However, the situation has changed following an attack on a major oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom on Monday followed the U.S. assessment that Tehran bears responsibility for the attack. Originally, Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had acknowledged the attack, which the U.S. did not consider as a false confession on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence," Rouhani said. However, the European leaders had not been able to do so in the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they had only invoked that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met in recent days with British Chancellor Borron and French President Angela Merkel.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions by the US administration would have to be lifted, Rouhani demanded, urging the Washington government to shift to a policy of “dialogue and reason.”
Comet from another star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space, which has previously been possible. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn from other solar systems.
What was initially just an assumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest is crossing our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was baptized after its discoverer to 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The far-climbing comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea with a 65-centimeter-diameter self-built telescope. Follow-up observations by various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not originate from our solar system.
According to 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object seen during a voyage through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get close-up insights into a foreign solar system before disappearing to Nasa. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. "The current velocity of the comet is high, about 150,000 km per hour at the distance of the Sun, about 150,000 km per hour."
According to analyses, the comet is travelling on a so-called hyperbel orbit that takes it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was first listed in the catalogue C, was the first object of the planet.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted on the approach, so the researchers remain many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be visible by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," Farnocchia explained. "Then it will be observed only by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes.
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor, for example, a team led by Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in a first study the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum similar to that of our other interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar to that of the other solar system," said IAC researcher Julia Lecon.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open up a new path for exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German for example comet interceptor) on a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, it is supposed to lurk either on a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People’s Republic, the time has come: a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China’s most recent prestige project is known as “Seestern” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which are to be expanded to seven later, and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Even during construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has been repeatedly postponed so far. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine landed after four years.
New supersonic aircraft is expected to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams. It is intended to make possible this, for the 2030s targeted flight at supersonic speed already a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire developed.
To advance the project, the British Space Agency intends to work together with the Australian Aircraft Development Agency. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolitan area, the U.S.A.A.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on its homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that is five times faster than sound. In addition, such aircraft are also deployable outside the Earth's atmosphere, thus enabling the "next generation of reusable aircraft".
Uprising in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump said Thursday in front of U.S. envoys to the United Nations in New York, saying the person concerned was almost "a spy" and had been treated "a little differently" in the past than today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tippers. The event was not actually public. However, several U.S. media broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted outraged to the president's statement.
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday announced preparations for an impeachment case against Trump, based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official raising serious allegations against Trump and his government headquarters.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government officials that the U.S. president “uses the power of his office” to get another country to intervene in his favor in the U.S. election in 2020.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate what could harm his political rival Joe Biden.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of covering up the Ukraine phone call: Leading government officials had made an effort to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been prepared. This was removed after the conversation on instructions from lawyers from the White House, but a specially planned database was published instead of a normal system for it.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was said to be an employee of the foreign intelligence service CIA.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had disseminated second-hand information that would have turned out to be inaccurate.
In New York, Trump’s remarks about the whistleblower’s alleged information sparked indignation, with House chairman Nancy Pelosi reacting disquieted and complaining that Trump’s statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his environment have been underway in various committees for months now. Faced with Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing forward investigations with new force to start a possible impeachment process against Trump.
"The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the intelligence committee at the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump sharply attacked ship, accused him of misrepresenting things, and again called for the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly blasphemed ship and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy spheres, who were mostly under Democratic but also Republican presidents, put themselves in a statement released on Friday behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible impeachment process.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. But the decision on an actual impeachment fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far no impeachment has been made by the US President.
VW Business Council: Jobs are being ‘sneakyly’ cut
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the carmaker’s works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by EUR 10 billion by EUR 2 billion by 2023. Of this, EUR 500 million is to be saved as early as this year.
A key to this are the personnel costs. The "Future Pact", which was negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016, already envisages the reduction of 14,000 jobs by 2020 in Germany alone. In principle, a job can only be dismantled at the car manufacturer if it is practically proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security until 2029 applies.
As our newspaper has now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which are not actually available, are "sneaking" down another way - i.e. past the official course. Thus, freely becoming regular positions would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing the re-occupation. In the meantime, there is a lack of staff in many places, which increases the compression of work, the concerns about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would be greater. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could be gradually deducted from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable to adapt to it in other parts of the world.
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and to control new projects centrally. This also aims to reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - behind it is the goal to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war we are good.
There are already successes in this way: for example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. In front of journalists Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be shortened by 1.1 hours. Exact figures for the production time does not mention VW, according to information from our newspaper it is around the Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW plant in which vehicles are produced. The plants in Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW internally applies the rule of thumb that 800,000 cars must be built annually in order for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, the utilization in Wolfsburg was on the same level as the consumption of only 700,000 vehicles.
As production director Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars are expected to roll from the belt in Wolfsburg "perspective". This is meant to make it possible to bundle the Golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant through the conversion to the site for e-car production delivers the Golf production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg, but the sales of Golf and Tiguan have declined in the last few years. Therefore, expectations now rest on the Golf 8.
Voodoo forced into prostitution: convicted of human traffickers
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, thrown into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six alleged human traffickers have been jailed for this.
Six alleged human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had dragged young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women willing to leave had to drop a sister in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought over the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in inflatable boats. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to work out the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25,000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the infiltration and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the process. "The work made it difficult for the women to deal physically and mentally," judge Isabel Hoffmann said at the verdict. "Some were rightly disgusted."
The judgments are based on the commercial and gang-based infiltration of foreigners, human trafficking, looting and severe forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant union Ufo has once again threatened to strike.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "on October 14 inform about the labour-fighting measures in the LH Group", Ufo tariff officer Daniel Flohr said on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with Ufo for months. This is also the question of whether the union has legally cancelled collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the requests. The company confirmed the decision and is considering appealing against it. "I consider it unlikely that a second court will see the matter completely differently," said Ufo Board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Frankfurter Landesarbeitsgericht to have the UFO’s status as a trade union verified by court, arguing that the trade union had not employed a representative board for months and was therefore unable to fulfil its role as a trade union partner.
A fierce leadership dispute had preceded in the Sparte union, during which many members of the Board of Management and the Advisory Board resigned, including the long-standing union chief Nicoley Baublies. The UFO had suspended a preliminary vote already begun on strikes of cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about their leadership.
Easier Entry: Saudi Arabia Announces New Visa System
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but that is to change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists by 2030 to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
“The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said Tourism Commission Chairman Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is difficult for tourists so far. Visas are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimage trips or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes to increase revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. In the aftermath, national oil production collapsed drastically, the oil price shots reached old levels. It is likely that it will take several weeks for the Kingdom’s oil production to regain
Justin and Hailey Bieber in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos on their Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) showing her in a white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles, according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits, including banana-printed suits, on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple plans to marry church next weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers gave the yes to each other in a New York State Registry Office, and there was no bigger party at the time.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small plane in western Czechia. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been searching for the aircraft since Thursday evening after the crew had issued an emergency signal by GPS. In the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of the accident has yet to be investigated. The crash site lies about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are at risk of extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable timber strikes and the growth of cities cause the threat, the World Union for the Protection of Nature (IUCN) reported in Brussels on Friday. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "strongly endangered", "threatening to extinction" and "extinction in nature" to "extinction".
Eberesche and wild horse chestnut threatened
One of the authors, David Allen, told the German Press Agency: "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild Ordinary Horse Chestnuts. They are considered to be "threatening" since 2017, stage two of this IUCN scale. The greatest threat pose besides a fungus the Balkan Mining Motte. It has spread since the 1980s from Southeastern Europe throughout the continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horses in the park are less than 10,000.
Shrub species and moose also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than one-fifth of the molluscs and mosses and nearly half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, to entrained species, agricultural practices and climate change.
“This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,” said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office.
Earthquake outside Istanbul: 34 injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured, dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been nearly 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 on Thursday had shaken the Marmara region outside Istanbul and triggered panic in the million metropolis.
Turkey has not been prepared enough for earthquakes over the past 20 years, Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said, adding that the government is planning to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future.
Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth Plate.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday, an earthquake of 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul, with authorities calling on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the half-time show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced on Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is excited to be on the Super Bowl stage in February 2020.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at the time she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina" she can't wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world".
Shakira said in a statement that she felt honored to stand alongside another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world, representing Latinos and Latinos from the US and around the world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time the two "queens" have been on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining spectator numbers
The Super Bowl is the culmination of the American football season. The game and the halftime show are among the most watched TV shows in the USA. Even if you have seen the most recent drop in viewership, this February attracted the fewest viewers in the US in more than ten years, yet it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
In the run-up to the half-time show of the last Super Bowl, there had been riots in the run-up: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to media reports last February, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was not on his knees in the 2016/17 season before the NFL games in the 2017 national anthem for reasons of protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took the gesture. This caused great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump himself attacked the most afro-American
Cook plea: hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to face the bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report. There is a threat of high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse would have to make total amortizations of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion on their books, the report said, according to estimates from consulting firm AlixPartners.
Creditors of bonds would have to buy depreciation of <0xC2><0xA3>900 million to 1 billion and lenders between <0xC2><0xA3>550 million and <0xC2><0xA3>825 million. The amounts actually to be depreciated are more likely to be at the top of the range, an expert said.
How big the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will be shown after the end of the insolvency proceedings. A person close to this process did not express too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 Thomas Cook aircraft in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in poor positions. Most of the money can probably be obtained by selling the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand.
Rackete allegedly brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who have allegedly tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we ourselves do not have secure information about it," Sea-Watch refugee organization spokesman Ruben Neugebauer told the dpa news agency.
Other migrants have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. New builders stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports".
On June 29, Carola Rackete brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa while boarding a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects are said to have arrived there. The captain is being investigated for aid to illegal immigration.
U.S. government warns against Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust Chinese network equipment manufacturer Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great," Pai told the "Handelsblatt" in view of the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from security agencies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties of such requests, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a “confidence statement” from suppliers.
Berlin first wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology is not only hardware:
It is the software that is important to keep the devices up-to-date, with billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It is “very hard to imagine” that a government agency, “no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to track down security risks,” the FCC chief said.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The company, which is allegedly owned by the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the United States, and the U.S. government officials have been posted inside the company.
Chemistry factory in northern France burns: schools closed
During the night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky over a North French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and nurseries in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday as a precaution, the competent prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had called on citizens to stay in buildings as much as possible and not to be exposed to smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals indoors, protect their feed and stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that after the extinguishing smell will spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 police and gendarmes were deployed at the fire site.
A gigantic black column of smoke had previously emerged from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which produces the additive for oils. The production facility is a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites that are under special surveillance. In 1976 a devastating chemical accident occurred in the Italian Seveso near Milan.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that there was initially no "high toxicity" in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. In the river, dams were built against the pollution, the prefecture explained.
Rouen is a regional metropolis located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre, where the fire broke out early in the morning at 2:40 a.m., the authorities reported.
French Finance Minister: "Germany needs to invest now"
French Economic and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investments to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions.”
Those states that have budgetary margins for more investment should act, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, referring to the high national debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French national debt must be "stabilized" and "lowered", said Le Maire.
In recent years, German politicians have repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments to boost the European economy, while German politicians have repeatedly urged France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is responding to the protests of the Yellow Vests movement, with new debt expected to fall to 2.2 percent, up from an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson shuns questions about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticizes the "capitulation law" passed by parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering up whether he wants to impose an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently passed by parliament, which is exactly what is to prevent it. On a corresponding question, Johnson told journalists only that his government would abide by the applicable law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October, Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law to the time after EU exit. Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU the best way on October 31st."
Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said he feels the political disputes over Brexit as a “walk in the park” and was confident that the intended EU exit will still be achieved: “We enjoy this, we will win, we will leave (notice: from the EU) to a book,” Cumms said.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" in the run-up to the 2016 EU referendum, now serves as chief strategist at Downing Street, Britain's seat of government, behind the uncompromising policy that has put the prime minister in an almost impossible situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Bags) delves deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the film "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, including Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram, “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look into the lives of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film.”
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, a few hundred of which are now published for the first time in The Polaroid Diaries.
There are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, one is always at the center: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.
Then he was dancing with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephoned in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wearing unshaped moonboots. Of course, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they would have led a very normal life on their farm in southern England or in Scotland. So Mary McCartney said that as an old baby she had been sleeping in.
Like hardly any other medium, the polo-raid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's about the deciding click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing exactly the right moment. "She just knew she did," Paul said in the Eshun.
The light, the composition, the cut-out and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but besides all the anecdotal is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes look exactly like abstract paintings.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran."
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop importing oil and gas from Iran, despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,” Erdogan said in New York, where he had attended the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems with importing Iranian oil, as some companies "have withdrawn because of US threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey will “especially continue our relations with Iran on this and many other issues,” said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and in recent months tensions in the Gulf region have escalated considerably.
U.S. government wants to restrict the admission of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that the annual ceiling for a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said that while the U.S. continues to be committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overburdened.
The U.S. government wants to focus on receiving two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who helped the U.S. military in the country and were in danger, according to the Foreign Ministry statement, with a maximum of 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The program, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the program. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House at nearly 8,000, the White House, the lowest in the history of the program.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, which would further damage the United States’ leadership role in protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the U.S. - legal as well as illegal -. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump: “Come Close to a Spike”
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage in the whistleblower affair. Whoever has given the whistleblower who accuses him of misuse of power appropriate hints "comes close to a spy," Trump said, according to a record of a private event in New York on Thursday.
Accordingly, Trump spoke to U.N. mission officials. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "That's close to a spie." Then Trump added, "You know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal we used to do a little bit differently now."
Observers assessed the latter’s remark on a possible reference to the death penalty. Democrats sharply criticized Trump’s remarks and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to hinder a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment process against him.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now-published complaint of abusing his office to ask for interference from another country in the U.S. election 2020. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump urged him to investigate any possible Hcratic herd.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his whistleblowers are, but according to the New York Times, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst of the foreign intelligence service CIA.
Refugee boat cranked: baby and toddlers drowned in the Aegean
Time and again, people are trying to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece, where the boats are often too small. Seven migrants have now died in the sinking of an inflatable boat, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the sinking of an inflatable boat, including a baby and four other children, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is said to be a smuggler, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr reported. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the mainland of Turkey.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean Sea, mostly in far too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Cancel Concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has come to a close due to the inadequacy of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. At the eighth song Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should leave it while it's still running."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized, adding that Daltrey "can't really speak now" and promised the audience to come to a reparations concert.
The Who, scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, said they would be retrieved at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Suddenly discontinued rental: WeWork shakes real estate markets
In New York, WeWork has grown to become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear billions of revenues.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world suddenly. The company had dismissed founder Adam Neumann as boss, postponed the planned IPO, and began selling subsidiaries and securities such as the private jet to the executives, in order to immediately gain financial margin for the coming weeks and months.
WeWork rents large office spaces for the long term and rents them for the short term in part small units to members. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has been burning money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company was losing $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion, the new area is expected to be lost.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion, which could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in London, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, nearly 300,000 square feet of office space over the past 24 months. WeWork’s new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York would have been greater than the newly launched space.
Even in the British capital, the balance in the real estate market could be noticeably shifted without a further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a last year by savings bank fund provider Deka bought office house for nearly 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off a portion of the expected billions of revenues. Access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork they do not have despite the long-term leases. Because the lease of the subsidiaries is usually the only ones of the special companies.
Russia has arrested many North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 other poachers who illegally fished in the waters have been arrested, the Russian domestic intelligence agency FSB told Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it said. The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
Accordingly, North Korean fishermen were trapped in Russian territorial waters. There, according to their own data, the Russian Coast Guard drives patrols to protect their marine biological resources. In the re-checks, 30,000 squids were discovered. In addition, according to reports, three fishermen and two motor boats were seized and the agency was brought to the coast of Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok in 2018.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been temporarily arrested there in 2019, according to media reports.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with tightly meshed synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. With these would also take small living creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply dispose of the ships in the sea, where they would be drained for 200 years.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the arrests last week. One also wounded North Korean died later from his injuries, according to the FSB. On September 17, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
U.S. bans ex-President Castro
The U.S. has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. State Department said in a statement Thursday that Castro was involved in "gross human rights violations". As head of the Caribbean state's Communist Party, he faces a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily detained and more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also guilty of human rights violations there through the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and in Venezuela," the tweet said.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued entry bans against members of the Venezuelan government and the military, among others. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has raged for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him to kneel and to impose the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduro. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of deployed doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are likely to start due to the shift in time before the protests move across Europe to North America. There climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Also in front of the White House in Washington, Dea wanted to attend.
How big the global response will be this Friday after the record-breaking participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday over four million people have been striking for the climate. This Friday we are doing it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
Especially in Germany last Friday the influx was very large. A good third of all the worldwide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated according to estimates of Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller cities.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had sat before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of his country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This led to the emergence of the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be curbed to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial time.
Thunberg arrived in New York just over a month ago after a two-week transatlantic defense tour with a deep-sea racing yacht. She had most recently participated in climate protests and United Nations summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she was urged to speak to the world’s heads of state and government about her climate right.
Russia bans smoking on balcony
People in Russia are not allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency said Thursday in Moscow to the agency Tass. The ban is to come into force on October 1.
Anyone who smokes, therefore, has to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, then the penalty is higher. Under the prohibition, according to the ministry, also burning candles fall. Also grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Cybercriminals hit - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time picked up a large server provider for illegal transactions on the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of hosting numerous websites through which international criminals carried out their machinations as the operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle.
The Prosecutor General’s Office in Koblenz said that seven suspects were arrested Thursday evening in a large action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world’s second largest darknet marketplace for drugs, “Wall Street Market”, which investigators had smashed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled by a server in the cyberbunker, according to the Attorney General.
A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence, it said, for the first time in Germany.
The access action, with the support of special units such as the GSG9, had been searched in Germany and in neighboring countries. It was the result of nearly five years of investigations. At noon the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolitan areas such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg’s backmen?
Justice and courage are great virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl is holding the mirror in front of the power people of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or wise marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or even manipulative tactics?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and gets young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win an accumulation of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nicholas from Cologne has felt chosen to win over the sea for a more just world.
But is there a shadow side in this regard? Why does it take a lot of stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has sold widely, thanks to the action of the daughter in the spotlight. Also the last proven followers of Greta Thunberg were a bit of money in the world.
Here the spirits are now divorcing: Is it morally right to enrich oneself in saving the world financially? Is it still authentic that certain circles of people work together with stockbrokers during the World Rescue Action? Regardless of what position is ultimately taken in it, a critical and reflected viewpoint is increasingly important to make it possible to live in a democratically shaped society.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Our Solar System
A strange comet is currently intersecting our solar system.
The assumptions of the astronomers have been confirmed: a foreign comet is currently intersecting our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington – Researchers have long guessed it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently intersecting our solar system, named after its explorer 2I/Borisov, and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked up to the sky with a self-made telescope and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate in our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be seen during the flight.
The great chance for astronomers is now to get close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the Comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbel orbit that takes it out of our system.
Comet has been spotted before approach – and can be observed for several months
Unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in its approach in 2020, which means that it can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the tail star's spectrum is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets could form in other solar systems by similar processes as in our Jaic, de León's supplements.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Recently, a giant asteroid rushed past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
'Absolutely reprehensible': Rachel Johnson appalled by her brother
Boris Johnson is getting lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges with clear words the Prime Minister's warrior language as "flavourless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Scam", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continuing to equip - at least verbally. At the questionnaire in the lower house on Wednesday this ran into massive outrage of the opposition, and by now other critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words like surrender, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, lengthened, quartered, fermented and feathered". She considers this to be overly reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version again, said Rachel Johnsons, who was the UK's anti-ex-parliament in the elections.
She was particularly stunned by the fact that her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly lower house deputy who had come out of the camp, had obviously "traveled all the way out" by a neo-Nazi who had been murdered a few days before the 2016 referendum. The memory of which could best be honored by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the lower house.
Cox's widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick if Jos's name is used this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to be passionate and determined for what one believes in - no matter what one's opinion. But you should never become "demonize the other side." He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson’s younger brother Jo had resigned as Secretary of State and as Tory MP. “I have been torn between loyalty to the family and the national interest in recent months – it’s an indissoluble tension,” said Johnson.
Johnson’s language has also come under sharp criticism in the Church. According to the “Times”, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is “not worthy of this country”. In a joint statement, they stated: “In recent days, language has been unacceptable, both in debates and outside of parliament.” We should have been with each other.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong signal in the year of its 100th anniversary: in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear, who promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming U.S. NFL football league final, the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
“I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo because it has an incredible strength in the US,” Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2nd. In the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she ended up with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in German cinemas from November onwards in the drama "Hustlers".
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer, making her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the US every time. This year, many consider the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump’s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused fury there. Usually watch well over 100 million TV viewers at the NFL Finals. It is also extremely popular in Germany by now.
Last year there was political controversy in advance. The reason was the controversy over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to protest against police violence against blacks, many of whom had refused to rise when playing the national anthem and had been harshly tackled by US President Donald Trump. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had dropped out on a super-Bow.
An actor and youtuber assaults Egypt’s ruler: For the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have influenced whether or not to let blood flow back on the streets of Egypt, Trump's protesters had "don't lost the concern in the past week, the president's two people in a foreign country".The president of the United Nations, Abdelfattah al-Sisi, returned to the president of the United Nations, the former general, who in 2013, the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of the country, the United States.
Misleading - this is the opinion of the president of the other man, who currently determines what is happening on the streets. Mohamed Ali remained of course abroad, where he evades the access of the security forces Younal, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago the 45-year-old actor was the only one of the country's minority to give his voice to the country's chief, today's cafe is known
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president clicks in luxury and gets built magnificent new palaces, it says. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he has been speaking for at least 15 years in his second profession as a contractor with precisely these gentlemen, he seems to know quite exactly how to do business.
After last week, for the first time since Sisi, thousands had demonstrated against his rule and nearly 2,000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested. This video was called for a "million march". That really so many people would dare to the streets, was unlikely. But it came to show that the protesters in the city of Kabul, including the prominent figures of the civil society, had been arrested.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters last week took down banners with the portrait of the president, they were torn to pieces by the army in 2013, and a massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and on the outlying roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed due to the "maintenance work", most of the streets were blocked by the Taz.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers", but as a retreat this is not to be understood: "All of Egypt is the Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different testing options.
If you enter into an internet contract, you don’t need to blindly trust the provider’s speed details. Customers can check for any abnormalities themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Center.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different testing options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"The tests of the suppliers, however, are carried out according to supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," the Bavarian Consumer Center points out on its side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days for the provider to produce the promised service.
This does not work, even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and may also demand damages. However, if there is no success, only help the grievance.
First ranking Republican for investigation
As the first-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont has spoken out for an impeachment inquiry against US President Donald Trump. "I think the inquiry is important, yes, and where it goes from here it is determined by the facts that will be determined," Phil Scott said at a press conference Thursday. He wants to lead more about the whistleblower's action before the president's impeachment affair.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine because Trump has been watching Biden "for years".
Republicans have withheld criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair so far; few have revealed discomfort. Scott’s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as easing environmental protection regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man Remains in MCU: Another Marvel Movie Planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the Tom Holland films should go on.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This is reported by several U.S. media in agreement. Accordingly, the cinema launch is already determined: The film is scheduled to start in the U.S. from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel Boos Kevin Feige quotes: "I'm glad that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He's the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony will never continue to bring the Spidey Verse to work on it."
But what about the sudden good news? Allegedly, Sony Marvel made an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, which also includes Marvel, would contribute 30 percent of the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man films, but the news is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the “Suits” final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the big finale in the USA. In the final episode there were many happy ends and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, was paid tribute in a charming way.
Forecast: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives showed once again the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess, such as the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how they greeted him after his imprisonment.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. "When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) walks straight to the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) actually makes a promising remark about his suit.
Aegean: Baby and four other children drowned in boat crash
A baby and four other children drowned when a refugee boat was caught in the Aegean Sea. A total of seven people died in the accident, according to the Greek Coast Guard on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the mainland of Turkey. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wanted to find out in Turkey "what about the refugee situation", Seehofer said on Friday, after which he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help cope with the situation.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed on Friday the planned trip of Seehofer with the EU Commissioner for the Interior Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Minister of the Interior Christophe Castaner.
An unusual number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive in Greece, with 654 people moving to the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in numbers recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who illegally come through Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, due to shortages of staff, the processing of the asylum applications is only difficult on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos are waiting for almost 29,400 people. The worst situation is on Lesbos: A camp with capacity for 650 people is currently housed 5,200 migrants.
There have never been so many since the EU-Turkey refugee pact entered into force in March 2016, the state broadcaster reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate changes are "quite sure" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system was affected by high temperatures and large temperature jumps.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo breakdown
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a reusable cup in her hand on a photo, but now it comes out: the cup has been manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has been unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw has never been held by Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website she was seen in a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also the Becher had been published nationally - and there
Green leader has to take responsibility for photo failure
The National Post then accused May of manipulating and producing fake news to appear more credible on the subject of “environmental protection,” in the midst of an election campaign for the House of Commons, in which Trudeau also struggled with a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked the discussion about fake news. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and proclaimed on her blog that she had no knowledge of this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she correctly put her, it was from bamboo. She always had it. A spokeswoman of the party said that it was not just about seeing the photo of the party logo and putting it under the picture.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she tells the Guardian, asking herself something from her over-engaged team: "If they want to edit a picture again, they couldn't do something with my face to make me look younger?"
The German Greens were also caught in Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de reported*.
Influencer wants free upgrade: lifetime ban on Cathay
According to allegations, Jaqueline Ng was guaranteed an upgrade by Cathay Pacific via mail, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Getting an upgrade to Business Class spontaneously – many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the check-in staff offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: a self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users on Instagram. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the outbound flight, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, despite showing an email allegedly prospecting her Cathay Pacific for an upgrade. The letter claims the influencer received from a marketing employee of the airline, while the airline accuses Jaqueline of faking the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK airport were skeptical: they followed up at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee, from whom the mail allegedly came, did not deny the mail contact with Jaqueline, also confirmed the mail system.
Airline staff at the airport cancelled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifetime flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her for the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains banned for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now hires a lawyer.
Oil prices fall after Yemen ceasefire report
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time possible on Friday afternoon. Most recently, a barrel (159 litres) of North Sea Brent cost $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The trigger for the price slide was a report by the Wall Street Journal about a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of world oil production to a halt. The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia blames Iran, like the US government. A ceasefire would bring political tensions in the region to a close.
If an agreement is actually reached, one can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the raw material strategy department at Saxo Bank, Bloomberg news agency.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost nearly $59, Brent nearly $65.
According to Bloomberg, after the attack in mid-September, oil plant repairs in Saudi Arabia are moving faster than expected, reaching a volume of eight million barrels per day and moving back towards the original volume.
Recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders reporting on the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco’s rapid progress in repair work, but commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning to go public and avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation was suggested in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after being detained by Iran and the recently granted clearance on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure as the ship continues to be anchored.
However, the U.S. announced that it would move missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia as the Iranian arch-enemy, and fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and Britain had occasionally driven oil prices up significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump are escalating
In the affair of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, allegations of cover-up against the White House have been loudly voiced by the Reuters spokesperson. “Several leading government officials have been intensively trying to prevent the White House from having access to the wording of the conversation after a disputed phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July.
North Korea considers Trump and Kim's third summits questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit in the nuclear dispute will soon be held by Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The U.S. had done nothing so far to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the adviser of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticized tightening U.S. sanctions and the joint military manoeuvres of the U.S. and South Korea, but he hoped for a "wise" and "courageous" decision by Trump to bring about a rapprochement again.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he declared himself willing to do so. Negotiations on a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, the two agreed to meet again in the large demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
Prince Harry: Weapon makers to help clear mines
Clothed in a blue splinter vest, Prince Harry symbolically ignited and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico he made the ignition circle. In a safe distance the explosives exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola free of mines by 2025, he later called on the countries to take the current TV camera.
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of a short-term interest rate cut, the pound is losing in value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculation on the Bank of England (BoE)'s imminent interest rate cut adds to the pound sterling, with the British currency falling by as much as 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The triggers of the sales were statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who brought a rate cut into the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was considered a proponent of a restrictive monetary policy by the Evangelista, Anatrarly said.
Last week, the Bank of England had already warned of the burdens on the economy due to the Brexit hack, without directly signaling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: The British Prime Minister has taken a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Kerstin Leitel, editor of Handelsblatt.
Doping: Further Russian manipulation proven
Material from the Moscow analytical laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the World Athletics Championship, new details about the doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy the few credibility that Russian sport had gained back at the beginning of the year and even at an early stage. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015.
In December 2014, systematic fraud had been revealed in Russian sport. On that the Wada had held the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) for three years in the summer. During this time Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee left after individual testing at the summer games 2016 in Rio the sport was held in the hosts of the Russian sport.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada Banner, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should reveal the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
The chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has stated that many of the Wrestlers have not received the data in January, but they have now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the correct data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurt general newspaper"
