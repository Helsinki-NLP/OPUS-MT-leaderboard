CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
CSSD’s new elected officials to the City Hall of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the city council level with their old and new colleagues in the SDG.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the city council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argot that was born in the last years in the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It has been discovered with surprise that the new elected officials do not very well understand the known terms.
At least they say so.
"Who's Valdemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm a fast in Prague politics," said Lukas Kaucky, the culture-elect, to test the vocabulary of the 'godfather'.
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, the elected Karel Brezina has reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"That's the only expression among the ones you suggest me to use."
Otherwise, I don't use the argon.
From the vocabulary, which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-electoral congress of the SDG, the editorial board chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", going to the pastry shop, "beef nerve", "betrayal of the capital" and "buriing".
Three of the elected officials agreed for the quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth-elected Petr Dolinek rejected the test.
"I am not concerned at all with these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I will not give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we will understand each other in our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the above legend, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
“This is the Blanka Tunnel,” Kaucky said, adding immediately: “But I know it from the newspapers.”
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen for the environment, know that the hole of golf is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of "going to the bakery".
“It’s, I think, going to a company,” Plachy is willing to guess that it’s Janousek’s headquarters.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that he derives his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary that he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no argot lexicon in social democracy.
“I have consulted with colleagues and it seems that we really don’t have something like that.”
"It's more like saying names sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, which members of the Party call Hulda.
“I was called Briza at school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” Brezina said.
The daily newspaper Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
Elected Weinert is either Grandpa for Party members or the least friendly Little Old Man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by scams during the party sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones admitted to using within the party by the Social Democrats.
It is said that Hulinsky does not like much to hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in the law of the baton" recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of doctor in law JUDr.at the police academy of Bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of “sorcerers,” a brochure has been published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, cannot work for health reasons for example, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has that destiny."
“Young healthy women are also not judged because they are participating in labor and giving birth to children,” says a sister who works in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He edited a brochure that should help limit witch hunting.
The case has a "hic".
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” the daily Die Standard warned of the inconvenience of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil sprinkled on her.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
The criminals claim it was the evil eye.
According to their version, the oil that is used for ritual anointings has ignited in contact with the woman.
The oil flared, it seems, when the team wanted to "chase the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Eaters of human spirits have always posed a danger," he says.
While Burkina Faso is striving to reduce witch hunts, Gambia has seen the President himself participate in it no later than last year.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt which, it appears, participated in his death and endeavored by black magic to kill the President as well."
“Shamans from nearby Guinea who came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal guard of the President, men and women chosen at random in villages in Gambia,” Amnesty International said in a message.
On the farm, imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
On international pressure, about 1,000 people were released.
Bakal tenant: The stoves are warming, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man came out of the door of the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying under his arm a file with three new leases for three apartments: his, his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 second category apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works on solid fuel," the man with the signature power pointed to his son's new contract.
"But I signed anyway," he said, angry and half resigned.
The citizen association of apartments BytyOKD.cz who described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to use to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" frowning.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After New Year's Eve, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic are waiting for, whose rents do not match the market price.
For this reason, Aktualne.cz decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
Only one press and one paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number as your number already starts lighting up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems as everywhere - requests for repairs, insurance events and so on.
In the Ostrava area, people from more than 44,000 RPG apartments have been receiving mail with the new leases in their mailbox since around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases from 15 percent to 38 percent.
The special desk for new rents has been open to the public since November 18.
"It's been working for nearly a week, so it's still trying," replies the employee behind the counter after a moment of hesitation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deragulation and the former Bakal miners’ apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the parliament and from the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported this quite sustainedly before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
“Twenty years after them, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change me a put...n board in the toilets, relieves in the introduction the mentioned man.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to make sure they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as promised RPG in a special offer.
This is a rebate of half the amount of rent that will be received by other tenants who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" counter on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by questions.
“Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent,” the employee said.
And yet RPG presents on its website as well as in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two sides do not agree on the rent, it is an independent court that will make the decision.
"It's not about threats, it's just about informing us about the unique and legitimate way to act legally," RPG said on its website.
"Here no one will go to court," thinks one of the RPG Byty employees and the man in the street in front of the customer center gives him his right.
“I have 13,000 retirement crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
“Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and so people wait,” she says.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the fund for housing," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the fund for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments, which is more than 90 percent of RPG apartments.
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," the screen says.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rent increase have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices included the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that it would also house a mini kindergarten with everything needed - colored walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of the employees of Arch. design can visit.
Architectural project company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its business mini-primary school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, mostly of the age to make children and it was important for women architects and project managers to be able to quickly return to work.
At the same time as reduced time employment contracts, the nursery school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work taking care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-primary school is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding grants (up to 2.8 million CZK), they were able to buy equipment and equipment and after two years to ensure qualified personnel as well as the start-up.
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini-primary school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to apply for the endowment.
Childcare is provided by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children throughout the day. Children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are over threeyears oldfor the most part.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more that replace each other.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without looking at the hierarchical position.
Although the program involves individual care and education, the mini-primary school curriculum is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children do not only play but quality education is also guaranteed - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches we teach English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of a delay to pick up the children from a school away from the parent’s workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is no wonder that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudi's interiors.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is how is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the locals the nickname of Bone House.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is typical for Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The front fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
At night the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
Wood waves copy window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of doors, eyelet and slats.
The Battlo house, which stands in the Eixample district on the Passeig de Gracia shopping street at number 43, was born from the construction of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-dwelling house was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations for a representation apartment of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade were born.
For the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Park Guell in which there are other works of Gaudi.
Locals nicknamed the hot house just after its finish because of its organic shapes "the Bone House".
Others, given the specific mechanism of opening the windows, have called it "la maison qui baille".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the building contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation, Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction guidelines of the time and did not allow himself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the building permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
For example, the members of the city council did not like the pillars of the construction to be encroached on the public sidewalk.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire house of six floors is shared by a staircase through which you access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the lounges and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has received a new facade a non-traditional roof and two floors in addition.
Gaudi’s play with the light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with the lighthouses.
The two-color play gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark, which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house which was inscribed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the visits as they found it to be a lucrative business and they expanded the scope of visits to the common areas and attic including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in Gaudi's other constructions in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you need to quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a mattress: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the area reserved for bedtime, so the mattress and bedside give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive,:the weight, height, age, health status as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and bed is to be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where one does not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not suitable because they "heat" gently.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels at the heart and if they stay on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who spends time abroad, where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a softening layer, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
“That’s how all the hokey players who come back from the NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
"For their tired shoulders, feet, and ribs, they needed mattresses with a sluggish layer of foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder which therefore misunderstands the "information" of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses for example.
You don't have to be an NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This “miracle” simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t turn around at night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against squares.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a two-seater bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should lay your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly folded. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators who has been devoted for several years to the problem of a healthy sleep.
For a two-seater bed everyone needs their own mattress and mattress, so be careful however during the finish to choose the height of the mattress properly.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the bed base at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of this count for the shape and aeration layer at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of bed.
The bed-bed, when the mattress and the bed-bed are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since at night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and blocked) screen.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make a claim for a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But all to his own advantage.
And for this an expert advice from the vendors: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the lining of the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even though nowadays it is common to make zipper coverings for the whole set, that is, after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise the handling for large models (and for a single person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a bed sheet?
Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bag springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position slatted beds with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are lined in the lower part of the kidneys as well as possible.
For multi-position mattresses it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the lamellae, it is also possible to install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special connection of the lamellae which makes it possible to press or even tilt the lamellae so that the shoulder of the sleeper "fits" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as the back", this is really an important thing.
This is already contemplated by the mattress manufacturers who for "males" began to use a scrolling area at the shoulders.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or wafer beds with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads over more points and diminishes the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen with air) on good mattresses and bedside, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians prefer, for example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle of the bed or the area rammolled in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also on the organic mattress.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soy.
“The Bio label for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” explains Petr Vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender scents.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract of birch plants so that the lining of the mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the lining "heats" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disrupted cellular structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffness of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are located.
You will pay for a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for the mattress and the mattress is not easy.
One can from time to time have two mattresses for the price of one as part of special actions from manufacturers or producers.
As for example the company Magniflex which offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur matter at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This started as a matter for NASA because astronauts were suffering from huge load factors at the start.
Tempur melts in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this against poor sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and the venous system.
For example, Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, initially set up to search for cars, can just as well be used to track people's movement and help in some cases, such as that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a match box but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying, but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," said Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the Czech market's tracking equipment suppliers.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware of it, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know what "box" is used for and how to use it in an emergency.
The children's psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child does not want to carry something of this type on him, he will get rid of it.
“And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can cut off like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long waits,” Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If it's a prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything to ensure that the child doesn't have an electronic device that can locate him."
"At the moment, it's the phone."
"As soon as tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help in an attack not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The device may be set to be in regular transmission after a specified period of time."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, there is still the last position of the person concerned."
"The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately indicates the position of the person who slipped and ends up in a lying position without moving," Cech said.
According to him, so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special software.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to the ones that are pendant the size of a matchbox or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracing device."
"Either he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of GPS position acquisition systems (usually used in autonavigation) and a cell phone function that alerts a vehicle to its current position.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could go around the Czech Republic with it, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence bought 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating cords from the company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as reason for the completion of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to reserve calculations made by army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosives exercise each year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence, and Vlastimil Picek, Commander of the Army are no exceptions.
Just to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
At this distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army's reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient to more than 2 m of detonating cords, as the experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with the consumption also of special units and genius - reserves for the mentioned 225 years.
However, soldiers in the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
We don't talk about the lack of body laundry.
"And I don't mind if they buy so many detonating cords from us."
“And it’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
"For us the army is a good customer that we as traders strive to satisfy," said STV Group Commercial Director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that the army will have these "ammunition" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, said that the lifespan of the detonating cords and the pyrotechnicians of the police and army was only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can go as long as four years," said one who did not want his name to be published given the criticism of the army.
The past life span, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrity and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests, however, are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of stringed detonators.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said Pejsek, a spokesman for the defense ministry.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnics that neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for the safety of pyrotechnics and to be able to obtain more flexibly more modern and reliable types of detonating cords.
the ministry of defense today has major problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading towards the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating ropes that it buys today "inexpensively".
To this day, I take advantage of the contacts that I have gained through the contests.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun well for the place of winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur contest.
Last year’s winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Liberec lacked a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the second year of graduate school, it was a brave action.
“The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our area made me want to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building that he converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Liberec 4 guest houses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year there was another one of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel at Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other Pytloun hotel franchise candidates showed up," the number one contractor last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year served well," adds Pytloun with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant,” he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he is still using his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained in any other way.
"With those I met through the contest I started to maintain business relationships regularly.
According to him, the fame related to the success had an impact on the employees as well.
And he's about 70.
“I observe in them above all the loyalty and pride of being committed to something that has been generally recognized.”
“This is by far not the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to pick up the prize at Slovansky dum for the first place in the competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
"I can say that the award has not only encouraged me and my employees and has increased our self-confidence to fight the competition," said the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not long after they began to specialize in presses for vegetable oil.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success of the contest through the media.
“Not only have our customers started to really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who have started to realize that they are collaborating with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not pass at Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic results of 2008 and part of 2009.
And in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"Obviously, we have not escaped this situation."
“Turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off,” says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained beneficial results even if they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built with the endowments a training and research center, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions and won major awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything makes us think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees goes up, and with them the number of employees as well.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes insane regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be removed.
The less glorious winner of this year's Inquiry into the Absurdity of the Year was the obligation to bring documents to the offices that officials can obtain online.
More than one-third of the 4000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administrations requested a paper excerpt from the trade register while the grievor can get it with two mouse clicks.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer ask for an excerpt from the trade register for insurance payment checks," said Jana Buranova, spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Bringing out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must comply with in the Czech Republic and removing those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the absurdity of the year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has yet more popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters protested, it was at least 4,000 this year who brought their voices.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that are only slowing down the business, and,this, more and more.
"We may be in the number of documents to complete for tax returns in the top places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurship has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th in terms of terms and conditions for the company, 8 places more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first established in 2006 and continues each year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, the last time before the competition closes.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity who received the most votes is declared the winner.
Until the last inquiry last year, about 100, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees, have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by the entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, so among the nominees is, for example, the obligation that motorway and expressway maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees paint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always begins at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
"Economic prosperity can't work when the state puts ties in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
The effort to suppress absurd decrees is not a blow in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the contractors' obligation to report three days in advance to the office for the individual company to where the company is located, intending to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most acclaimed obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was removed with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by an order from the Ministry of Health last year-the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible companies.
Ecological, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The new feature of this year’s Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Firm Responsible of the Year 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and carry out socially responsible activities," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the company Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the competition of the company of the year 2010, organized by the company Vodaphone, registered companies that do not have success with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their supportive and forecasting activity can be viewed as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns people with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not an example of the software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which for 17 years has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities.
The old paper factory in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of its employees, earned the title of the company responsible for the Central Bohemian region and placed third in the region in the competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for introducing relaxed working hours and even reduced to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, a reduction in wages.
The jury also awarded it the title because it buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports a Ditoyan activity in the surroundings and is concerned with the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,” said Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work from home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
“We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation that helps the local Roma community,” said Ondrej Suchy, the company’s representative.
In the last place is, also for its activities, a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, increased qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company of bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesia region.
All the regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition, who had replied to the questionnaires attached to the registration document and sent it back to the organizer by August 15, were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category.
Incomplete or incorrect answers in the questionnaire were removed from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the companies in competition had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the contest of the company Responsable but were not disqualified from the competition "principal" the Firm of the Year of Vodaphone".
"Independent registrations are not possible because this is a subcategory of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of organizer agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, the police carried out arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have carried out arrests in recent days.
Detectives handed the handcuffs to the local contractor and real estate trader Lubos. G.
The latter had endeavoured to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of an application for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a particular candidate.
He was to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For now I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for an insider offense in the context of a public tender and competition," Plzen prosecutor Antonie Zelena told the newspaper Pravo, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police released the 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in light of so little official information.
At a question from Pravo, the spokeswoman for the Lubomira Cerna Lands Fund said that the police had actually carried out an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and not an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has the real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is put in place when several beneficiary candidates appear.
"These individuals propose, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their restitution rights that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of the buyers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the Fund's spokesman explained.
Lubos G. had, of course, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the appeal and, as he himself is, also one person benefitare because, having purchased a large number of restitution rights, he had proposed to the candidates on the ground not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably getting paid by retiring.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Fonds des Terrains).
It included the case of the former head of FDT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for publishing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been published.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the access artery to the industrial zone of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The town hall was obliged to accept because otherwise it risked putting the construction in jeopardy by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional one hundred crowns per month for housing.
Households will have to pay an additional charge from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
As of January, families will have to draw up to a hundred crowns a month from their wallet.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas almost 2 percent more expensive, in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth of the water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity for apartment households is expected to be around 100 kronor more annually than at present.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the sensitive development in encouraging the manufacture of renewable energies, particularly photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
One can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan for price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay nearly 50 more crowns per month for central heating from January, Liberec families will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing a 9 percent increase for water and sanitation in case the city increases the rents of infrastructure.
If the rents do not change the pragues will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will rise significantly in the 450,000 apartments to be rented from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by the company.
Regulated rents people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer in fashion and acts very gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from children's departments of hospitals.
“Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk.”
"The trend is really to strong alcohols," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department at Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a daddy bottle in the closet, it's sometimes whisky but it's fernet and vodka that prevail."
"Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not smell it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, also said she was right.
"Usually it's rum or fernet."
"It's now alcohol in fashion, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the head of the Pelikan department, seeing drunken children aged 13 to 14 on hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he worked for 10 years in pediatrics, where ambulances brought schoolchildren from completely drunken areas.
A young girl was hospitalized four times.
"She started her career at the age of twelve when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Centre at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterestedness of the parents or their unusual tolerance for the fact that their offspring indulge in drinking that are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to specialists, however, there is no talk of addiction, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the term alcoholic we hear a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result but that we do not find in children."
"For those who use acool repeatedly, it is rather a significantly unfavourable socio-family background," Pelikan said.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after emergency care by parents or police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan, he excites three seasonal waves that can be counted on: Witch's Day, Saint Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink in spite of bad results or on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"Of course, I experienced the admission of seven drunk children at once on Witch Day," Pelikan said.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who went home and suffers the day after the "hangover".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off for this because they have a great evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
“They’re just amazed at where they’re at,” Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils patients’ good mood at least with the bill to pay for their care.
Ambulance transportation and intensive care bed hospitalization can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
“Once in a while, I have applied this as a means of education by telling these children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to reimburse a single evening,” Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regressive management, which should recover from parents the burdens of care, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, for which the Ministry of Defense exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time such aircraft have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were previously in service in the Czech army and were in a state of flight.
The remaining three devices are single-seater versions of the L-159.
These are currently parked at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defense’s press department, the physical departure of Vodochody’s planes is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft intended for exchange were taken on long-storage aircraft without causing any additional burdens or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 two-seaters were exchanged in the state," Pejsek told Pravo.
He argued that the military would not be without two-seaters as the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek EADS pledged to introduce the aircraft into the equipment of certain Alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159 aircraft are EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore up to the one who is considering how to do this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
The defense leadership then argued that the exchange ensures future export of the L-159 overseas.
The Czech army bought from Aero Vodochody 72 aircraft and only uses 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will likely have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European-wide tender and under no circumstances by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have the index longer than the annular are at a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This can depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple prostate cancer risk test, especially for men before age 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining it with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed up with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the annular the risk fell to 33 percent, however, for men before 60 the decrease in risk reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but that it does not appear to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic like most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, clearers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile Central Club (UAMK) told the news
At the 91st kilometre a truck was crashed, at the 93rd two heavy vehicles hit each other, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the highway D1 at 185th kilometer towards Prague.
Two trucks hit there.
Drivers should leave just after Brno for the 190th kilometre or go through Brno and then enter the 182nd kilometre in Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Lines of cars are created for example in Prosek, Sterboholska street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are delayed for example on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff has yet to meet.
Railroads and the airport are also facing problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove due to snow 7 rapid links.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 a.m. in the night until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rollable but with due diligence.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impractical, on the road to Brno there begins to be snow gusts in places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain communication routes in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected areas.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
In order to clean them, it may be necessary to send snow cleaners and snow strawberries.
At the moment, we cannot estimate when they will be rollable.
On the Hodonin road, caution must be exercised in the White Carpathian region.
On roads that are, for the sake of nature, maintained only by the sprinkling of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In Czechia, it fell between two and 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, often with up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snowfall in the Czech Republic gradually disappeared.
The Americans have a new "intelligent weapon"
The U.S. military sent a new “smart” weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the code XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its projectiles are laser-guided with a precision of a few meters.
The special ammunition of 25 mm caliber developed for this rifle and containing a highly breakable explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode at contact with the target but also at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when a deadly rain of steel splinters falls on it, it can also put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends it a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise sighting point, according to which he corrects his sighting site and presses on the trigger.
"Let's say you targeted at 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the gun loads and fires at a distance of 543 meters or so 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 relocated jobs
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their current workplace to Astro Park at the office building on Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, so far located on Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman said that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together another 100 jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and Astro Park’s open-plan offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
CEO Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure for us."
He argues that the connection to the airport is precisely of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company inside the region yesterday sparked the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of establishment".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
Management informed the municipality of this intention very early on.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly relationships could not have changed the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding such an exceptional place to remain unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Town Hall Square building, used so far by the Fujitsu company and the neighboring "small vertical" as well as the rest of the buildings in Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
As a result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the train station and the City Hall, which was widely criticized, not only for the impressive layout of the areas that used to be partly parking, but also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment consulting company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, then still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurter Immobilien-Chancen group acquired the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, is considered the world’s third-largest provider of IT products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to companies and also provides the essential service.
Its branch located in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu has certainly many more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to move to Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, named after its star-shaped plan, is home to the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronics and Electrotechnical Industry.
Amazon's eviction from server - Threats to Mr Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude may conceal political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder Mr Assange is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with increasing force.
The group of cyber-activists "WikiLeaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to news reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the land of freedom," said Wednesday (local time) the cyber activists behind the revelations via Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the release of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to achieve the greatest number of access to documents.
Wikileaks tweeted: “Formidable, our dollars are now spent caring for people in Europe.”
When freedom of expression poses a problem for Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Liebermann’s office, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks from using its servers after an investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman’s collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper, The Guardian, reported.
"I wish that Amazon had taken this step earlier in view of Wikileaks' previous publications of classified information," he said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of the servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously, putting our national security at risk and endangering lives around the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No company conscious of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the contents of the stolen documents.”
Wikileaks founder Mr Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently labeled Sweden’s prosecution of him as intrigues orchestrated by his critics.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats had been made against the site.
"There have even been calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of WikiLeaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that those responsible for Wikileaks’ revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the adviser to the head of government Mr. stephen Harper said on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for President Barack Obama, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Russell Travers, deputy director of the Centre for Counter-Terrorism, has been named responsible for fighting the leaks.
Mr. Travers is tasked with implementing “the necessary structural reforms” made indispensable after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has a willingness to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if it proves necessary.”
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. the somewhat outdated ice confectioner in German, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The ice cream maker founded the University of Ice in 2003 so that the ice creams from its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice cream are also offered over several days, as well as hands-on sessions in the private ice cream shop.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk fulfilling their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, an art education professor from California, is passionate about the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product to the country of industrial ice in the future.
Anke de Berlin is a consultant in business management and, after a few years, she wants to draw a few peculiar things from this nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive not only is the good flavor, but also the silky suppleness and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a lot of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a tap installed on the machine: he pulls out a white cream of pasteurized base, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately attacked by the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warned against being misled by the spirit of time.
Anyone who speaks only of ice cream "made from natural ingredients", may still have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will crochet nothing but ice pellets.
Some modifications to the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one acquires in the fruit or confectionery department of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"The suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when cocoa powder is added to it, forms the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must move to the use of ice machines.
Luciano occasionally invites them to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experiment.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of walnut, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The popular kiwi ice cream is made from the group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture correctly enhances the taste of an ice cream,” says Luciano.
Making ice is a calculating exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (winners use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, tables make calculations easier.
Ice making no longer requires as much physical intervention as it used to.
It’s not just the automatic base mass making machine that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it creamy and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo shaves fruit puree from head to toe and thus splashes his schoolmates when control of the colossal mixer bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "an incident like this is likely to occur in every course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiments with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has drowned the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve been well informed,” Christoph Then, Testbiotech’s director, told Munich on Wednesday.
Some reports indicate that the chairman of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of the EFSA test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest, according to Mr. Then's criticism.
The requirements developed correspond, by paragraphs, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the trade mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities established in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period. In doing so, She changed camp.
A short time ago, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relationships between the controlling authority of the European Union and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions from both the German Federal Environment Agency and Members of the European Parliament.
However, the EFSA does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, is used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from making contacts with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) based in the United States.
It sees itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feed tests and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We would like to know what, for example, the incidences of genetically modified corn are causing the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results to be obtained.
"If we do not look for the risks, how can we then discover them?" asks Mr. Then in an accusatory tone.
This is also the point of view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck argues that "industry controls safety research".
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell got it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart railway station with her tube on her back.
There was a march.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and started to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billions.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations resulted in the halt of construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He obtained a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He says enthusiastically: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claimed that by cutting it in the saw, he smelled the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The traces of Stuttgart's stones lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tübingen, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared in the landfill," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He said he was subjected to insults and threats when newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the North Wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for full days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stone.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took away one of the stone parallelepipeds weighing an average of 80 kilograms with a value of between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
Approximately half are still piled up in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took away everything that could enter the trunk and trailers.
These stones of Stuttgart scandal have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"This political component would never have been the case."
He enters his all-terrain car, touring his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He graduated from law and later began studying biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a carrier.
And a lover of stones.
It holds 40,000 tons.
He gathers treasures all over Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's slowing down.
Sandstones carved with art are laid on the snow.
"They used to be part of the bridge from Marienbrücke to Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
He shows a pile of his finger: Red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And so on.
"Just travertin."
The parallelepiped was once part of the stand at the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the St. Blasian Cathedral, the tuf from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were once carved by hand and moved by means of simple hoists and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be shattered."
He did not become rich, let alone rich.
But this carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon, he has to go to Cologne.
There are stones to be saved, too.
Fighting Talents to Conquer High Potentials
The counter has a strong influx.
16 students scramble to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and white-eaters.
Braunschweig University of Technology and Volkswagen have invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of idea competition, they have to talk business about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen company.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand-in-hand in competition to find better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in the amphitheaters before they reach the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to spot exceptional talents in practical projects and retain them.
On the second day of the workshop held at the technical university of Brauschweig, the car group starred talents.
A young lady from the staff department shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs to young talents; she shows them the paths to access the group's premises.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industry and gain experience."
“As for the Volkswagen Group, he can get to know the students, take a closer look at serious candidates and appreciate those who come into account as an employee.”
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we seek to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much harsher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting through a series of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and, above all, court the highly skilled workforce.
Above all, graduates from engineering fields are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineer positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI forecast, the void for engineer positions will widen further.
Roman Dykta goes on talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, an auditing, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel through the United States in this way.
Participants can visit KPMG subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who has to participate in the selection process decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used for the pursuit of high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the count seems to be there.
“To this day, we have stayed in touch with everyone who took part in a similar action last year.”
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from direct on-campus milling, small and medium-sized enterprises do quite classically by participating in trade fairs where they engage in brain-hunting.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
“For example, at the solar technology fair,” says Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are being contested on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
“It’s expensive and it takes a lot of time,” he said.
Another way to establish contact is to go through university professors.
Solarworld has established a cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example the University of Fribourg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to complete professional internships or write his or her final study project with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are being announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do this," says Staff Chief Stübe.
For a long time, money has no longer played a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotional opportunities are other decisive factors.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers.
The institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, he asks employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of the employees.
The Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among job seekers.
“I think candidates rely mostly on external assessments for a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German DEBA (Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal action.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through their own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, that is, the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best messengers."
When employees are treated well and they identify with the company, they advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” says Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the southeastern state of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued an equivalent ban and thus definitively cancelled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains banned for the time being.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling rig in April is the cause of this strict ban, which is expected to remain in effect for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which cost 11 employees the lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize the construction of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in golf has not yet been definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces multi-billion-dollar claims, is at the center of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is expected to present its findings this December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze decreed after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter control measures and tighter security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous corruption charges, is currently undergoing in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that they would remove the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
The players in this sector of activity are now publicly warning that the supply flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has so far been.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to the results of a current survey conducted in the sector by the audit firm BDO, ahead of the drilling ban pronounced on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing into the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a smell similar to that existing in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live on theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't get exhausted," the environmental activist told reporters to calm them: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man plunged into muddy water all the way to his chest, as well as the greasy trail that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the rainbow-colored splash of water.
We cannot see that the basement is full of brown sheets of crude oil.
On the shores of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that she used to collect shrimp in whole buckets here.
In the meantime, the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil poured out of an oil pipeline that exploded into the huge swamp.
Fishermen in the nearby small town of Bodo must now ro rowing for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The whole extent of the ravages is obvious when you walk through the mangrove swamps crossed by streams.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits a brown cradling water. Whoever immerses his hand in it removes it all covered with oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. The isolated palms sadly let their palms hang.
In vain we search for the clouds of birds, as we usually encounter them in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of old that resembles a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What's going on here is war on the environment," said Celestine Akpobari with a sad voice: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger in terms of health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The Ogoni region has been a besieged battlefield for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered this area; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. This was later executed. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because their employees had become very dangerous for them.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 wells and 7000 kilometers of oil pipelines throughout the entire Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the country Ogoni are unexploited, because the situation is too unexploited.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of steel trellises like bizarre sculptures: The heads of drill holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most are eaten by corrosion up to the mark.
Akpobari estimates that a drill head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces, because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters of oil have been spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that flowed into the sea during the crash of the super-oil tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should be responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides actors.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and siphoning of pipelines is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, while environmentalists consider drill head explosions and perforated pipelines to be the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell Group of applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failures is "even higher than alloys".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of camouflages and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with camouflages to the neck.
A fire flashes under one of the many barrels that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without pattern on the site must be found: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
At first, the gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the pipe the drops of kerosene fall and diesel is finally obtained.
Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $ 22.
The people of the Delta are taking advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents per liter of diesel: because they buy their raw material free of charge.
According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a very small part of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military personnel, load the lion’s share into tankers and burst it into the world market.
The activist Akpobari believes that the debate on whether to attribute the environmental catastrophe or rather the subversive activities to the population or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries.”
But, in the meantime, Ogoni's relations especially with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of the group's withdrawal. "maybe operators with other nationalities, like the Chinese, will prove better."
Then Michael becomes nervous.
"It's high time you got out of here," says the tough oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mostly from the north of the country intend to benefit from the raw material like all Nigerians.
“At every point of view, this damn thing has brought our country down very low,” Akpori said.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 obviously suffers from a major safety issue.
By examining an aircraft that performed an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
At the beginning of November, passengers on the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had apparently been more fortunate so far: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety issue, and it warned of a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue creeks and leaks at the level of the connection of the oil pipe, it is indicated in a position statement published on Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a “catastrophic failure of the reactors.”
The reactors manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft of the A380 series are concerned.
The Quantas airline's Airbus, which had to emergency land on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now filed lawsuits against the British manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas's director, Mr. Alan Joyce, said his company would claim damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the ignition of oil that is causing the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had immobilized its entire fleet of A380s on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380s.
The airline Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-story aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall all over the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany creepy: Due to icy temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered in snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they were unable to overcome the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects that tidal waves will occur on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow clusters on motorways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the bad weather alert central Meteomedia announced the level of violet alert was announced in the Saxon Switzerland: in fact, this is the highest level.
In some places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong, cool winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck at night.
Even in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic disruptions and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to the Deutsche Bahn, serious disruptions in rail traffic have occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees falling on railway tracks, catenaries or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, interregional transport between Leipzig and Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfall has resulted in numerous flight cancellations at major German airports.
According to a spokesman for the standard and flight information, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no more passengers stuck at the airport, despite this, only 400 beds are made available to them.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car barrelled on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: Snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to news reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's headquarters: the twin towers located in the Business District have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper writes, citing a spokesman.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said, “We’re checking if it’s more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or sell them, and put them back for rent later.”
Germany’s largest financial institution has already divested its headquarters, shortly afterwards.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of EUR 272 million from the equity holders and then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization have, according to some indications, engulfed around 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, meanwhile renamed "Green Towers", at about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the safety situation of the well remains precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors aged between 17 and 62 years had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and administration had considered that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
Until now, the bodies could not be raised.
Today, relatives and friends organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered in bright sunshine at Greymouth, south of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal belongings, including clothes and surfboards, were also included.
The flags were placed in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the commemorative party attendees that New Zealand has nurtured hope that the miners will rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said he cannot resign himself to accepting the death of his son until he sees his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Miners of South African and British origin were also buried in the first explosion of November 19.
Rescuers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are displaced, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", the fighter's epic.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he made Walhalla Rising?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after another. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for a bloody action, precisely because our hero is using methods of brutal assassination.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind man doesn't say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let out, at most, with one or two sentences a few horrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and celebrated in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
This would be ideal for more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent traveling.
When a film targets multiple target groups, it is a pity that they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy about the fierce and stylish drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to art and trial cinema.
Most fans of art cinema must experience horror at the brain that spreads around and into the intestines.
The lovers of action movies die of boredom, when the blind man embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship destined for Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributors in Germany and that it exists only in the DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It’s not about dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is ambience, a feverish dream turned into a film.
The spectator cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a gloomy soundtrack, but especially with an elusive hatred that emanates from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who stands faithfully by the side of the blind, preserves some innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by turning himself into a warrior, is perhaps the devil's envoy himself.
It represents rottenness, but perhaps so, only for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can hate or admire, whose purpose is annoyance, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 at around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates River; the largest nearby city is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in the IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria has built appears with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a U.S. intelligence briefing, the CIA, dating back to late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring locality, el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium, which would make it possible to manufacture atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video with fuzzy satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the power plant that represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the nearby building, or even the interior of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is barely more information available than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery gets thicker and thicker.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little evidence showing that the country was developing “an active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a “presumed reactor,” even if they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “plausible.”
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he is making sure he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior U.N. diplomat only gave a laconic answer in the summer by claiming that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions."
The Syrians certainly removed the rubble of the "unused military building" in a hurry and proceeded with a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial providers from a Member State showing the moment that followed the attack directly; it seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus argues that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analyzing the particles, calling it unlikely.
Since that time, Damascus has refused any discussion about it, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow inspectors to conduct a second inspection at the site of el-Kibar and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains stubbornly silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
Thus, the investigation into the case has been prolonged since June 2008 without a result and is "increasingly turning into a serious problem of the credibility of the Agency", as acknowledged by a high-ranking Western diplomat serving at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities are involved here, what their function is or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA by the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah respectively also by the names of the neighboring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is at or directly next to a military base, which is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites by IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it was intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that drew the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, that vehicles have shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve for fuel production."
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are indispensable for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental questions: where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could conceal valuable traces, was stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of land-loaded trucks have disappeared, no one will have information on where the rubble is stored.
According to the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometers from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing satellite photos taken on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos show, however, that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspicious sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to those locations.
It may have been a coincidence, but it did not help to rule out suspicions.
It is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for the inspections to be carried out there, which was intended to allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only the time invested shows the great interest of the inspectors in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus also dismissed this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador who has been evoking for a few months what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Agency has to implement its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitating.
This means involves a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there do not want to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: "Will it be useful, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
“It’s been bad since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing else is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response, certain shooting sequences scheduled for Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is being shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet with the actress.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she proposed to these women to meet them in Hungary, but they declined to do so.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's script tells quite a lot about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights remove Angelina Jolie as a goodwill ambassador.
But by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its screenplay, granted Sarajevo a shooting permit after a few hesitations, but it is not clear why it did not come afterwards despite this permission.
The young author herself asserts that she is not pursuing political objectives with her film, that she has made herself aware of the Yugoslav conflict by making a lot of effort. She argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all stakeholders the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other long before the beginning of the war. It meets again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with his executioner".
That Jolie’s film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, as Jolie puts it, is "unfair and based on erroneous information".
Now, only the Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario on the net, like so many others before.
Let's go!
Tonight, everything is fine again with the Irish.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team over-dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy against the backdrop of loud music, they twinkle feet.
Baileyu-Pub of Cork in South Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in the beer cups of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong". The winner pockets 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend in January in Las Vegas at the World Beer-pong Championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don’t go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old tries to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his plans. In January, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling,” he says.
"The home country is so far away and I have no job there."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, his brother Colin now holds a computer consultant position in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even predict a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are realized, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to the one Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now takes all the place.
The economic crisis, however, mainly affects the well-trained young Irish, who have so far only experienced moments of happiness.
The loss of jobs and social decay seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there is money in excess.
But, in the meantime, three in ten people under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes abundantly letters from readers written by young emigrants, complaining: “In Ireland, everything is drifting.”
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the possibilities, is leaving and our country is going to be a whole generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, chair of the Irish Students' Union, sees a darker future pointing because the government is just throwing powder in the eye and offering young people no prospects for the future.
“They’re cutting minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades cling from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She says that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon hosts the "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers full support on the theme of "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the head.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland for the 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house rises from the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hanover or Berlin.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, in order to be able to complete the repayment of the loan contracted to build his home in the home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I practically don't live anymore."
He bursts out of an embarrassed laughter as he crosses the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by the credit.
“These were moments of insanity, no doubt, money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid to see everything fall apart because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, ressits hot tea and says, "I don't have children to care for and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations he hears often lately.
"Nobody should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island," he said.
“Working abroad for a while isn’t the worst thing that can happen, maybe it’s what makes us feel Irish at first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
He was back after spending seven years there and, in Ireland, life just went on.”
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future and discover how life is going elsewhere.
In his charts, He already has a few years of work in London, which is why life in New Zealand should not be as easy for him and for his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that has worried him greatly in recent days: the party to be held on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He fears she can't turn into a farewell party.
"Only not a lot of emotions," he said, drinking a long sip of beer.
"Goodbye, it still sounds worrying."
“Let’s call it a goodbye evening, relaxed, bringing together a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it monitors changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the fairly sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after experiencing a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, lowering the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with how their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase from 25 per cent in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a sharp increase from 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
If this has endured during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many of America’s countries have suffered only a brief recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say they or a loved one has been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the disasterd and fearful country.
Voting boxes and a new poll were presented, ballots scattered in the gutters, ransacked polling stations and intimidation
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, wandered around the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, denounced the fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, sees the event as "a fairly good election in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they did not “believe that these irregularities, however serious, had necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents owe the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no noticeable support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reaches the second round.
With a raging cholera outbreak, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, we were worried that participation would be.
In the event, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so due to disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 ID cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stake is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate from 20 points to over 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Ms. Fernández's choice, apparently in mourning, whether or not she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to draw up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the additional income at will.
Ms Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more room to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage demands see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
It called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices of agricultural exports from Argentina.
But inflation eroded the growth boost following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs of wanting to re-establish Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused an earlier forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; which looks like a prelude to the remediation of INDEC.
It is unclear whether Ms. Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If it does, it needs to gain the support of the middle class, among whom Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have recurred.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, quietly, many of her husband’s policies.
Half an hour for China
Taiwanese voters have moved towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of eligible voters, stood on November 27 to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts as part of what is considered a general assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for sentiments towards the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just so.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five town halls, it failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned towards Taiwan’s full independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT by 45%.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of Taiwan’s elections, including bustling campaign trucks and mass rally flags with girls dancing in minimal costumes.
A compulsory mysterious assassination attempt was also perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Link, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Either way, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the killing had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking how absent the question of the mainland itself was.
Instead, the candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stirring up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable for Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation of whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It is expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the cradle.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to host a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let’s start from the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to jail on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is making every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, like Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party is presenting a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to run for presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT has to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's valuations were weak; despite dizzying economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said his cabinet and local offices would be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Award nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the "Best New Artist" category
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to take notice of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of this year’s Grammy Awards surprises with a major nomination in the “Best New Artist” category.
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure in the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but is consistent with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes that artist's public identity."
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding compared to the jaw-dropping success of Norah Jones in 2003.
Elsewhere, Grammy Awards voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "Instrumental Album" category, a thrilling ride on a recording that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite in New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; which is also leaning heavily towards a certain merger with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Wild Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, familiar with steampunk, won some well-deserved recognition in the big ensemble category; competing with Billy Childs Ensemble's rich chamber-jazz and eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose live octet's album "Pathways" was a fine example of the bassist's democratic hand as a group leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations are "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for the piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman’s Madolin Concerto is also in a race for an award.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; the "Sacrificium" of the Verquiem.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Royal Opera House National Orchestra; "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra
Composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he aviat wrote the 15-minute work specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performances, for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received a nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only solo vocalist nominees; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixes, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: my life, my song"
The project of the Temecula Mosque won the approval of the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics attacked the project claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center complied with local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention it," Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said Thursday morning.
“I am proud of that as an American citizen.”
"It shows that justice wins."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
“They just have very loud voices.”
"We have good people in this valley."
The session started at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the center, speaking time roughly equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the 9/11 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence in Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of about 135 families has co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and stand 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal this bill to the city council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very peculiar, even though it's far from being a truly 'foreign' form of life," said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the researchers found that the bacterium, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We are wondering what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in searching for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not leak the details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could divulge the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to trigger biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute for Planetary and Spatial Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a chance discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances might be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms have a hard time distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and, somehow, erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar said.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth's existence, she says; thus, researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at first," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen show dogs have been found in Compton
The other two exhibition dogs on four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, Los Angeles County sheriffs said Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore says.
“They are in good shape.”
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
“An investigation is underway.”
“We don’t want to say that,” Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas — Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female — were safe and sound, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until they were discovered Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national championship "AKC/Eukanuba" in Long Beach, where they planned to introduce Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly one-month canine exhibition tour.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's flight at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is unclear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is no longer waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially praised creditors' "pre-packaged" plan that said about $5 billion of the debt would be erased; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing films and TV shows.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, there are no legal obstacles left before MGM to recover under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will be a light studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility to fund MGM's new operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself is running into $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Moelis and Cooper to resolve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the $2 billion more that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team had begun working on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exits bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already obtained $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which raised $375,000 a month for their company’s management services, will receive a $4 million “success award.”
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch production of MGM, which has only released one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit," with Warner Bros.
The studio has to make a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share in the two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, has attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the top candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is the iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make an important breach in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that one Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic beads jumping strings, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
Clearly Moore's Law has evolved, this year's tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known of their kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are plush toys the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you press them on their stomach.
One pressure is equal to a note, and a second one allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several of them, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and up) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays games in turn like Simon Says and can do lunar dancing thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and older), with a backpack filled with game cards questionnaire designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve binder.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3-8-year-olds) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as efficiently as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3-12-year-olds), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer, brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, for 3-7-year-olds) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card input that allows viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a match box, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, this is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Club Penguin pet online, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years old) which includes a coin marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough Club Penguin Store credits for two items of choice.
These can be roller skates or a toy pet Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and up) is the latest button-cell micro-robots.
The fake beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to China’s law enforcement
Tang Shenbin roamed a town square as an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve charges, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan – imposing officials of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence – to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Stand up straight!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, he said, "What do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely gone through adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical olive jackets and pants, froze at the guard.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four well-groomed hats perfectly perched at the top of hair tied by a blue and white striped knot.
“Personally, I think they have an average appearance,” Tang said, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a higher education degree.
The Guangdong province exchanged the gray-green of uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the colporter packed his belongings and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police force of 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, shape and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulty catching the eye on this underground urban brigade from China
And for good reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media is portraying the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and put online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon picker was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available via online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained in assaulting street vendors.
"Chengguan has marked the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year, after a further controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real thorough cleaning."
Skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if the women had real tasks or if they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five face features in the right order."
They must be larger than the average size, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at 26 is mandatory.
The officers said the work was physically too painful for women over the age of 25.
"It's their image that's important," a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; these are the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inner qualities."
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city district management office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the demand for the order of the facial features.
That it means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Obviously, people with disabilities or disfigurement do not have to apply.
“We can’t let a lame person or a hump come here to serve,” Zheng said.
"It wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks bulging with a thinly curved mouth.
She does not consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked in a disappointed air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old co-worker at the pits, says, “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They are not opposed to limiting their mandate, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply chasing vendors into the alleys where they are supposed to limit their business.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many rolls or bowls of tofu as possible before taking the run.
"Master Wang, you must go."
"We've told you so many times!" said Ms. Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle bike.
Agents describe their functions as monotonous rather than arduous.
“It’s pretty much the same thing every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property of vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public exposures of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen Chengguan police officers and officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were shot down or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle screamed in scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, with their sinister faces, made their way to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, remained behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 and over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
“Sometimes we are fighting physically,” Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not indict Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case related to a former campaign assistant and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers said Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal around his case made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The honourable senator may still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case."
The Department of Justice abstained from commenting on the matter.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice that there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign allegedly conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to gain silence from Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a Treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; according to documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an employee of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole for a year.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be in contradiction to the so-called lobbying revolving door ban.
“There appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and materially violate the rotating door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign's case, Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecution after a number of high-level setbacks cashed out by its public integrity section, including Steven's decision last year to drop T's prosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the Director General of Citizens’ Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, senior lawyer for Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call Monday from a Justice Department prosecutor and follow-up the next day, telling him that the ministry was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutor.
“I’m not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice except to say that we think they’ve made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Mr. Ensign's payment of $96,000 by his parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "hammering" the Home Office on a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and he asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton in lobbying.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his fourth-ranking Republican leadership position in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
The Cheshire call will point to Twitter
A half-dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent horrific testimonial reports every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape case trial and the children tied to their bed in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the largely-followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family, in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines appeal arguments, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - has created a "circus atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could prompt appeal judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms violates human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Chief Counsel Hayes.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, laconically rejected the claims in last week’s ruling, claiming that the media were “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the issue.
Appeals courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his ruling that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage the media in courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
“There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media” in large-scale lawsuits, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue argues that some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes suffered harm when Justice Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical before prosecutors, and that he abusively put pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not abducted.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was being discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the post of governor and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media continued to ignite the flames of the emotion of the case.
“The daily scramble of tweets from the media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “was unlike anything that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the claim that the news snapshots were more incendiary than the releases delivered more slowly was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appeals courts were often attracted to arguments that social and technological changes required court adaptation.
Mr. Hayes’ lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling that overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction due to media coverage of the trial and they clarified that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring the divides closer together?
After a campaign marked by invectiveness and negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a warning sign of true bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the big issues that need to be addressed during the “lame duck” session.
But obviously, there was at least one polite discussion on the differences between the two sides as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
The public meeting of Wednesday’s committee on the president’s deficit was equally civilized, despite the political divergences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect transcending the ideological gap; but that, however, still divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of mutual trial and testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That's why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too great and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxation, spending, health care or fees, both sides are miles away.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed in the tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
“This is inevitable after the elections.
Elections provoke partisan passions and then they fade.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of it, permanently or temporarily.
Likewise, a compromise is envisaged on extending unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, more optimism is hovering over a possible agreement on issues raised during the session on the "lame duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the tea voters who contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee that include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, pushing the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the toughest tasks in Washington and, according to them, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected officials, suggesting that there are few grounds for or willingness to compromise on tax matters, at least today.
Galston predicts two phases in the fighting between the White House and Congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; then it will be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the reaction of the public.
The one who will be judged in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
However, that would be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked U.S. documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes to the Kremlin some of the bribes and protection money it collects, the U.S. embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then there have been few traces of clean-up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the corruption charges over the years; and he has won several defamatory trials on these charges.
In September, he told a Russian television channel, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s throwing, it’s anything.”
The Russians believe, with an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information set out in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and claim that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the embassy note.
The criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (a term used in the criminal/mafia world which literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report indicates that the FSB is brewing the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means, and more power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
“That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high.”
The note notes that although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business shut down under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly referred to the fight against corruption, but has admitted little progress.
The note from the embassy transmits reports of men bringing suitcases, probably full of money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said Georgi Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem think tank.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
“He is not part of a political class because there is none in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption would amount to more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least as most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US embassy note, which was only made yesterday late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks documents could be fabricated and reacted angrily to the words that U.S. diplomats had leaked by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect it would be accomplished with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics.”
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Face Past
In a poorly lit classroom with decaying, poor-quality concrete walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School evoked the man who built it, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves your mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared for his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, the longstanding loyalty to Anlong Veng is finally called into question.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled victims to face the people who had participated in the regime publicly.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, issued its first sentence against a former Khmer Rouge member, sentenced to 35 years in prison the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Yev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this evolution of the situation, anxiety increased among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body conducting research on the regime.
For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.
"The situation creates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the United Pol Pot government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla base in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the Khmer Rouge veterans have sunk into the black misery common to rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers kept their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down the weapons, they are unskilled farmers of low rank and record.
"These people have had very little follow-up after the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for our own needs.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge tribunal has also raised concerns here.
The court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Red minister, at the beginning of next year.
The court’s mandate is to try senior leaders and those responsible for the crimes, but it did not say whether it continued beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced labourers allegedly died.
Recently, on a hot evening, Im Chaem was returning from work to the field located near his wooden house on poles, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces," he said.
“We need to put these pieces together so we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history textbooks, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new handbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he said.
“They’re wary because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will sue.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual, and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful appeal here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads up to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a roof of rusted sheet metal.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old mobile phone seller on the roadside, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its military-grade uranium stockpile
The Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world.
The deal was leaked in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for a deal on Wednesday to remove the rest of the matter from about <0xC2><0xA3>500, according to a grievor who referred to the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The deal appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation nuclear security summit, held at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
“This proves to me that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the deal a "very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept high-enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“It’s our product ... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We’re going to use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus’ research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
“Miniculous coordination and organization has been put in place to build trust,” leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Energy Department specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Center, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable for the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
The government has not objected to CIA flights.
The government has not objected to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading for Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El País, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercise adequate vigilance on foreign planes passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting was held between former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "has surprised the Government of Zapatero out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
“De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence thefts over Spanish territory.”
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken by surprise," Aguirre says in a cable.
The incumbent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, informed the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence".
In January 2007, Attorney General Vicente González told the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (NIC) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating evidence, no sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown concern for "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than for declassified information from CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented to him that "even though the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a temperamentally flaming rhetoric".
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government,” she said.
The father who passed to confession complained in network of the "overwhelming" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two originating from Noia, the village of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a from which she originated.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, one must know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had begun a relationship in 1998 with industrialist Iván Tú<0xC3><0xB1>ez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, it was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his own, but his ex never let him get a DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elect was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labour market, the boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, we hear that their idyll has broken, they have separated.
In March 2008, she found herself in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset that I came to work there."
“When I told him it seemed like a good thing, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then she talks about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take him when I get home," she alleges.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'm only staying there until the 19th, because the 20th I have to show up at a workstation so I don't lose it".
She explains that if everything went well, she would have taken her eldest with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother," he said.
In July, there is another post.
When she hit him, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposed to have been murdered on the 10th, died.
"Caesar is pleased on one side, but he is not pleased on another."
"On one side he's with me and he likes this place a bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She talks about a trip to Majorca.
“He’ll go there a few hours in the summer and that’s how I’m saving a little bit of babysitter money.”
17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos on the email, you see, when he wants to, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, el goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me with money."
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of hers in the MySpace universe, now stuck, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Terror at the Galician (epigraph). "
The last man who lived with her, a vigilant, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything was over so she didn’t tell him the fact that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial prison in Palma yesterday from the Menorca Judicial Detainee Center.
The ex officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "and she also did not intend to harm the minor."
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and laying his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People’s Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation gets in these comices normally doubles that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans got 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomouss they had 316,222.
Last Sunday, the CPP won 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired by a diversion of the PSC votes and the loyalty of the PP electorate, the analysts of this formation calculated the fact that if there were general elections, the CPP could increase from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (he has now 10) and PSC would lose no more.
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - he has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would be held in May 2011 for the municipal comics, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and popularists agree that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fantasy that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lerida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes from PSC, of which the mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they met several times.
The populars also recorded progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand, there have been three
The seven Pakistani and the Nigerian detained by officers of the Barcelona Police Information General Commissariat formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba's last killing in 2008" (Let't)
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" has "been debilitated" Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and "therefore, its operational capacity".
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that were part of the criminal al-Qaeda galaxy so that its "fighters" could cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network held operative in Europe, that is why in the investigations participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days of coups similar to that recorded on the night of Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (we detained the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand we took another one, with the capture of the Butan Khuthar Pakistans.
They were the ones who led from Bangkok the cell implanted in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists the passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be on behalf of young men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found linking detainees in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency a few miles of dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used afterwards by the integrators of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized abundant documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday had the opportunity to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which is summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philosophical sovereignist adventures.
The president of the popular Catalans arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that will be exercised by the opposition abstain in the vote of the nomination.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an inauguration "all sovereignist and independenceist discourses should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to make thin the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the inauguration of Mas will be dealt with by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the harm caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the interim that he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the charge against the responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not detecting the night nurse's criminal activities in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - care he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only one indication of recklessness on the part of any other person than the accused."
The person already baptized as the "Angel of Death" confessed yesterday to 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused his death by injecting him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned that it is difficult to control the access of the centre's staff to medicines.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes the nurse, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But the lab tests will clarify whether Vila is lying by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having committed successfully eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to yesterday’s threat from Trichet that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral differentials have closed to force and the actions of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that, in the same way that it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and highly speculative position closures.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that current liquidity measures will be extended “at least until March” and that the quarterly unlimited-access auction will continue at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and that we will even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not fulfill the expectations generated, they will overthrow yesterday’s excellent market reaction and if they continue blinded to remove liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their meeting in May, where they claimed they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year milk auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only $500 million at 5.28% compared to $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, figures from the Allied Hole and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The estimated figures are 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a focal point of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relieve tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we are all interpreting the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish stock exchange suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it resolves with high demand and helps to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, triple compared to March, at very expensive types and they cut off access to the sine-die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar’s wife, “except to be, to appear.”
Courage, we can get away with it!
The president of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia asked by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers him "nul of law", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the holding company of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their litigation for control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company does not appear to be willing to cede in his dispute to be present in the executive bodies of El Enebro.
He was excluded from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the January 18 meeting of shareholders this year, whose challenge is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the thunderbox within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the plaintiffs his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly defrauding the Law and abusing the right, to validate and correct the official assembly radically null on January 18," according to his spokes.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly is held, to be contested considering that it is "void of law".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nonetheless solicits usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the challenge request for which there is not yet a stated date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
A software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one considered the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without decreasing the skill as a driver of the champion, German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that powers his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform him into a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far from high-end automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines from manufacturing plants around the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before constructing it in a real way, thus avoiding the defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 young, highly qualified professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens CEO explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull’s cars except the engine, which is Renault’s sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can move from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
“As the only limitation of this technological improvement madness there is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a town 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered a top secret.
The staff for this task has 580 people, including two pilots, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull Formula 1 hero, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drinks brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and zero notoriety.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says five years ago it could be said that R&D progress in racing cars brought about 50% of the wins and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while drivers contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP to set up 20 clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the redesigned store located on Gran Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to establish 200 brand sales outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first opens were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems has ensured that the philosophy for the establishment of the stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of exclusive store furniture (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will maintain an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institution staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses aims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, support, post-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering global pilot program that solves the potential issues of HP’s warranty IT equipment.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as the major companies have already contracted technical support services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' a million customers to rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liabilities war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse of interest margins, which will be attempted to partially offset by increments of commissions and credit prices.
In three years, Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers, its task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011, the bank will launch a new master plan that will maintain a three-year sustainability.
The goal, apart from surviving without recourse to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market rating by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank - its great task to be accomplished, because so far this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the private customer.
This year it attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the betting on productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, because the financial crisis has disturbed all plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima master plan, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more year.
Customers who leave the savings banks out will be its main objective.
During a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 will be a “difficult and transcendental” year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create workstations", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war of the liabilities - which penalizes margins - is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and cashiers pay for its issues to obtain liquidity is already moving at the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a factor of credit pressure."
“We didn’t tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of spreads - see CincoDías on November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "there will be asked for larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He says that capital needs are "increasing tremendously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporal closing of markets, he diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He pointed out that it is not possible to issue, but contrary to what happened in June, it is possible to obtain short-term financing through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the funds
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the Spanish savings banks merger process began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been carried out, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of it has been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," he said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out in the deadlines that have been set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", emphasized.
"The move from 45 cash registers with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an unmatched trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be compliant with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a fairly unhappy series of opinions on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and he attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who doubt it.
The leader said that given the current economic situation, “we can stay very quiet” with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a “very important” concentration process and “goes at the highest possible speed”.
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector did well with the stress tests that BCE carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin chose to stay in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have provoked a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolishment of the 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of the 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins Chancellor Angela Merkel’s criticism of her responsibility for detaching the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another constraint on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal rigor, fines to the countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for apologies.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought needed to be done (fiscal rigour plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on, it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel once again expresses a clear position, calling for reform of the Union treaties to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little sweetened, was approved and, in the months that follow, we should be witnessing the process of reforming the Union that makes these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date onwards the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be forced to declare themselves in default of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a part of the costs.
Germany signals to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not just about bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked for is much harder.
And what he absolutely should not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring greater tranquility to us.
And let us know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, the thesis has been paved the way for ordering at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don’t seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are being considered, one cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone too full of unreasonable countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the willingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League drew a lot of ink on the unsportsmanship of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team was already clearly winning), both players deliberately lost their time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of his group, both players will meet the regulatory penalty during the next game of the dam game against Auxerre and will be able to move without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Discipline Committee sanctioned team coach José Mourinho with two games and various financial sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the related case is due to the fact that this had as the protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his anthem displays nobility and honor and who in past occasions sentenced his players to a fine for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, which adds a more episode to his story.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation in contradiction to the principles of sport, that is, if these actions are committed to fraud by law; because, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sporting regulations, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sporting mind.
One of the assets that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been endangered, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another asset that is alluded to with correct play is to prevent the infringing team from unfairly benefiting the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not conform to what is normally described as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in hiding to try to avoid the penalty, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty from the referee.
They waited and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders get from the intentional misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put the opponent in a disadvantage situation and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action involves leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty game and move to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with a less than in the first cycle.
So, climbing the steps is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not at odds with the spirit of sport, which is still part of making strategic decisions that promote profit to the maximum of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), but they chose instead the time when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without overcoming the penalty or running away from it.
Even though the boundary between genius and law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way to transmit the director to provoke them.
The evil caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCB
The calendar dictatorship concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December arrives, also return the group dinners before Christmas which continue to be the oxygen ball for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive te prices adjusted to be able to capture the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, and the men's association coincide.
To complete the accounting, this year’s calendar (as New Year’s Eve falls Friday) concentrated demands in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying from their own pockets.
Whatever the situation is, they are all demanding battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict what the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices,” he said.
The deal will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to descend a step down with the crisis, so the slice around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey of various facilities in the center found the collapse of applications for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic demand boom for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economy, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locations, remains optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends celebrating the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased a little.
On the part of the employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall the reservations are "animated", even if the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
This is true, the hope regarding the festivities has not declined, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at a “faster rate than any other country.”
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy of Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns raised by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "decreasing" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main concerns in Washington.
For example, the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the Taliban-attacked territory, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is high, and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain guard.
“Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given declining educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs,” Yuri Korolev, a Russian foreign ministry expert, said during a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through the Julian Assange portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan’s high degree of nuclear weapons production.
A May embassy dispatch, which described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", said: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of aid remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, said that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end its tacit support for terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks leader
Obama will number a senior anti-terrorism official to prevent further infiltration.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and track Assange’s movements.”
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, this one is not new, otherwise it is dated November 20.
And this has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian is facing in Sweden.
Wikileaks' founding lawyer Mark Stephens said: "The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
The 20th the international police force headquartered in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol were instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the order to arrest an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the call red notice a free way for arrest -- which the national police corps must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden's and England's.
The movement has angered Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday released a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has been willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via video conferencing.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
“This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he granted an indeterminate interview to Time magazine's director via Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to U.S. graduates to spy on the UN in violation of the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request “ridiculous and absurd.”
"I'm not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior anti-terrorism official, Russell Travers, with preventing further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s essay to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides contributions or assistance.”
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to revert to his statements after saying that Assange should be "murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something like that."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever is in the government who has leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to Carod followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the yet-next internal revolt inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the supporters of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot at all give him headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 ERC national advisors will be able to rule on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the Carodians want to convey a certain vote of penalization to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "in Bulgarian" would not be good either.
The people close to Carod demand a little more from the president than to make his position available to the militancy, a gesture that is not worthwhile when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the National Council for a vote on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a certain fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash its laundry room with the family.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he highlights two.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is to say, to include new figures that come from the followers sector of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC once and for all the assembly as an operating mechanism.
Thus, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of the congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave upheaval mandated management to revise the assembly model at a specific congress reforming the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time might be right to take it back and shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Between the murders are these three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases, mention is made of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the grace shot to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the corpse of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the luggage compartment of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan municipality.
Early Thursday morning, the owners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Near the body, we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he was leaving his house to initiate the garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a shot at the head each in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the grace shot in the forehead we found the body of a man on a lonely path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet struck with a 25 caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the colony Plaza Golondrina.
The emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán have warned of the discovery of a corpse that was in Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada, with hands tied behind and eyes bandaged.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot in the neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and left in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony we found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan was located who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, in agreement with a message that his executioners had left to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman, tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image were detected.
Around the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet strikes and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads wrapped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him, agents found a bust with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, China’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and pilot programme support.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the targets for greenhouse gas reduction, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for changing incandescent lamps with cost-effective lamps, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific advisor to the country’s government on climate change, assured that China’s efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tonnes per person, while in the United States they are 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar one by 2020, he said.
Espino's legal expulsion: César Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission to claim what is lawful.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former panist leader has the right to appeal to the Commission d’Ordre National to demand what law.
In the interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission d'Ordre de Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission d'Ordre of the National Council, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he enlightened that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance for the presidential candidacy on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of December 4 and 5, where a successor should be elected.
"This [an alliance in 2012] is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for now, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal," he said.
The panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary "we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council will probably be able to elect the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the succession "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five."
He predicted that the revival recorded by the party in the last election of July 4 will be reflected on the next dispute, although "this is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"At the moment it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that there has been "a lot of hope in regards to them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the prisoners to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; let them start defending them; let them come out of the cabinet,” he said.
He said that the incumbent of the federal executive can make expressions like those he did in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, let alone censorship.
Obama promotes law on Twitter for undocumented students
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama met today at national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
Its short message keeps open a cybernetic link with a broader document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote that we hope will soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,” he said.
The message was leaked after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were extended.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agenda can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
“We all agree that this tax problem needs to be resolved before the end of the year.”
“I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a “debate closing vote” for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, even though the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they stayed in that country for the last five years, and they were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the assistance of a large number of Republicans, at times when the protagonists of the project’s partisan organizations intense lobbying to ensure the passage of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's term of office.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, from Texas, but they said they were not going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature you put your finger on the wound
The second stage of the Language Pleasures was a walk in which participants showed the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... finger on the wound? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of Language Pleasures, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of his question.
The finger on the wound "... puts us in embarrassment", gently threw the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only leads in the same narrative thread.
From the infectious doctor she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who took his breath away in the middle of the hallway, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be closely linked to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a lovely narrative that he called Praise for Invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at some point is discovered.
With hints of magical realism, he speaks of a famous sorcerer who touched clouds, returned people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turns to talk then America, the great news that had from the beginning his own columnists and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the narratives of excesses.
Cervantes who invented us all (writers) made fun of the false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in some way one would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked modesty.
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "fools and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lying, we no longer know what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is called the Cervantes tradition.
“It is through his legacy that we are what we tell.”
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with his round table Le due on the wound.
The Cuban-Portoricana has put her on the great plague of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes from trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not, of course, premeditated," she said, citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ends with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it owes on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times to put your finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturb the powers who prefer a world in white and black," he said.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast between them marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series three times, even though so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine ended up comforting himself with the sub-champion medal, he stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santiste strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Fence he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Ray.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got a 3-1 advantage with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed the result by 11 meters and he suffered the result of his 4 missed.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," he said when asked what would be his weaknesses in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the final, of which he asserts that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run, and I think that's the lesson.
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players situation: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety to hold our hands between us.
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing visas at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to submit to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (Visa Applicant Service Centres, ASC) prior to their interview at the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages for applicants, including the following:
The total cost for processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Individuals wishing to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves to the nearest ASC where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency has quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will release tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
There seems to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, living in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of living and this ability makes us think that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries in the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest satellite), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germ PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'block' opposing
With reforms to the Congressional Organic Law, the arrival of 'bipartisanship' is made possible, it is denounced.
The 60th century had just settled when an opposition bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo appeared in Congress, which declared itself independent and all four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the Houses.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, de PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, de PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, were 'tonning' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we are initiating ‘bipartisanism’ because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four MPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that over the next few days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme on the basis of political will and if they do not have it, they will again be enslaved by both parties and in this way will end the opposition coalition.
“So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that’s what I look at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipartisanship in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more, the Convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now the Congress has transformed into a 'loot' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the member's personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they don't leave by cupular agreements out to 5 who will probably be 9 MPs, now of the five that we see, separated into different fractions, we have decided to come together to look for a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided, we are out and we disagree with this reform."
$200 million more for the "supplier"
The City Hall of Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount that was paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 mil 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of supplier account".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Higher Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“We didn’t buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the latter on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the State Official Journal, according to the Act's predictions when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Noroeste had published a review of the cheques that the City Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, collecting cheques worth more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be cared for
The tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into a hollow of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the Mazatlán tourism sector has asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a poor image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Trade Association of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be neat and new activities should replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
“Politics don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune you lose, elsewhere they didn’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and only make the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area we must maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention that is needed and this type of fact emphasizes something that is notorious to all, the interview is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of Mazatlán’s tourist sites is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that need to be in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
“Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination.”
IP asks for results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
The business sector of Mazatlán is seeking a dignified and free working legislature of agreements between the parties and the government executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term was set up, consisting of seven political forces, 19 deputies from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that MPs really exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because the custom is that they make pacts to guard their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I call for them to certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do a dignified and above all committed job with society and the sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Tres Islas Hotels, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate stimulus for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Governmental Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that this is the second Secretariat of State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that rivals directly with the agro-industry."
Aside from the fact that it is necessary to classify resources to tourism projects that are detonators that help to give security to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We are looking for King Mage.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is made up of no more or less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear them the toys and clothes they want so much.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' for sale on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a monster truck and for his 8-month-old little brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests waistwear for a year.
“He told me (José Alfredo), ‘I’d like to have this monster,’ but I told him, ‘We’ll see, my son,’ because he was very dear,” Cayetana recalls with sadness.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, wears size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, wears size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of the size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, giving a toy or money at the reception of Noroeste.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie, Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The raids took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places allegedly used for drug production.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession with the aim of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place as a result of a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is information received from the public that allowed us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Estrie de la S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec regional investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Regie took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives bill, which the government says should address the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, is obviously going to be beaten as the three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
“I stand with a party that created granite under your feet,” Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The Liberals argue that the proposed bill, which would detain anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he is targeting the wrong target.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do,” Duceppe said.
The NDP’s immigration critic, Olivia Chow, rejected backhand criticism that her party was not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that's what we're doing through another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are massively telling MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a dugout."
"They expect Canada to take strong action," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on his bill, which could have led the country to elections in the event of his rejection.
A Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every member who opposes it would then explain himself to his voters.
The new unity is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this issue as early as January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services of Quebec, on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
No more was needed for the pecist critic of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this ad “a rabbit out of a hat” and “a solution crafted on the corner of a table”.
Minister Dutil responded to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on possible future unity.
“You’ll see the result when we announce it,” he says.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, nothing can replace a public inquiry.
“The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General,” he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing it to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government's boxes.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews has confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some of the amendments related to this matter.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit groups of bikers, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangster Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, ranging from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain was expected by Thursday night, depending on the region.
Areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some sectors, there is a fear of overflowing several streams.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday night by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, at Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was carried away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes resulted in the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civilian security remains on the alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued warnings on Wednesday of heavy floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Council for Standards of Television (CCNR) for controversial remarks on social assistance and Haitians as well as on his rough on-air language.
The CCNR finds that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some comments contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and gross language that is not suitable for broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two individuals who committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CNRC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of Social Assisted Persons of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
Facilitators must provide sound information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, host Stéphane Dupont had felt that suicide was a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont le noud" have addressed a sensitive topic in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame was therefore held in his place.
The last litigation concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then given themselves to a face-to-face media that had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI host said he had made no donations to help Haitians because it was not possible to know for sure that people in need would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
“I’ve already served my three-day suspension on that.”
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of gross language.
In each case, broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during high-speed hours within three days.
King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008, said.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the man who works as a security officer and as a clerk for the UPS company delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories," he said.
“At the moment, I’m preparing to go to China for the San Shu World Cup.”
"The fighters who finished in the top four in the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished fifth in the tournament, while I came third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've progressed in every competition."
“At this pace, I’ll be the first this time or next year!”
San Shu or Sanda is a discipline native to China where punching and kicking, as well as projecting to the ground, are allowed.
Duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned boxer from this form of combat is the Vietnamese-born American Cung Le, well-recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to remember in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the "King of Sanda" super tournament, the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the most elevated and prestigious in China," explained the friendly gaillard.
"It's kind of the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro," he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face off to crown only one champion, the kung fu king."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has awarded over-the-counter $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that has obtained the largest, that of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without a tender.
This consortium called Managed Energy was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Managed Consortium was awarded the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing prices to rise.
"That's the new way to collusion and knock down the competition."
“In other words, people, instead of doing it secretly, are now doing it openly,” said Sylvain Simard, a member of parliament for the Pécs, at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he hardly saw how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
“I’m starting to have my trip,” she said, arguing that the PQ had been “dishonest” and “lacked rigour.”
She said that "it would be the least thing" that the PQ apologizes for.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the magnitude of the work.
The project is underway and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition acting; there was negotiation.
Therefore, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week in Le Devoir, the consulting engineering consortium formula is being investigated by the government.
A quick survey of the Quebec business register allows to count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, or Dessau.
Regarding the Energy Managed Consortium, Minister Normandeau pointed out that "the James Bay territory responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s".
The great Eastmain project boss, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made it blunt that the project's stewardship contract was granted on an over-the-counter basis.
"If you go to the tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and at a good price."
“But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the competence of the people,” Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Génivar has 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in Energy Managed.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Managing Energy contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Quebec Liberal Party".
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to those firms that "finance" it, before clarifying that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also fair brands and greening certifications to guide their choices.
Even if he bathes in a media universe where the messages in favor of more responsible consumption are crowded, he deplores a lack of credible information, a lack that he even calls a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications affixed to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands showing themselves as eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the discourse of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this part of consumption currently driven by almost a third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and doubtful nature of information would calm the ardours of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of the alleged performance of the green products or services they are trying to get into their hands.
On another note, nearly half of consumers in 2010 changed their habits and, most importantly, changed brands of one or more products to meet their conviction.
As much as 61%, they also favored purchases from traders in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible – the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year – the Homo consumus du Québec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by caring for the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers reported using public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioral survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A state loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to engage financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex by Société Angus et le Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but with a loan only.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving it back its full cinematic vocation, did not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would be lower than original expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least according to the opinion of sources from the State offices.
A first action plan and a $12.8 million request had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the cabinet arrived at the SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the state's donation really needs to be dismissed.
Recall that the Association des propriétaires de cinemas et de cineparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several stakeholders were demanding substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of Céans, for ten years carried the author's cinema in his premises of the complex after having financed its construction himself, which could justify a waiver on the part of the Treasury Council.
The lack of theaters for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The Angus Company and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallele, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27th by screening the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the U.S. considers the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but they also betray the Americans’ sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are amazed that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-U.S. relations in mind when they go to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government get its budget passed in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread on the public square yesterday, offer more crispy details than substantial content to be put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of the federal election campaign, reports how the United States is not one of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“A nearly inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday internal issues rather than making this election go over the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less because the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance can be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, chief business officer in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the federal budget confidence vote in early February, where Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30-40 billion recovery plan," Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to prolong Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast on CBC sends back from the United States.
The ambassador is worried about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O broadcasts, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or kidnappings for muscular CIA interrogations.
Another cable reports that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it was written, "he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let’s note that the minds are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC airwaves that the person responsible for the massive leak should be "murdered."
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
The United Nations yesterday in Cancún proposed a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that corresponds to nearly one-third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent light bulbs or, better, light-emitting diode bulbs (DEL or "LED"), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That’s the equivalent of 70% of the global car fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance sheet another 5 Gt to manage to stabilize by 2020 the rise of the climate to 2 degrees Celsius in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With compact light bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this need for energy is reduced by twice as much.
Compact light bulbs last on average from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have posted reservations about compact fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and they must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the compact fluorescent light bulb, but rather coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire is nervously waiting for election results to be announced
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire “without delay” after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to be accountable and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from foreign governments, the electoral commission missed Wednesday’s midnight deadline without publishing the results, three days after Sunday’s election.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CIS had told television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
Calls have multiplied around the world on Wednesday for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp counts on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters practised by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe the country's highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any connection with the former rebels, said the delay in announcing the results was "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the election commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained split in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% by counting the overseas departments), show the provisional seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published Thursday by the INSEE.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in the metropolis.
The second quarter data were confirmed to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, rising to 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over a year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 youth aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors, for their part, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 points over three months as well as over a year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or older, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only 25-49-year-olds benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 points over three months, +0.1 points over a year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The INSEE has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne General Council, was indicted and nutted at the Luynes detention centre near Aix-en-Provence in an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been indicted for abuse of social property, misappropriation of public funds and property, custody, active corruption, smuggling of influence and possession of ammunition, his lawyer says.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It's easy to prosecute him for a multitude of wrongful charges, it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had to, through his lawyers, pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged Wednesday evening and nutted.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never knew about it, said Mr Simon.
In the case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was indicted Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial scrutiny with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts he is accused of."
“The instructing magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty,” his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, said.
Four other people were indicted and released in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for “smuggling with influence and passive corruption”.
Two officials of the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted one for "subtraction and misappropriation of public goods by a person entrusted with a public service mission", the other for "compliance with the misappropriation of public funds".
Finally, the companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was indicted for "retention of abuse of social property".
Among the people who faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently stuck in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of having served to launder money from the great banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
Source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill of La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée exaggerated Syria mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", has kept the opinion in France on hold, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some underpinning of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on dealing with their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not been in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the US court for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put in a blunt light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it wasn't.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The Elysée’s advisor for strategic affairs, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meets with U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly detained nationals to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continuously hammer" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", " innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it.”
Because, after attempts to talk through discreet channels, “the silence will not settle anything,” the Iranians are “masters in delaying maneuvers.”
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was “a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss' prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros in bail).
And he says that the Elysée is anticipating other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains stuck in Iran.
Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. demands extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The American embassy, like many observers, is questioning this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which is chasing Iran's clandestine nuclear procurement networks, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against the liberation of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he said, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There was a lively exchange between the French presidency and the guardian of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot revert to the judicial decision", he observes.
Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of the French intelligence services.
The Elysee adviser dials a phone number, hangs up and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is not spared its efforts, through press releases and "leaks" organized in the media, to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation bears fruit since several news articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the media flash of the French officials".
The embassy in Paris asks why so much “gratitude” is expressed to Assad.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then looks at the reasons that led the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008 that “had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unmerited”.
By exaggerating the Syrian role, Paris seeks to “show Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “saai seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
“But we thanked them anyway.”
“This should at least cause confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called “Cinderella” law that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16, representatives of the ministries of culture and family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the ministerial official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who demand it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to heavy use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA appoints host countries
In turmoil over suspicions of corruption, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk taking precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is for sure, the 2018 edition of the FIFA queen competition will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continuing its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities from the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measurement of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations are likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the English, Hispanic-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations that resulted in the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the chances of his country, cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC handed over a layer on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This is enough to displease FIFA and embarrass British officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to republish the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the London Olympics in 2005.
Will this intense activity suffice to revive England's coat of arms with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal is no shortage of assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial outlook of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the creditworthiness of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite the gaps in its file (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled reference to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experiment, appears as the logical favorites.
As the world’s leading economic powerhouse, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new nominations appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would in fact obliterate the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which has released the big game by proposing futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from low TV fees paid (due to the time lag) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second Mandate: Evidence
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One mandate to the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not balance well with the mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then we have to pretend that doubt still exists.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a grave air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
That he talks to parliamentarians UMP, Tuesday evening at the Elysée, the prospect of "two terms" has therefore sown a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far from it.
The president only recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-years to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has spoken about the presidential election, in the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His remarks yesterday make him no more candidate than the day before; they make him no less.
If there is any comment, there is a dual reason.
The acceleration of the race for candidates for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry of Ségolène Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
This is on the contrary because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are calling for an earlier than expected order of battle.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
“We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this,” the Prime Minister’s entourage responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned obviously.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was expected to be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the termination of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations that are due to end at the end of the year.
As the European sovereign debt crisis obliges, the Frankfurt issuing institution will no doubt not be able to afford to be as peremptory or worsen a more tense situation on the European bond markets today.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, praised the active role played by the ECB in resolving the debt crisis of states in Europe.
It did not want to say whether it felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...)".
The day before, in Brussels, at his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more dissatisfaction about his intentions, merely indicating that the program for buying state securities on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main governing rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of Treasuries doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystem have bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that there is an expectation of continued procurement (see page 29).
Neither do economists expect a significant change in course.
While lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited cash allocations on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this system to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that it's changing its program in a significant way."
“Otherwise it would be risking further tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds to stimulate a sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European bank exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a packing of returns paid by the most fragile states," said a senior bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates fly up, States will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government backs off
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a bit, yesterday, with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then denied.
On Tuesday, the gap with German long rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy-risk hedging contracts (CDS) had swung to 263 points, leading to some panic in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was greater than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In short, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax revenues that goes with it, causing the state to run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels’ latest forecast has been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
“The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, Italy’s IMF administrator for Italy.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short or long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011), the stabilization efforts demanded from Italy are less than those demanded from other countries," observes OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan.
The question of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the House of Representatives, after which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up a period which would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde again hammered it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe we have demonstrated it again on Sunday in the day and at night, are obviously solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, yesterday’s slowdown in European government bond rates brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we can’t talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted by speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs on banking systems in particular," said the economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform far-eastern investors of developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground for them.
The first issue of EFSF securities is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The front-line countries Portugal and Spain, meanwhile, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to closer-effect austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both sides want at all costs to avoid seeking international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalizing sovereign bond markets.
In Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber first advanced the idea that if the €750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of about 100 billion euros would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with, to date, 60 billion euros.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in vigilance orange
The snowy episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and risk disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienne, have been added to the 20 departments already in vigilance orange, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows lightly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowy episodes are sufficiently noticeable to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, several departments have been banned for heavy vehicles over 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend to take his vehicle only in case of need and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged Wednesday night to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture “invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly.”
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights on Paris’ Roissy airport and 10% in Orly due to upcoming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the time that the debate about the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, the billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, we mention 23 billion for the metro Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the state announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The amending Finance Act 2010, discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements planned to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, it reads in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is numbered: "The proceeds of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're a long way from the 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment that will be mobilized by the State and provided to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," reads the statement of reasons.
At SGP, we don't find this system shocking.
"From the moment you create revenues (both taxes), you can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion afterwards," it explains.
"It will be included in the budget and pulled as it goes."
The SGP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be enrolled in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion promised are still to the absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat turbulent parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avengers and spies in due diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file made up by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what could have been read in any newspaper for months (except those owned by Berlusconi), and Gaddafi's sinisterly caricatured profile has long been for sketch-material cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats exactly what was already written in earlier works (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rose Cross).
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (or knows where to look for news on the inexperienced), but because those who engage in occultism only believe in what they already know, and that reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
Same for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, what do I know, editor at Liberation), who retains as true only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into espionage centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, publicly repeating it violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secretive secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put the victims as much in crisis as the "boars".
But let’s get to the deep nature of what happened.
In the days of Orwell, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely proven since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the avenger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is true, too, that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power from her.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but has made it too big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to post any reserved information online - this would be like publishing it on a poster glued around the corner.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is vain to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know well that, for now, my forecast is science fiction and therefore novel, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligences to uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned from the heart or, at most, by hiding the rare information written in the heart.
The information will be kept as a single copy in locked drawers: at bottom, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet re-established a wire telegraph (telephone).
The videotapes (analogue) had allowed the film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the editing, while now the CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the travels that it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques are used for horse-drawn cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secrets of the embassies.
Now, it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: How France is hacking its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review the fulfilment of the pledges of fast-start or early financing made by developed countries.
And the big French scams are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU put out the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the actions of its member states, press conference, big side event, distribution of brochures...
The Transparency operation is appreciable and appreciated at its best: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", to ensure that additional effort is made without being to the detriment of Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonization, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as the reference year: international financing is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years under fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of the year 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditures in previous years or to the overall level of Public Development Assistance.
Concretely, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment in terms of “new and additional” financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses his or her own way of calculating.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ loaned equals 1€ given.
Obviously, this is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to emissions mitigation that are based on more efficient technologies), it is wrong to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At most, should be counted against its commitments only the cost of the loan for the lending country (i.e. the equivalent).
But France has to make such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (in other countries) meet their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts €1 to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass-through tour!
In short, in its fast-start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to make it seem that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in accordance with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to give if it was enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely duped...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to all climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (former Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have statistically significant value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem addressed," between July and September, the foods generally consumed in four meals and a snack in a day by a child about ten years old, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including official recommendations – five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – as well as treats, were reviewed by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The record is overwhelming: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five are classified as certain carcinogens as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear from our survey that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is of concern," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven to be certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even bread wand and chewing gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the richest with 34 chemical residues detected and even examining the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this "cocktails of contaminants" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
