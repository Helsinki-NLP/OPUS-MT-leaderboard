28-year-old cook found dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall.
The victim’s brother said he can’t imagine anyone who would harm him, “Finally he went uphill again.”
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco forensic department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as a murder and the investigation was ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had gotten his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A Son & Daughter spokesman said they were "shocked and devastated by his death."
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank’s family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who wanted to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook something for us, to prepare dinner for us,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of argument.
He was the brother who swam with the river.
“In everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that glows brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the SFPD’s notice phone at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always put in drawers or get labels glued on from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
“I don’t want to always be perfect and successful.”
"Honestly, I'm more likely to be sniffing these things."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of television with loose dutt and Mexican food, the magazine says.
“We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” the Hollywood star said.
In her new movie "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's play" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will take place with us from August 25.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are easy to manage.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of change with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their cessation, chasing home to the feed troughs in a quick gallop.
A mile at that speed, I was scared.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer said.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.
He let his family guide him over the ALRV system, on a horse he did not even swing for photographic purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed the man from Anhausen the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lauberblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British queen has adored him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen he met first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting successes, but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring.
And so he also handed over the prize money of 25,000 euros immediately.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the double U.S. Masters winner was admitted to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
The winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the turner Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Erhard Wunderlich der Postemöhle
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the big animals.
Clinton’s and Trump’s Economic Policy Comparison: It’s All About the Money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - both Clinton and Trump want it.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental question.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, Trump claims.
He will push back on regulations massively, and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has opportunities for disadvantaged people and it needs money to do so.
That’s why taxes would be raised for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say they need to be invested in it almost in the same way.
The Democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classically democratic policies and are strictly rejected, for example, by the Republican’s state-critical Tea Party wing.
So there could be in-depth discussions on Trump.
More clearly are the differences in energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the United States.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with her investment program, calling for: “One country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.”
“It will probably be either China, Germany or America – I want us to be.”
However, not only in terms of infrastructure – even in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.
They should be paid better, Clinton said.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says that the minimum wage must go up, then he says that it should not be changed.
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics argue that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand that the rich pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: 'Every refugee woman has experience of sexual violence'
Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
In a large kitchen there are four women.
Everyone has a baby who is at most one year old.
One of them put her little son in the arms.
He looks curiously into the room with large eyes.
His mother stares at the table.
Until she realizes she is being watched.
She smiles and kisses the little boy.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the divisional managing director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and is involved in the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Aid.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
“It’s no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her flight,” Bahr says.
“Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as bearers of hope,” she says.
In women, other reasons for fleeing prevail: "Many steal from it secretly because they see no other way out."
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriage, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her away.
On the run, it goes on.
“That tractors, for example, demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not uncommon,” Bahr says.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever believes that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany is crazy, Bahr says.
Again, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused at worst.
This means that about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
“Some of the children were not born voluntarily.
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great."
Because they often don’t know how to help, they need more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for hosting refugees.
On the question of whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their area of competence, some answer with no.
In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodations.
Even in Schwaben, refugees alone are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are some community accommodations for single women and their children only.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says, “It is very important that men and women are housed separately.”
“If privacy is lacking or men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can occur – on an ongoing basis.”
Above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, says the study.
How much women feel this need for protection can be seen from the urge that exists on the house in Munich.
“Since it’s been saying that we exist, we have a long waiting list,” Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Assisting doctors strike: demands for new labour measures
Deputies of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labour measures in their disputes over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more labour action from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that ministers had failed to address concerns about the treaty.
In July, assistant doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted Thursday evening on Twitter, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “persistently calm” about problems, leading to the contract being rejected.
“In light of this, the JDC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and requested official re-negotiations on all your concerns.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour action beginning in early September.
The disputes resulted in assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was advantageous and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an “alliance of outsiders”?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile was slimy and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report about five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis level, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan behaving as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to indicate the opposite.
But a lasting coolness radiating from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting down of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin said Ankara had fallen in the back of Russia.
The offense was even greater, as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding your trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia had some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has declined by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
You count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, state television forecasted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists along there, tomatoes along here."
But the visit had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West as it sees its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
In addition, there is continued resentment over the snail speed of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state in Ankara certainly won a bonus for calling for support for the elected organs after the attempted coup.
This is, of course, a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid seaside palace enabled Russia and Turkey to represent, as an analyst once described it to me, an “alliance of outsiders”: two countries that feel repelled by the West and treated badly and are now allying themselves.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the press conference that they had not even stripped the issue.
The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator on Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a backoffice role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since when it nearly collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to put more national brands in the spotlight.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller retail brands that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we become more of a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to develop into the Bank of Brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of change.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches his 3,000th win at Newmarket at Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne for a double at Newmarket that will earn him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He bet on Predilection, coached by John Gosden, a milestone on his local track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori picks up the cheer when he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been intriguing fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already gotten 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been a winner for nearly 30 years in the UK, which is great.
He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but besides that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Sevens" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from his six-month lockdown, but he showed impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until he is at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest circle of trust.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In a Kremlin statement, Putin said, without stating reasons, “ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration.”
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin’s website, it is said (in Russian) that he was later protocol chief and chief of staff of government personnel.
On his appointment, he said to Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that he had asked Ivanov to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This move has made Moscow shrouded in mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants for a long time and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows this right now.
But the official claim — that a man once touted as a potential president would suddenly want to lead Russian environmental policy — ran into great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said “it’s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post – you could almost say – cumbersome post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that after Putin’s second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.
But this post was taken over by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical clash on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized Thursday before the announcement of his termination.
There were artistic differences and disagreements on the set.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson’s character will be written out from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been there since the series' first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have been putting all my heart into it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mysteries about fish landing in Banff Garden
A resident of Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals spewed from a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct – meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "ceiling blower" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slanted ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economics Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering of truly epic dimensions on this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking construction and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of road deck and its connection with the north tower deck under development, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern supply bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.
Delicate, since the tolerances the team was working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have “happiness to be still alive”
Three men have “happiness to be still alive” after being thrown off Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI Rescue Station sounded alarm on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim safely as their boat moved on by their own power.
“We saw the boat turn around near her and imagined the worst,” said Moelfre rescue station manager Vince Jones.
“Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we let it go to water,” he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have been lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stopper, it detached itself from the person who steered the boat when the boat was tied.
Someone watched over these men today.
Hardly injured - man punches on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
According to police yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came to the apartment, he struck her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She alarmed her sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
She couldn’t get him out of the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her partner.
On the street, they met the man’s ex-company.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be taken into account much more in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 cheap homes in the next few years?
The SPD proposes for the next meeting of the Council a "Handling Concept of Living".
Dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
A regulation is lacking so far.
SPD group chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban land, in the future 20 percent of all apartments must be classified as social housing."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock.
Bratmann said, “How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?”
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent of the housing on such land, but as much as possible 20 percent of the housing as social housing."
A new urban housing funding program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the factions."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The Left wants tough conditions for investors.
Nevertheless, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is on the verge of worsening.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear if we will get the specialists.
But the program is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes.
To prevent this, according to the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring ties should now be purchased by the city.
In addition, it would be necessary to think about bringing homes back into price binding.
This is possible in the West City.
At one stroke, the problem could be solved.
Because in the western city deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back there in the price binding for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners do not want it, the housing companies do not.
If the number of social housing units in the western city increases again drastically, one moves away from the goal of so-called intermixing.
A concentration of socially weak people in only a few districts should no longer exist.
The Greens expect that there will be further movement in the debate.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke said: "For a broad majority, the CDU must join the boat."
It has concentrated on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But that doesn’t mean that a compromise can’t be reached.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
It’s fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest fell somewhat before the game was released in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Market launch in other countries was delayed by massive demand overloading the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on their phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was still younger joined the insanity and jumped off the sofa for the search.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the “average” person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people tracked who exercised for 30 minutes every day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want to get people to “take 30 minutes,” “come out of the sofa” and “be active every day” came across deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are also grumpy game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What are you doing?
There has been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity before, they didn’t give us any reason to do sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will slow down over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's tournaments
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Easily on the beam.
Stunning on the floor.
Overall brilliant.
And now finally an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-fight title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles turns on the floating beam during the women's singles multi-match final in the art tournament at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fight title and the fifth overall as she consolidates her reputation of being the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end in that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport over the past three years, winning 15 world champion medals — including 10 gold medals — with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is “the best gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
They expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women's single multi-turnering finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while it served as an exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of retiring team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during her long journey to the top, that’s not really true.
Part of their ground exercises – which include their typical Tumbling Pass – are tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a multi-fight competition since summer 2013, a winning series that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led lightly through two turns, the image deceived.
Floating beams and ground towers - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurched.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and with a 15,933 on the ground she put one more on it.
Raisman gently embraced her as they awaited her finale - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Bile's shiny red, white and blue eyeliners as the vision she once described in her book became reality.
Raisman’s performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called “Grandma” by the Americans, had a head start.
After her ground exercise, she threw kissing hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 serial killers killed while listening to music in car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix’s first serial killing incident while chatting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in an entrance, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, according to the report.
Police reported that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 owned by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to get a closer look at whether it was associated with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks, predominantly in Hispanic residential areas within four months.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of a house,” Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the serial killer’s work.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'It's getting better'
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like few of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't get involved in that.
Which isn’t true at all – of course they got involved,” she said.
Her husband Vincent and she were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
“My first answer to that was ‘I didn’t know people were still doing it,’” Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund couldn’t sit or crawl until he was 3 years old and he still can’t speak.
But he's slowly making progress.
He can walk with support and cycling.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund conceived for "Please sing something to me."
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what would happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the forecast in a long time because I don’t expect it to really tell me.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rains expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance to affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said the Tangipahoa community alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed over large parts of southern Louisiana by Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, a flood warning system was deployed on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will most likely reach record levels over the weekend.
Metreologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas over the trampled rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest record level on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue teams still plucked people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts of southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
“We woke up and the water flowed in,” Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high point of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency responders rescued all three in a large military truck and took them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "spreaded quickly" as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inch rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil has been significantly enriched by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school dropouts in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated into two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
Robby Miller said authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed in by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuees.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa municipality, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents who hoped to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," Lacy Landrum of the city said.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County emergency manager Rupert Lacy said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and it’s still coming.”
Mahaj Brown, 6, "pierced by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time a 6-year-old has been shot.
The boy’s grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the lumbar, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was punctured with bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy’s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family told the station that he was likely to recover.
He should have started the first class at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are currently investigating whether the perpetrators could be under one of the injured men.
Investigators reported to CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge sleeves for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles oversaw the scene of the crime.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the sidewalk, there were sleeves.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests, and police are reportedly checking the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow on her arm as she was playing outside her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine under the women’s Olympic team in gymnastics and for more than one reason.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly: this team has three female gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many young girls of different skin colors.
The structure of this team, which rounds off Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team is finally reflecting the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, number one among female gymnasts has been an African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the top of this sport, but this is not how gymnastics classes across the country look.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, setting up, traveling, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families).
The majority of these clubs are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive all their training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to provide communities with even countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie with more affordable and accessible gymnastics training.
I founded my gymnastics foundation for 20 years.
At my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide youth with high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turning develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls become interested in gymnastics and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, motivated her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract, saying the NHS would be in a “no one country” and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are expected to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Committee for Assistant Physicians, said in a statement last night: “Assistant physicians continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly.”
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress needs to be made and the time runs out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes by means of talks met with the government's reluctance to participate, and sometimes with a deafening silence.
That was a promise Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of the assistant doctors.”
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further labour action.
The last strike in late April saw a delay of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike post chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS staff, urged the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work combat measures achieve nothing of the little, but burden already overburdened teams and service providers and cause patients, nurses and their families only worry, distress and interruption."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Physicians and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other key issues — such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional break, training boxes, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education leave, and the gender pay gap in medicine — were a sign of how serious the employers, the Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health were with respect to compliance in May.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2-per-day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2-per-day medication after authorities have recommended that it be given to more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NHS Regulatory Authority NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NHS Regulatory Authority NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form coatings.
If the lining breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The NICE guideline draft, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke — often with disastrous consequences.”
Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand the available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness Makes Electoral Fraud Flourish in Muslim Areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the grounds of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread election fraud being knowingly ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is verbally attacking the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to “oversensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion.”
The former minister of integration and local government, who is now a king of anti-corruption, said intimidating voters on religious grounds would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up shutdown tapes outside election booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry a passport to prove their identity in elections.
Currently, a voter only needs to give his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
It demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
“This not only serves against election fraud, but also aims to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the current mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court ruled that Rahman “perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical manner” and that he silenced his critics with allegations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have run his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation in which one person votes as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
In particular, he expressed alarming concerns about the fraudulent postal election, in which older members of the Muslim community pressured people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including carrying ID cards to prove identity.
“As evidence, pressure has been placed on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to elect in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities of Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
“There were concerns that ... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to ‘politically correct’ oversensitivities to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing mailing lists to stop “elected.”
The report, which Theresa May is considering, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the voting directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once they have cast their voice to prevent someone from voting twice.
Systematic verification of a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic letter-election.
Prohibits political activists from processing complete letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
Give the police the authority to set up gates to electoral stations.
An amendment to the law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Prohibition of photography in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations (excluding Wales).
Intensifying training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the election booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The Election Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy inappropriate because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices,” he said.
He was convicted for a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "de-hack controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling at Tower Hamlets was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's Radler double-walker and other famous double-walkers from Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are out of line about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot this week, who has proven to be an impressive double-crosser of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only gold-fighting athlete this summer who has his own famous double-crosser - at least not if you can trust social media.
In honor of the Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces that are flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians that are more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Apart from Kate’s double-walker on the bike track, many people on the internet pointed out what a certain archer could be like the twin of A-celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after images he looks terribly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star appeared.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I myself don't see much resemblance, except for the facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
“He’s a good-looking guy, so I guess I’ll take that as a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come into focus this year: the striking similarity between the British wide jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is said to be able to go through as a double-walker for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
One gear higher: This user thinks Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-tanned skin and blond hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attested by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
Theory put in the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user expressed her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, U.S. football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is nearly identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile that resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming squad indignant viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypic Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “went off like a hound” and during the race like “a pig died.”
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming pool.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS’s commentator team to add more “color,” could be heard saying, “This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost her connection, baby.”
Too excited, went off like a pig, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the floating squad 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to bridge the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and the language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on show."
Ai Yanhan of China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming squad for women in the following dimensions: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, in which many spoke to him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly afterwards Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment about a swim performance being broadcast."
It was an unfortunately chosen phrase, and we are sorry that it happened.”
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to the people who responded to the comments on Twitter
Scott Russel must apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and pasted its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on show and our followers on social media last night.
To clarify one thing, Byron’s comments referred to the swimmer’s performance and not her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen wording. Byron is very sorry for what he has said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show, trying to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention to be construed as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad on the CBC Olympic show," he said.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance and not to her as a person."
Of course, there was no intention of disrespect and I am very sorry.”
Buyers in Primark outraged by woman trying out shameless underwear in the middle of the shop
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
To exacerbate the situation, she patterned what she looked like in it, pulled it out and put it back on the shelf.
She continued browsing and tried four pairs of underpants at a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store in Folkestone’s Bouverie Place shopping mall, where the woman tried the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried the underwear, "she put on her clothes again and left the shop without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the store she took a pair of underpants out of the showroom, took off her own tights and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, naughty like Oskar."
“Everyone stared at her taking off the pants she obviously didn’t like as she put them back on the shelf.”
She repeated the same with three other pants before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, dressing up again and going out.
“She didn’t seem to bother that she was watching someone — or thinking about the person who might be buying the pants she’d tried on.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that were wearing another person and that weren't washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "As I have noticed, the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
“I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman was wearing them and pulling them out again and they weren’t washed.”
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place Tuesday, August 9 at our Folkstone branch."
All eligible products were withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from weapon attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers on close distance.
Regardless of whether they approach you from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber.
When approaching you from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," Mizrachi says.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting him in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with the knee in the groin and twist as the attacker bends in pain, the gun out of his hands, hit him with the run in the face and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker's chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi feels.
But keep in mind that in the event of a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright shoves his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler underwent a serious examination of his immune system and choking reflex - by sipping some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shoved his trains on a euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a wash button on a train toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before dissolving each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will engage in.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to light.
The thought of licking off the rinse button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he leaked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to flushing buttons on toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test
“Already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water.”
In the film, he did live up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample specimen showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after its luminometer number was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "This is close to the worst thing I smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valio’s Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We conducted crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where it was quite difficult.
I’m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products that contain attached lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroys social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
A non-social family left their social home after a <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 loss after terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked cooperative employees found the property in irreparable condition.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden floors were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for home management at Cornwall Housing, said she worried that the apartment could no longer be repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don’t have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their reputation is so.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and police said the terror the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was ordered for anti-social behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the property where drugs were traded in the past, wooden floors were torn apart.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly to the police
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner to leave the property this week after giving them an extended 11-week period to voluntarily move out.
The displacement was praised by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called on a regular basis for 20 years.
On the overgrown side of the town hall, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added, “It is a disgrace that the tenant has failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a delocalization is always the last step Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will comfort some neighbors and convey the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation
House administration workers will now have to clean up garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 worth of scales, paraphernalia and cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug on commercial intent.
She claimed the money was for a tombstone from her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they will dislodge tenants who do not comply with house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police Department said the displacement was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
“This goes to those who think they can behave without self-reporting, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior,” she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a deep-flying military jet overflying beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force laid down an incredible crash flight
The Air Force said it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military aircraft flying almost in close proximity over the sun worshippers on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what came to them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By on social media, said: “It really flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing.”
Nuno Arroja added, “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me.”
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese air force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby surface fires, but air forces insisted that security was not at any time at risk.
Land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force today stated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca worries against Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona are fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans are competing in the duel for the Spanish Supercup away against FC Sevilla, the rematch takes place three days later at Camp Nou.
The double-winner has to relinquish Neymar, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament, with the inferior cup finalist and governing European league champion, among others.
Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament plunge in the knee during training, with which the one-on-one question at Barca is clarified at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been vying for number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique gave up a clear decision so far and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen took the lead in most other competitions.
Before the first compulsory match of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness condition of the team, which was humiliated with 0:4 in a test game of Liverpool on Saturday.
Even in the 3:2 trial against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. could not really convince.
Sevilla, on the other hand, has to digest the 2:3 loss after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and seeks the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league of table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic table tennis champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and title defender Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
Thus, the World Rankings-First won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes in the World Cup, World Tour Finals and Olympics.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
As expected, the two Chinese made it into the final game and won the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would win the singles title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic team was former SVS-NÖ legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between sets and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stand and let their protectors alone in fair competition.
"The matches so far I have played for my country.
“In the finals I play for myself,” Zhang had consistently said.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to really fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he determined the pace on the record and left Zhang there only 13 points in total.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected rousing match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were sufficiently breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had inflicted a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitry Ovtcharov, after which he was in medical treatment, had to "finally" settle for sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic fourth in similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits 'massive problems' in election campaign
The leadership of U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive worries about losing its majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the usually large-scale and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.
Having thrown 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts are growing about his success in the fight for the White House.
“We have tremendous problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in key states like Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
False reports of his candidacy were to blame, he resumed his well-known media record.
Republican strongholds shake
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were on the same page.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton’s rise again: “Same way as I have done so far.”
And pushed afterwards: "This will either be successful, or I will take a very nice, long vacation".
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party has threatened to cancel funds in support of his campaign should he not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, they wanted to support Republican candidates for Congress more strongly.
Olympia: Trio of doping fraud
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenyan athletes threaten harm after the second doping affair at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee said it would set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official said that former sprinter and today’s coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya’s team leadership by the doping controllers.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," the IAAF said in a statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," said Kenya's mission chief Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s list of exercise checks.
In 2015, Ferguson Rotich was fourth in the World Cup in Beijing over 800 metres.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been removed from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offenses.
Announcing the IOC’s more than 2,000 doping target checks before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out beforehand that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country ahead of the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
Subsequently, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control complies with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country’s athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A series of TV reports from the ARD have repeatedly made allegations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It was proven that this sport was systematically and comprehensively doped.
Russia's athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical and fulfilled with the role of Mary a youthful dream.
In the orchestra trench the Simón Bolívar orchestra led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he soars.
We always say that it is very Latin-American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an elderly Maria.
She remembers with sorrow her affection with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all because it is musically exceptional.
And then there was Maria’s personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
She is smart, naive, and very passionate.
“She is very similar to me, to my Italian character, which I have as a Roman woman,” Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is an immensely generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
Directing is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
It’s such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly current: "This play is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
These are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl Joining ISIS Killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group’s bulwark in the country, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only good is — as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone — to stop people from ever making that decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded a plane heading for Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was informed that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid Says Clinton Will Stay at Garland as a Supreme Court Candidate in Case of Election Victory
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he expects Clinton to select Garland “with some degree of certainty.”
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he is speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeal.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination, were lackeys and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats wants naked calendar for "women and men"
Treats Magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses Calendar.
Treats editor Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his naked magazine differs from old-school playboys because “Playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the calendar does as well.
“We need to return to depicting timeless and classic nakedness where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by these images of a female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
“Those who don’t adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases,” said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-nearest Dialogue and World Foundation.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of refugees to flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand," believes the union chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
“In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand seekers of protection from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition,” said Ali Toprak, chairman of the association.
Because the government has already covered up Kurdish strongholds with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey are on the run.
After the failed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
“It can’t be that a state that takes in refugees itself can produce refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The head of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitic cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds.
“They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years,” said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government position itself "as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
In Germany, too, there is a “hex hunt” against Erdogan critics.
For the first time in the last few months, I no longer feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement is also afraid of many Turks fleeing abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as a Gülen supporter destroys teachers and other academics' professional existence.
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases, by the way, also the kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup.
As of June 30, these were 11,386 people, and thus almost 29 percent of all those recognized as entitled to asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled from war, poverty or lack of perspective.
Asylum seekers under the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer elections - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.
In 2021, the parliamentary election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the parliament of Schwerin has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because stupider than so far it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and country election campaign - that bites itself.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the electoral fighters, are on vacation.
The majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they cannot choose the Landtag.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count out voices, are only struggling to pick up.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass the election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It is exciting how strongly newcomer AfD is cutting off and what remains in the end suitable for coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is running an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one looks away from his big posters.
He travels the countryside, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary word-carving predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD’s flourishing.
Their refugee policy, their “we can do this” has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to run election campaigns at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel’s Bundestag electoral district lies in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxons there than Mecklenburgers and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently complained in the NDR.
But it is also no harm to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.
This, Kokert says, only plays a “subordinate role”.
The Union has also noticed that it is breaking away the base in the countryside, that it must make great efforts to find a wire to the people again.
They are like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any in the far reaches of the country.
The council of CDU voter Kokert to his comrades, however, is also self-explanatory: "You must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats last fell 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and only shortly before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD still won with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the parliament.
They turn holiday-not into a modern virtue and shift their election campaign largely to the internet.
“Online elections,” states president Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green electoral fighters are searching for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curving through the Mecklenburg Lakes with a houseboat and still enjoys it.
Their impression: "Election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are not a penalty".
B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffer from blocking
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being rehabilitated.
For those responsible for the construction work, which begins at 5.30 a.m. and ends at 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
“They’ve done it all pretty crappy,” says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, until the end of October everything should be ready.
It is also praised for the support of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of relief entrances.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was also lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.
Citizens can now travel on both sides of the B 27 again from often.
The evasion traffic through the town seems to be declining.
"There were some significant complaints," says the deputy head of the rehabilitation department, Florian King, who is responsible for the transport management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise, because many sleek paths were searched and more relied on their navigation than on signs.
This resulted in some trucks fraying in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not respected, the municipality increased demands for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
“There have been significant breaches,” says King, who asked himself about the situation on the spot.
There have been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was in the Tempo 30 zone at 77 kilometers per hour.
Since the construction site has moved on, but it has become quieter.
For the businessmen on the B 27 it is only a little comfort that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don’t like to look at the cards.
But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales declines in them, lets anyone you ask look through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produces for other companies, for whom the refurbishment has hardly any consequences.
At the car dealership Maier, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highly slight decline", but also admits that of course "the running customer is missing".
The most crowded are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
This is already life-threatening.
Not just him, but all the restaurants had "hit it hard".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro turnover.
The loss of revenues amounts to “far over 50 percent”.
The road refurbishment has thrown back its operation "by two years".
Half of his employees had to be fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been fired, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt responded to a question from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, by stating that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27.
Göhner knows of other counties, where something like this has been handled more generously.
With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, it refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars now come by less often because of the complicated traffic.
If you can’t get here, it’s nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return after the end of the rehabilitation work.
Despite the BSE and bird flu crises, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
In the name of counter-terrorism, laws are constantly being screwed on.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the German interior minister said at the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other, more in-depth issues would be discussed first within the parties.
I also participate in it.
As interior minister, however, he was keen on results and on an “achievable consensus” within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has allowed some time to pass before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
But now they are all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: that a new security agency should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second run for proposals that were not yet to be made with the SPD: he wants to criminalize sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and jihadists with dual citizenship to knock off the German passport.
“That will be difficult points for the SPD,” admits the CDU man.
He still considers this reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chance anyway.
A few new ideas de Maizière presents as well.
They have it partly in themselves: he plans quick procedures for deportations and more ways to detain people before deportation.
Refugees who are targeted to the country should have their smartphones checked beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or consciously throw away their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.
Some things also seem uneasy and leave questions open.
And on some points - when it comes to the unequal treatment of patients, for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But there is no denying that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about safety due to the high refugee numbers.
And things that people were deeply concerned about could not be excluded even in election seasons.
Internal security has been put in the spotlight.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election fights.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly taking a stand on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a lot of progress between the two parties.
First a quirky dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then a security policy ideas collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the department heads also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives for reconciling tones here.
He doesn't think he's going to turn away from the double passport.
We have settled the discussion in Germany.
Reopening is not meaningful.
And in the case of a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to be shown.
There's a lot in there that could cause a fight.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signals a cautious willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security".
Volkswagen is still on a glimpse.
Despite the diesel scandals, the number of shipments worldwide is rising.
But not in all markets it goes well.
In the recall action, there are vortices about a term.
Volkswagen starts deliveries more moderately in the second half of the year.
Europe’s largest car manufacturer has continued to show an advantage in the past year, despite the diesel affair, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July, the VW core brand weakened, especially in Western Europe, again burdening total sales, as the Dax-listed company reported.
The VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide in July with 449,100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost one-sixth.
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July mainly to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also burdened, a spokeswoman explained.
In the U.S., where the emission affair first escalated, there is also a minus to be booked.
Big support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected home brand of Lower Saxony is still clearly due to the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a drop in delivery of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler was able to continue to show a sales increase from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, with 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW reaffirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
After the conversion, the car manufacturer will issue a "equal warranty" certificate to the customer, but will not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called in business circles on Friday.
This is due to legal intricacies.
The "Focus" reported that Volkswagen is now providing its German customers with a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW must fully comply with the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and that all vehicle type-approval values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, a half-year after the conversion, come to a workshop with an engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important to avoid in the customer interest that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal leads to uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands penalty interest from wealthy savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in cash or day-to-day accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: normal savers "would not have to be afraid to pay for their austere penalty interest".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4% penalty interest.
From September onwards, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will reimburse this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on cash accounts or day-to-day accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," Paul said.
For some time now, he has been guarding 40 million euros, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he cannot use.
"They are on my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost," the bank chief said.
"I can't spend 4,000 euros for every million."
He now transfers the costs according to the polluter pays principle.
Leaving the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already seen four robberies, I don't want the fifth one!" said the bank's board of directors.
Most customers would have understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association said: “The ECB’s extreme monetary policy course incurs considerable costs for all banks.”
Bearing them alone is “no longer-lasting business.”
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for banking, credit cards or bank transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land with its Skatbank branch had made headlines in 2014 with penal interest on deposits of more than three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "We don't expect private customers to have to pay comprehensive fees for deposits, for this reason the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said there was "a clientele at Lake Tegernsee, which is a little more abundantly equipped by the fortune".
"This can be a problem for a small bank" if it guards money for free.
Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association "is not currently aware of any other banks that charge an expense substitute for deposits from private customers," spokesman Ernst said.
The President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June: "The threshold of going negative to the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is tough, and there is a threat of investors disengagement from competition.
Customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in the breadth.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the comment section to sow it with harsh insults under the pseudonym Not All Lonely MenAlders, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-anticipated resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are expected to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news story on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and wildly gesture before I stop, hold my hands and say something defining like, “Well, let’s take a closer look at it.”
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent vendors once resided - there are still a handful of fantastic specialty record stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, presumably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
“I guess,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn’t afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a little too young to buy for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverts and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves prompted to buy back their old records.
Of the conversations I have had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again,” he says.
This would explain the boom in record revival followers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took a shot at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record envelopes, items that evoke happy youth memories.
“I think sometimes it can be filling an emptiness or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort,” Wez says.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with a lot of people.
It’s an easy way to get mentally engaged.
“We are like their social workers!” a worker bursts out of a pile of plates.
An ICM poll in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month haven’t heard it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report I would probably look very worried as I scroll through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
“Someone just came in here recently and said, ‘I don’t own a record player, but I’d like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product loaded, less music loaded.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who are only slowly coming in.
Fopp, who has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a more colorful audience when I walk in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roaring from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.
None of them look very lonely, but gnawing psychological traumas are hard to spot when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the shop for a few minutes and looking at the variety of records for sale.
She's more of a shop window walk than a big purchase.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting plates isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is...” she drives away with an in love sigh.
I don’t know how to explain it – it’s truly unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I appear to be patterning the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics that are essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure plate art.
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research has shown that YouGov’s results are correct, they ignore, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female record collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record shops and scrolling through records while avoiding the staring glance of an eerie, 30-year-old fake moderator who asks nothing over the shoulders of unaware middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
More scientifically, the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who is investigating sharks, says the record was for a female that is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer on demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 provisional stores where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros at provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which carries a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They further stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than feeding just people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the camp’s non-profit Jungle Book Kids’ Café, which offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to safeguard the Kids’ Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure “would be a catastrophe for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old.”
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals over the course of the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains fighter
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, cyclist Tony Martin does not want to be underwhelmed.
“I’m keeping an eye on the World Cup, staying confident and continuing to fight,” the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time-driving," Martin said.
He must calmly analyze the reasons that led to the debacle.
At the time trial World Cup in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to compete for the title.
“I’m going to take a closer look at everything we’ve changed in recent times.”
"That's my position," wrote the three-time World Time Racing Champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday's 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennis professional Siegmund misses semi-final
Laura Siegemund’s move ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: Metzingen’s World Rankings 32nd missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA No.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to pass through her stroke once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the final round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of summer games had last been there in 1992.
Never before has a German duo been in a single Olympic semifinal.
Group joins start-up for live video game streaming
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft wants to benefit from it too.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money will flow for the acquisition, Microsoft did not disclose on Thursday.
Beam launched its offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players, confront enemies, and provide equipment.
Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
Employees of the start-up, based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, California, Beam co-founder and chief executive Matt Salsamendi said.
For the customers, therefore, nothing should change through the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Popular platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased by online retailer Amazon in 2014 – for nearly $1 billion.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google’s mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s razor has to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, among others in Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are intended to transport speed sinners particularly effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident focal points, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at highway construction sites or to be refurbished bridges with temporary speed limits, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure that the speed limit is adhered to with a stationary flasher.
However, a durable mobile structure can be too dangerous or complicated.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously across several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, the trailer can be moved with any car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in measurement mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and by the way also fireproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France has recently reordered 100 pieces, following an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK gets silver in 7 rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
Britain’s impressive 7-er Rugby performance came to an abrupt stop in the final on Thursday evening in the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a 43-7 result at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, retracement, line running and raw force to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks’ significant loss, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could be attributed to them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best shape in this form.
It might be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.
The UK had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, they lost every game with Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one here.
This blow will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks of GB bounce off for fun.
Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. felt like they were running on buses, and the World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau hit the corner.
With four minutes left, Jerry Tuwai attacked another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A tremendous tackle by Mitchell stopped Leone Nakarawa’s mountain to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua led a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reboot and there was still over a minute of play time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou preached through further weak tackles of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the Fijian gap...for an entire four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant interplay from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long run in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stand.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame continued the i-pitch with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked destructively beaten in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a tight semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with impressive footwork and scored a goal below the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning Inspired to Rudder Victory by Fighting with Trainer’s Cancer
There will be no more emotinal gold than in these games and that means something.
From the first rowing strike to the last, 220 hard hits that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who sat on the row, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was all present when they rode the second Olympic gold in a consecutive two without a taxwoman, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39th unbeaten commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference, and no one was more helpful than the coach who didn’t know 30 months ago if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.
If you don't, it'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate to be able to start treatment in early 2014, off-season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have had a better coach or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn’t keep up with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to break down, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in trial, stay in trial."
It is really important not to be carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to do something great.
We didn’t want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t mean to say this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better,” she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
Ruppert Göller, Managing Director of the "Veitensteingruppe" Water Purpose Association, is retiring.
The association is considered to be "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
It was said some time ago in the original tone in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio.
Shortly afterwards, the Wasserforum honored the purpose association of the government of Lower Franconia.
The work of the Veitenstein group was considered "a model throughout Bavaria".
Behind all this stands Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the Zweckverband, of which 28 years as Managing Director.
He has now retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, produces about 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 towns and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities, there are water supply contracts.
The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn’s mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a waterman in 1985 and appointed as CEO of the purpose association in 1988.
“His tasks have been very diverse, ranging from water management and maintenance to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions, to emergency responses on weekends,” she said.
The commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), purchases of land in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation to farmers, the rehabilitation of the high tanks (1999), the re-acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes were highlighted as outstanding events.
There has been no standstill and innovations have been repeated because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart for his Water Purpose Association and he has lived the Water Purpose Association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the district of Lower Franconia.
He received a lot of praise and appreciation for this.
Rupert Göller praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water keeper and he was a loyal man.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the construction of wells and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, they had to work all night long so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn was once only maintained because the high tank of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer aus Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with her son Tiago's autism - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was detected in her son, she believed she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and now learns privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, if I ask him something about what was two years ago when I sang at Milan's Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection to the bass bariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in Bargteheide - man shoots on life partner
A 35-year-old man shot at his partner at 10.45 a.m. in an apartment building in Bargteheide, Stormarn district, on Friday and wounded her dead.
"The man himself called us and claimed to have shot his partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, and he is being hunted publicly.
In the meantime nationwide, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a baldness.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
It is, however, a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man is wearing a bald.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun, the police said.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110.
The police call it a “relationship state.”
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information about the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
“This is a killing offence.”
“We are not saying more at the moment,” said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene of the crime.
Steel - Lighting for the German steel industry
The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared millions of additional costs.
The financial burdens threatened by the sector from green electricity support are off the table.
It remains with the exemption from the renewable energy levy on the existing facilities for so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) to the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I'm really happy that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption to cash in.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry faced additional costs of between 120 and 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel plants are replaced will an EEG levy of 20 percent occur.
But this is also not being raised in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on self-generating.
This largely defines the status quo of the previous regulation.
Gabriel’s successful efforts are of particular importance to the steel industry.
“In terms of our ‘steel is the future’ campaign, this is a first step.”
“More must follow.”
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen as the world’s largest producer country, China, threw massive steel onto the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed a bit.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel have an effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have been lightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primeur Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Lastly, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to rule out closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced roughly six percent less raw steel than in the previous month at 3.4 million tonnes, according to the Steel Association on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the quantity produced has now declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year’s level.
Thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects an increase in output in the coming months.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing is Good for Seniors
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher’s school she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
“Singing moves me – emotionally and physically,” she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good to her health and to her mind.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
Through regular meetings, seniors can make and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience also Ursel Kipp made in her choir: "To talk and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, Hackler says.
Seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who demand their lungs regularly do not get out of the pulse so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Group of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, singing together was of much greater importance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs awakens many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, demented people themselves are reminded of past events.
When singing, the head is also required a special performance, explains Lenz.
Concentrating on your own voice and a set rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers is a huge cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone are practicing not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show yourself: if I practice for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes missing?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the familiar circle sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in an ecclesial choir, you can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with internet research.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - this applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to cries of young animals
In Hanover, biologists have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauen did not leave the males cold - however, unlike the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can recognize the degree of excitement of cat babies on the miauw of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens that are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the miauing of less and heavily excited young animals are either not perceptible or not significant to the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology on Friday.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH animal holding were observed.
On the one hand, they were pre-played calls from little ones, who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their findings to be meaningful despite the small sample size.
"All females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, responded differently to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the loudspeaker faster when it played the call of the much more excited kittens.
This ability may be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already repeatedly investigated the responses of women and men to baby noises in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches for Supercup with 'Gala'
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
Turkey has issued an arrest warrant against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match will take place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is required.
Already in the imposition of the state of emergency after the overthrow attempt in July, the government asserted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
There is no stopping in front of football either.
The prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a supporter of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, is still valid until October, in fact this has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks.
Erdogan declared that the nightly “democracy watches” in public squares across the country had ended on Wednesday.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas Workers' Club traditionally do not count among the President's friends.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With the cup winner "Gala" it will especially arrive on Lukas Podolski again.
With 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as a topscorer for his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" praised him: "He was the best in the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season found a conciliatory conclusion for the record-breaking champion.
After the preliminary knockout in the Champions League, the "Lions" also expired early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it was only sixth.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win.
“We did that and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season goals as the Süper-Lig goaltender king.
That’s also why fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old’s return.
Gomez, who was contracted with AC Florenz and only borrowed from Besiktas after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return due to the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the magazine "Kicker" quoted club boss Fikret Orman as saying.
But the striker would have to be willing to give up about a third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
In spite of doping, these athletes still have medal chances at Olympics in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletic sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Russian swimmer Julija Jefimova, who had filed for a doping ban shortly before the games, was ruthlessly whispered and exaggerated at her start (100 meters of chest).
There was a strange scenery: with a smile she was still proud in the hall and provoked with her appearance.
When it was determined that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke into a jubilant storm.
However, there are many other athletes who will start at the Olympics in Rio despite the doping history.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and former World Champion has been running even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m squad/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion in 2010 had to sit off a six-month lockdown after being detected taking the painkiller Oxycodone.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, 2013 World Champion and 2010-2016 European Champion was tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the intentional ingestion and was suspended for six months.
The four widest throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-team/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
A remedy for penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was deprived of so many medals afterwards.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the EM title in 2006 for testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympics following a ruling by the International Sports Court CAS.
At 80.04 m, he is ranked second in the world ranking.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was tested positive only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old world champion, clues were found to take a banned dietary supplement, the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA’s lockout was mild and expired on July 13.
Bomb attack in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said on Friday.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave it again.
She planned her trip home in early September.
Whether further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern towns of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also Austrian citizens is unclear for the time being.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
Located about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin, two bombs exploded in a nightclub on Thursday evening.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more explosives went up again, according to the authorities, another person was killed.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the early morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach of Patong, which is popular with tourists, according to police.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosives went into the air in a flowerbed outside the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several injuries.
It is assumed to be related to the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.
"The bombings carry the same manuscript," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters on Friday.
"We believe this is a coordinated attack."
It’s too early to comment on possible motives – but it’s probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising or international terrorism.
“This is just local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces,” a spokesman in Bangkok said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received intelligence reports of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police ordered their officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always smaller bombings in Thailand, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that has been used for years by Thailand’s king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the bombs explode, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its homepage recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding areas.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is advised against unnecessary travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This will also give the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moved towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, holds for itself that it has brought the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not been able to control the revolt of Muslim rebels that has been sweeping for years in the far south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing “Identitarian Movement” has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
According to several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also put the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' indications for aspirations against the free democratic basic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of the constitutional protection of the German press agency in Berlin.
For example, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist manner.
We are also observing the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group of French roots that has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes “multicultural madness”, “uncontrolled mass immigration” and “the loss of one’s own identity through over-alienation”.
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitarians".
Maaßen said that his authority had closely coordinated with the state offices in the decision.
“Groups like the ‘Identitarian Movement’ are trying to pick up their target group wherever they stand,” he said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with pop music.
Islamists, as well as right-wing extremists, would do so.
This is not an advertisement for your own sake.
Propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the constitution, possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain persons who are extremist, changes its direction and becomes so extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But in recent years we have found that there can be right-wing terrorism structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming who plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks on other right-wing extremist motives.
However, there is no recognizable control of legal terrorism across Germany or across Europe.
The previous groups have emerged at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that many attacks were carried out on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
This is the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.
“Many people have committed crimes that were not at all pre-empted by right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or have voted for example for the CDU, SPD or the left, but have then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist sentiments.”
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet hit
It is not always the Olympics or world records that determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This is demonstrated by the brave appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swims so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images.
It just disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
In social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a delay of 48 seconds and took 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was given a special start-up right by the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more known.
Since most athletes run in Ethopia, Habte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte gets ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media have called him the “whale robber.”
Based on a "wealth belly", the English tabloid "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only hit with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter freestyle, didn’t matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a run over 100 meters freestyle alone.
Moussambani was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never before completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop in New Square has been stolen.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder left her business on Monday at around 5:30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at around 8:15 p.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the checkout.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
Video surveillance is also not available.
Trump doesn't see the impending election defeat as tight
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
If the election to the U.S. president fails, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He'll just go on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, he wouldn’t care: “Ultimately it will either work out, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump said.
He called President Barack Obama and Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terror militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters the trade of electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently great.
The Post plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle as well.
Soon, the company plans to start trading with the van.
The Post intends to offer its electric transporters from next year also on the free car market.
"We want to go into sales to third parties," a postal spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been testing for months to see if it should also sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which will deliver letters and packages to other businesses.
Post-President Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel" the Bonner Konzern will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the factory, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year per shift.
Gerdes announced that the Group would considerably expand its fleet of electric cars and aim to make a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
“We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're going to change the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany’s roads since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is exchanging its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly, but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggests that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann will become all the more insecure the longer the promised successes remain.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the world’s number five in the industry is facing a new start in personnel.
GfK’s CEO wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
As of September 1, the previous member of the Board of Management, Gerhard Hausruckinger, will take over the leadership of the Board of Management, the company said.
He is to officially assume the role of a "speaker of the board" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesperson did not want to mention details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
Investor circles said on Friday that the shareholders were most recently disappointed by the continued lack of successes of the restructuring launched years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK-Top since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not yet seen after five years," he said.
Given the latest bad GfK business figures, every shareholder will at some point become uneasy.
“If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do that too,” he said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company was unable to stop its loss drive even in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the previous year's comparable quarter.
In the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent by EUR 721.2 million.
Earnings in the second quarter were mainly impacted by the company’s declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The corporate depreciation of 139 million euros required in the Consumer Experience business area resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK still generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
In an accident of a coach with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (county district Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to dodge, according to her information, an accommodating truck, which partly drove on the counterroad.
The bus departed to the right of the road and slipped into a trench, as a spokeswoman for the police told Aurich/Wittmund.
“Due to the location of the bus, people were not able to leave the bus on their own,” she said.
The firefighters liberated the inmates.
Six ambulances and one emergency car arrived at the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back by a regular bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
Investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater will be 3.44 euros per cubic metre from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater system instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the sewage charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
According to an excessive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach determined that undercovers for these sewage systems abound.
The Kasendorf market is obliged on legal grounds to operate the plants in a cost-covered manner.
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into their wallets.
Fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As administrative director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-coverages from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The serious increases in fees were due to the fact that all three sewage plants were relatively small and had a very low sewage attack, ranging from 6800 to 12,000 cubic meters per year.
Due to the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the amount of waste water in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
In addition, in the past calculation period, rehabilitation and repair expenses were incurred to a considerable extent for all three plants, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the wastewater system in Azendorf due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pump plant, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the Lopp pond clarification plant, after nearly 20 years of operation, the first clarification pond had to be excavated, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses came the continued care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that, in the light of the sewage attack in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance "completely outweigh".
Schmidt added that the market community has been spared great entertainment costs at wastewater systems over the past 20 years.
The situation for the above-mentioned plants will remain precarious in the long term, according to the Steinhäuser, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Wastewater Purpose Association cannot be extended by these plants because they are deficit facilities.
Bulgaria registers inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
Annual average inflation for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% measured according to the CPI.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, the price of the following groups of consumer goods increased compared to the previous month: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); Transportation (1.8%); Leisure and culture (6.3%); Restaurants and hotels (1.2%); Various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat 'Anime' Effect Criticized as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already borders on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, property twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All misconduct is made public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, accusing them that the app would promote Blackface or propagate white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested to some users this week a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and flushed cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Spapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely disseminated about the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and mildly uncomfortable."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the devaluing extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company crossing these cultural stumbling wires.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people — who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents — might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat’s filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, “it’s much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, male-only leadership and ended his essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a recruiter focused on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said she will close her Snapchat account, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that's not OK."
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, congressional committee finds
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their views on American efforts to fight the Islamic State.
Central Command, for short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“News information typically nicked by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly drew a more positive picture of American anti-terrorism efforts than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and was consistently more positive than analysis by other intelligence services,” the report said.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, said in a statement.
The errors of leadership in Centcom reach to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
Although it does not provide direct evidence that Obama administration leaders gave instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts," the report said.
For example, a Centcom publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the heads of Central Command changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans started the task force after they were told analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports of Islamic State.
The report released on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom are underway by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force’s conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democrat in the committee, in a statement.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, “delayed the release of intelligence reports,” damaged morale among analysts, and “gave excessively little room for deviating opinions.”
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of White House interference with the Centcom analysts regarding a “certain political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon’s inspector general, which were picked up after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on reports from Congress while the Inspector General’s investigations were still underway.
But he also stated that “experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense.”
The investigations have had a backlash on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
However, last year’s allegations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes over more than ten years ago when a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper about how the then administration under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, envisioned only a small occupying force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker, according to government officials, noted that contrary to the government’s statements, airstrikes against the Islamic State-owned refineries would have no significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as these provisional refineries would have started selling oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander at the time, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain is about to take place
One day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the women’s American field hockey team in a match against India on Thursday that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember ever doing that.
“I don’t know,” she said.
I'm not one of those people who keep their gates in mind.
However, she knows that the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in the first place in their group with the British, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win first and second place.
The first-placed will be out of the way of the strong Dutch women who lead the other group a little longer.
Whatever the game ends on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed on the last of 12 places at the previous London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she was unable to qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and so things began to turn to the better.
“A culture change, a mental change, and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to completely tear the row around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 until the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She ran a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled in the middle and jumped the ball into the goal to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to score one goal in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
“We are in a good position,” said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable, a raging race between competition and pursuit.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed from the armpit shooter to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen while talking to your neighbor in the queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been under these well-known names that are sent at Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertisements, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencing.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the chest swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely over the last 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who managed to make it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians that for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for a clown's school than for the Olympics for the unexplained ear.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just a grounded enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish tremor of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unites it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."
Aspiring victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly 30 feet into the air and have a series of falling movements (turning, hedgehogs and hopping) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program by execution, difficulty level and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopefuls must go on in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down in the playground.
They chase not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also another mocking goal in television broadcasting: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
But it’s also what I feel tiring of watching these games myself.
The trampoline offers a respite.
The trampoline jumper vector is at the top.
A move forward is not the goal.
He or she crashes, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Again, there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.
It’s as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women’s qualifying and finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men’s on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably be overlooked in general tumult.
If awareness-raising can only be achieved through the pursuit and objectification of male athletes - as the male US tournamentists recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits his air-fighting, new fan base.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia encountered violent government resistance.
Witnesses say tens of protesters were killed during clashes with police during gunfire.
Is Ethiopia in the process of collapsing?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding fundamental political change.
The government’s response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed tens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating on the protests, which are likely from last or early this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
“It has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future,” said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western assistance.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy – human rights organizations have consistently led the government’s oppression – opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the vast desert.
But that could change.
“If you oppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to the crushing handle in terms of the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies took the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; a fight over this twisted, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of simmering under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does on a regular basis, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they were gathering to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and business while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But that too is changing.
“We are coordinating under one umbrella,” said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, who make up about 6% of the population and who are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unpublished illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special envoys to deal with opponents and make them harmless.
“The current regime lacks this basic skill,” said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, appeared to have been ransacked by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer than in recent months and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disgust of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked businesses run by Tigray and hatred of the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin hike."
Donald Trump declares his claim that Obama founded ISIS was “sarcasm”
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to disperse the last controversy surrounding his campaign, saying that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terror group was not meant seriously.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s communication skills as to whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly with the American public.
It also brings his fellow fighters, who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rode back in regards to Thursday’s claim, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to mean that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the day before when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump soften the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know about it.
The final storm of criticism rages down on Mr. Trump as he tries to focus his campaign on the economic situation over declining survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held talks on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already raised sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he garnered strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails, but he later declared “Of course I meant this sarcastic.”
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to row back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods to test how certain messages are picked up by his fans as they arrive, and then possibly ‘clarify’ depending on how the reaction is,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more causative tone as his polling figures have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist released on Friday showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he has become increasingly the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have put his loyal comrades in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying are legitimate political comments,” Mr. Giuliani said, so he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump’s statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbencher, completely wrong and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the administration under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding around and being biased against each of his words.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" television experts trying to understand him and said, "You can't do it!"
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.
Once pushed over the price of the market, Café in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, which did not have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were pushed out of its Bedford Avenue store front.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, “I know New York is change, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel excepted, and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe who owns and manages the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered to provide him with funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, retained a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers have also been pushed out by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
“I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb I liked,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered a blended chai tea that day instead of her usual iced coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing.
“I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they’re preparing my Everything bag with butter,” he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no resentment for the soap business taking over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special verb soap with the café’s cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
“I think we’ll still respond to their offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee in bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated on the ground when the café closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
“I had to smell it,” he said.
The Depressing Eating of the Economic Crisis in "Abundant Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a flavour for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as P<0xC3><0xA2>te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert a plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe’s last book “Chop Suey” talked about Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman in her book “97 Orchard” tells about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, “A Decent Meal,” which will appear at Harper Publishing on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, no-brainer snack in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the stock market crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hack roasts, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion of eating in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe Grinste.
"It must have been laid in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked paste was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" lists the ways in which the country dealt with no longer being the Claraffenland.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans,” Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally tense was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staples, the casserole as a "wonderful way to recycle food remnants," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappreciative ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular noon addition,” Coe says.
Ziegelmann goes on to say, “It was surreal.”
Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.
As never before or since, household economists—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943—have driven the country’s eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “household politicians” and to meet the challenge of turning pampoen like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical treats.
Especially tasty are the reports of the government’s response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s Lass-mich-cake-eating attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the million-dollar man of the world he became.
“He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate in a nearly gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn’t asked him to use his stomach as an example.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Ms. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolate prepared.
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, were discarded as soon as the country came back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated that they better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother-in-law – for example, how she couldn’t throw away food.
“She had a real fear of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windfall.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called prune whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a usual trick to miss a chic name to modest recipes.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe got a referral three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in Bomb Attack: He Was the Hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
The 30-year-old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that has saved almost 60,000 lives so far, according to Bild-Zeitung.
2,900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed houses and provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil defender showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the wreckage of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, saying according to the picture, "For me this is the real jihad."
“When I die to save lives, I think God sees a martyr in me.”
Shortly before Omar himself was killed in an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffering from shortness of breath.
"We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime’s deadly bomb was meant to hit terrorists.
Greenland’s oldest vertebrates are nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims at a good 1 km/h across the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get offspring at the age of 150.
Slowly, the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, reaching just 1,220 meters in an hour on average.
Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this slow lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insanity," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock commented on this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks become stone old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the icebergs off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow motion when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the iceberg and look for corpses that creep down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen caught from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters long.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the sharks' lens core using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is formed even before the sharks are born, and the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in their lens core.
Their birth was due to be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts launched larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal, 220 centimeters in length, the lens core, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapon experiments, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-breaking 502-centimeter shark may even be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals at 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks are apparently allowed to reproduce for at least one and a half centuries.
This is also a world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such Methusalems live mainly in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip on his neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there also often runs on austerity flames.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
Therefore, the heat loss of a gram of mouse is much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in double pack
The Municipal Council focused on building issues at the most recent meeting.
The committee welcomed the communication from Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the land, parceling and development issues have been clarified and applications for surveys have been submitted, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - extension section 1) to interested parties.
The municipality council is convinced that the building spaces in the rural and quiet residential community Schönau appeal to young families as well as high-profile seniors alike.
As it was said, from now on, construction volunteers can report to the town hall, the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the parcels in its September meeting.
In order also to be able to comply with requests for the settlement of further commercial enterprises, linked to the creation of jobs, the Municipal Council decided to amend the new land use plan created only in the spring of this year in sub-areas.
For example, the commercial area already designated there is expanded by two parcels in the sub-time area towards State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies moved from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, head of IW’s financial markets and real estate expertise field.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial institutions can continue to operate financial transactions across the EU from London.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far sufficient approval in the UK.
This is what big US banks are using.
Several banks have already announced to move jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which unites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the ESRB Risk Board.
While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important to the financial sector than the ECB.
“Proximity to the central bank is important for banks because it allows them to communicate directly with supervisors,” says IW professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, it is, like Dublin, less efficient in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city scores with easily available commercial properties.
“In Paris, it’s not that easy to find free high-quality offices,” Voigtländer says.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than its competitors thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking by Mercer, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg ranks 19th, Dublin ranks 33rd and Paris ranks 37th.
Although quality of life is a matter of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
But despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers say.
According to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking industry in London at the end of 2015, while in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives costs from Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of legal costs incurred in the Hepatitis C dispute with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from $200 million in compensation for the infringement of two Merck patents related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct on the part of Merck, including the pereide and other unethical acts.
U.S. Attorney General Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to equate Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work underpinned by Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead medicines.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed troops have recaptured complete control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are now combing through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij Military Council, who is allied with the DKS, told Reuters.
“The city is now under complete control, but we are doing clean-up work,” he told Reuters.
Clintons Earn $10.75 Million in 2015 and Pay 34.2% Federal Taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which gave the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech fees; the former Secretary of State gave a $3 million income from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her time in the State Department.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, publishes his tax returns for the past ten years along with his wife Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns even though they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited as the reason for his refusal of a tax audit by the tax authorities.
“They’re on the move,” Clinton’s campaign helper Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democrats’ presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are complete.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charitable organizations, his business practices, and various other ties, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already plunged into the issue and posted a video on the internet on Friday asking high-ranking Republican Trump to publish his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns,” she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s for two years, and a New York Times business journalist cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors on Friday who said that could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a regulation named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, to meet Trump to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also undergone a tax audit by the IRS and Trump had “fear” of voters rather than tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign published a tax return back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return showed that they borrowed only $100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and income of $109,000.

Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservatives in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going to human-inhabited settlements – throwing condoms on them filled with chilipudders.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has intensified its support, along with U.S. Nature Conservation, by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and harvest without harming animals.
Previously, many have used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
“Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to see a change in their attitudes within these communities, where they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant,” said Damian Bell, Managing Director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include illuminating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework into a condom, the end of which is turned towards the ignition cord.
When ignited, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on chilipudder into the air.
A touch is usually already out to chase the elephant away.
A last option is a thrower that fires a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: no kiosk construction on the St. Goarer Rhine bank
Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects are accepted by traders with a kissing hand - however, retail in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the City Council unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"Basically, we welcome new tradesmen, but this kiosk does not fit at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine," Michael Hubrath told the CDU.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel after Israeli code was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media turmoil after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli prefix because it had "requested" Arab guests, according to one employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", left out his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s country code list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it sparked even more anger in the director.
“The majority of our guests are Arab and they have demanded that the code be deleted,” Lanzmann said.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called this a “great shame,” reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were appalled and appalled by this event.
This is really embarrassing.
The fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more shameful.
There is no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to “draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident sparked a pretty big response on the internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some asserted that the Kempinski Hotel had “donated” to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," another post said, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all allegations and called the incident a “mistake” and “apologized” to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There has never been a direct order not to put Israel on the quick-election list," a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel quoted the Süddeutsche Zeitung as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest against the government’s reforms to the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
Difficulties began as police officers tried to push the students apart, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the state governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be deployed to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests came a few days after mass protesters took to the streets to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed by a Senate vote to remove her from office.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has grown sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran rose by 91.5%, amounting to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Office issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are being broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses wanted: Beverage market invaded in Waldbröl
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL beverage market on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
With the support of a gun, three dark-dressed people who had mummified their faces demanded the release of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
The amount of money that was taken is not disclosed by the police.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market can be accessed directly from the Rewe Market’s parking deck and is poorly viewable.
The perpetrators must have run in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg after the raid and escaped from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking garage entrance with the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who made observations related to the robbery at the time of the crime (around 7.45 p.m.) should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Play and Fun in Summer Leisure
The children and young people of the social pedagogical day group / social group work of the Nagold Children's Protection Federation spent eight beautiful and happy days with their caregivers on their summer break in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located leisure home Hardtwäldle, the life-enjoying group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand, we went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guided tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third excursion led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On hot days, the group had fun at the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and squirt.
Culinary, children and caregivers were spoiled with their self-prepared body foods such as the sour Spätzle, the Seebronn Pännle, the Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and the Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful pieces of jewellery were created from pearls and stones or made from wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Colorful Evening".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned happily home.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time to the next Rome pilgrimage of all ministers in two years, the St. Anna Senior Ministers’ Round has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided on the bishop’s city of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the Gate of Mercy opened for this purpose at the Freiburg Monastery.
16 minis from Bitterbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Holy Rooms made their way.
The evening before, the pastor Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessing the pilgrim crosses and giving the pilgrims blessings.
From Horb we took the train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage route was started from the Münster.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.
But even on the way, the minis repeatedly rested at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim songbook.
For the overnight stays were available parish homes of the local parishes.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast at the stages.
On the second day we went via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day we started the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, because in the muddy heat had to be first descended about 500 meters altitude and then climbed again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived at the Freiburger Münster in the afternoon and walked through the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, we thanked God.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination by cooperator Markus Obert were welcomed.
After the service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scottish Callum Skinner storms home as Briton wins gold for cycling
Scotland’s Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men’s sprint in Rio Velodrome when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchoring role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The young pound made the legend proud when he rushed home to win a victory of the favorites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place at the World Railway Championships in London in March despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as hinds appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes lagged shortly after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A strategy change made up a large part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he intentionally fell on the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a great victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the stand."
We have come together as a team for the last three months.
We got away with so many world titles so badly that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that expects us successful five days in velodrome.
With the form of Kenny, it is in the area of possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; that day were also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same as today.
Kenny next takes part in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to knighthood."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived in 3:51,942.
The world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had argued with officials before qualifying yesterday, when officials called him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time at 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-terms of the Olympics and scoop a bunch of medals.
After a truly extraordinary depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down.
Dramas were set in the background, such as the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, as well as the retirement of such greats as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland smelter questioned due to repeal of energy contract
The future of Portland’s aluminum melt in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and cancels all supply contracts, the energy supplier said.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa’s Portland facility are at stake.
No fewer than 2,000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of a closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the smelting plant consumes around 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa smelter in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price of the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority-owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
“AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity from the smelter,” the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts are so-called "back-up transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential effects on revenues on AGL from FY 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong wholesale electricity futures markets.
AGL announced that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its annual closing of $187 million in “anticipation of termination”.
Alcoa said the decision to cancel the contracts did not affect “the ability of Alcoas to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant.”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even though it still owes a statement on why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts warn of the potential closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to poor economic conditions in the industry.
Referring to the analysts’ statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts per year and Tomago consumes around 900 megawatts per year.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And for us as a generator, that would not be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder who ran at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the Rob and Caitlyn issues, as well as in the presence of the all-popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest, who have forgotten the cover of a classical one with their sister), and the other.
That’s the cliché-filled storyline of almost every birthday episode of a children’s show (Seacrest put the phrase, “You thought we forgot you?”, with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit at a broadcasting venue at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With the September issue of Vogue in mind, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her when it comes to the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in its own right.
The September edition is Vogue's best-selling edition of the year.
With a volume that resembles a picture book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages were advertised from the 832 pages of the Walzer).
The revelation of his cover star is expected so long that in the last two years images of the magazine leaked even before the official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more " celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the small chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good snapchat video (even if all of that applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner’s success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on discouragement seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
In the truest sense of the word, she is a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your primer by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Community Law Centers reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country’s most in need of assistance are dismissed annually by the community law centres, while the industry looks at the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly older people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unfair deportations and the like – have already been denied free legal advice and legal counsel when seeking it.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively burdened, are prepared for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
Queesland Community Law Centers Director James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centers found that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a lifting of the Federal Government’s decision.
“Queensland’s community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being rejected from important services you need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and overwhelming debts, families going through separations, workers unjustly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need with legal issues.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community law centres and their client communities, as well as that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign accused of allegedly pulling gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun at an employee while they were riding in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months that the matter would be settled internally before realizing that “this would not happen.”
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "draw a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run into Vincent's knee," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
“We don’t have to fire guns to do damage,” Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment People” — gun owners and gun friends — should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were to be elected and appoint judges.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini’s complaint demands damages from the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and lasting mental damages.
Trump's press spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, was unable to reach a comment.
Attempts to contact Philip failed as well.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The proceeding is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.
This was revealed by representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild"-Zeitung (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to serve as the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party would be just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), while the AfD would be represented in the parliament for the first time with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens rejoined the Schwerin Landtag with 6% (previously 8.7%).
The NDP and the FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
According to the poll, the SPD would only be 23 percent in the Berlin House election (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It would still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would miss out in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The First Smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in the hand.
On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow date back to the Stone Age of the Internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "office in the format of western pockets".
In fact, the new mobile phone could reach a lot for the standards at the time: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-mark, that is, about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have imagined in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, but not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile phone business experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.
The market is dominated by vendors, who all came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is everyday life for many people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, with Samsung and Apple accounting for 555 million units alone.
Worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there are the well-running businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone, a whole industry has emerged.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market did not come until early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at the Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all easy to use via a touch screen.
Apple’s winning move began, and today the iPhone is the company’s most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the downside.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors such as Samsung are now leading the way.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
“We all have to learn to put away the smartphone,” said Janina Kugel, head of the Siemens Board of Personnel.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must steer Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but across the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just as it was in London in 2012, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the Heathrow enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong at Heathrow too.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth, and a legacy of skills and employment across the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, built in the midst of the world's two busiest catwalks.
Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, backed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a huge success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It’s time we steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blocking are like a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus posted a blog post stating that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding for its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of round-the-close fight between the ad-blocking open source community and the bypass has been going on since ad blockers were invented,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; nearly four times as many in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook from their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its “ad preference tool” to give people more control over ads targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a dull tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people’s hands.
Woman in alleged suicide driven over Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police call witnesses after a woman was hit in the early morning hours on Thursday in a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, urging them and each witness to the incident to report.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen if one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision preventable?
This is something that the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases – in which a person ran in the dark on the highway – it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian would run on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after overtaking and killing a man who was on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and fell unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident near Morges on Thursday should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine if Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere, could have had Earth-like conditions once.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly continued to spin.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to harbor life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side of the Sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than Earth’s today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus—over the course of several billion years—was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letter.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as the Colorado Avalanche’s coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday, leading too little co-determination in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorado’s alternate president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
I’ve been thinking a lot and a lot over the course of the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it needs it, and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.
He must also have the right to participate in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches, Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the offseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, put on strike
Work struggles over pay for North Sea oil workers are being suspended as all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute,” it said in a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day sessions in the coming weeks, which will begin early next year, to re-enact the issues.
The unions said their last strike, the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts will give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell has fired thousands of people and announced plans to quit its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its business as a result of its mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was compounded by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea, compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational rate of stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at varying rates and how rotational periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, which formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They are spinning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars spin slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower pirouets than smaller ones.
"In the ballet of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about, how, when and why stars slow their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
Controversial baseball star resigns
Alex Rodriguez’s tears ran faster than the U.S. baseball star in his best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old pro will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
“I love this game and this team.
"I say goodbye to both," said the 14-time all-star Major League Baseball (MLB) player.
Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player of the league three times, winning the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signature under a ten-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back with performance for a long time.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams (“Runs”) for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and since 2005 the Yankees, he has achieved some milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old will not be admitted to the baseball hall of fame.
Because as successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the court.
Already in 2009, the superstar at ESPN admitted to taking banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was banned for 211 games due to an involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is regarded as the main suspect of having received performance-enhancing drugs for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014, because I played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said.
Even his farewell days are not silent.
While many baseball legends regained the stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
“My job involves trying to win every game,” Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and who is reportedly having relationships with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy rallies from fans of Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Getting caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An athlete nearly won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official cases of doping became known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3,000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - just before the start of the already critically-eyed athletics competitions, this news comes at the moment.
Chen had already been detected last Sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in the preliminaries over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-sample and hold a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and calls on Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations," Xinhua said in a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible, but the CAS, for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio leaked the news of the positive test at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she told Bulgarian television station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athlete said.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova has been temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample is already positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borisov immediately criticized the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doped nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, like his brother Tomasz.
Both contest the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, especially the case of Danekova is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF had banned the start of the entire Russian team except for one exception due to systematic doping, also the Kenya runners produces many bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, the previous offences in China had also caused fierce clashes between the athletes.
Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pisselt purple."
"If I see the podium over 200m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the center of a fight with Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters,” he said.
Sun had been tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to hold a three-month lockdown.
Data theft: How perfidious hackers blackmail their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the past twelve months have been at least once, in some cases victims of an attack using blackmail software.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies have been targeted for ransomware extortion.
Forty percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators to be able to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize in their extortion software, according to the observations of Malwarebytes mounting attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the ransom potentially to be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
“We are currently seeing a terrifyingly rapid evolution of malware,” said Marcin Kleczynski, head of Malwarebytes.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks took place terrifyingly quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it specifically searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, victims must transfer money – usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware hits.
22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses through ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt their business completely, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
“We always tell the victims: don’t pay, you only promote the problem,” Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators’ demand in view of the standstill in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to earn more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos explains: “A single person can write a ransomware about within a week.”
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software builder to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
“The package includes a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed,” says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for other hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in to one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
“Usually, the criminals then commission spammers to spread it,” Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that are better at backing up their data.
More than 50 percent of enterprise IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that they can prevent ransomware through file backups and scanning software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat for successful detection, the perpetrators threaten instead to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is still many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new targets in the Internet of Things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, unlocking such a blocked heater could be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the front row and in the rear, it does not seem narrow anywhere.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top drops out a bit.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage space.
There is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l for elevated and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back seat can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-litre diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
But he should do his job a little quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The direction should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top version "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to speed 32), the Collision Warning System and the Track Keeping Assist.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it assesses many obstacles as "nearing objects" when maneuvering.
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic signal recognition and reduces speed when needed.
Full connectivity is only available for top-of-the-line equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to achieve.
The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you do not want to invest so much, you will get the petrol from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
A liability is only conceivable in the event of risks typical of air transport, argued the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneepad in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere — it was a general life risk, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay compensation to the man.
Sickness case: When the organizer pays
Sick holidaymakers will only receive money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly to be found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have been shown to have the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was severely ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkey vacation.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which allegedly polluted the sea water.
The family felt that the trip had been deficient - and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in court.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiff’s departure.
Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was fine.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
Especially since no impurities were found in the water samples.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly through contagion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must respond resolutely and resolutely to terrorist threats at the same time.
Our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If perpetrators are forced to leave the country faster, it increases security and also strengthens the public’s support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further reinforcement of the security forces, "on a medium four-digit scale over several years."
Promoting sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, the gun law is to be novelized in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The last much discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors is to be respected, according to de Maizières.
However, he wants to find solutions in dialogue with the medical community, how to reduce the threat to citizens, he said, for example, with a view to mental disorders.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (darknet), de Maizière plans to use covert investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: “The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security.”
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against actionism.
“That was a slap in the ears for the sharpsmiths in the CDU/CSU,” Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
A general ban on complete concealment is problematic under constitutional law.
You can't forbid anything you refuse, and I refuse wearing the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate action with ever new anti-terrorism packages.
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotte sayings and a tightening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It accumulates regularly on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
But this is to be changed: the right turning track is to be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in a traffic jam on the surrounding road every night when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (August 16-17) the state-owned road construction company extends the right-hand turning track by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit.
Drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Straße to the right.
The big advantage is that traffic splits up earlier, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district representative Münster-West.
The narrowing of the road on the feeder annoys the drivers especially between 5 and 7 pm.
On working days, the backlog extends up to the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle hole on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is steered only one lane over the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt almost three-quarters of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to accommodate heavy-duty traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated workday congestion will last cannot be said by the responsible national company.
However, years can be expected: because the bridge has an official residual useful life until 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand turning track, the state company deliberately chose the weaker time in the school holidays, because handicaps are to be expected.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, traffic will pass the construction site in a single lane.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offerings for Schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The club Nima's and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's allows young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a presentation of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students between the ages of eleven and 15 attended the staging in the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most of the young people in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations they were able to follow the course of the action nevertheless, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theater project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee and migrant background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatrical play and theatrical language training are in the planning.
The project “Intercultural Journey” continues.
Given the increased refugee numbers, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of falling stars: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-shooting-lookers in the southwest of Germany on the night of Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope.
Due to clouds and rain, the night was poorly suited to observe the sky spectacle, said the chairman of the Welzheim observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will certainly see many shooting stars in the sky.
The star sheds are Perseids, which at 216,000 kilometers per hour are among the fastest shoots of stars.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can not think of sleep before the alarm clock.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep problems and more than ten percent often or permanently feel that their sleep is not recoverable.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances appear?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
However, what is commonly understood is insomnia, i.e. a sleeping disorder.
Many people feel that sleeping through is unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of the German Association of House Doctors with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications.
Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is common, especially with depression," Weeß says.
And it may be that various factors depend on each other.
If, for example, you have a herniated disc, you can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and perhaps start to ponder everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep problems?
Whoever does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired in the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can look quite different: you are tired, tired, unsleeping, have difficulty with attention and concentration, are easily irritable, have mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches.
To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Among other treatment options are behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any established sleep physicians in Germany, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, if you have sleep problems, you should first contact the family doctor, Weeß advises.
He can clarify by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, in cases of snoring with respirators, in cases of sick daytime fatigue, in cases of sleep walkers or if the cause of a sleep disorder is not found, Fietze explains.
You don’t really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day as normal.
“Please don’t just get noon sleep,” Fietze says.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get the problems under control?
There are quite a few set screws that you can use for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleeping and waking times, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping in the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken via Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the short-haul world championships in Doha, setting his first world record at the same time.
Former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now made his way through Facebook to protect himself from his ex-teammates who are being criticized.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets €20,000 and a jungle king €150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page.
The promotion system in swimming sports is bad, on the other hand, the doping controls are very good.
This does not allow us to compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic of doping or even do so.
“I’m not saying that checks should be stopped here,” he continued.
If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start to the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
The same should be done with countries as well.
“Whoever cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controllers before the World Cup/OS for a certain time is not allowed to participate,” demands the Election Hamburger, who now operates an ice cream parlour.
Airport: Gang of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport
Dusseldorf police officers arrested two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts as a gang.
At around 9.30 p.m., civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang known to police officers from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and had acted jointly, partly and particularly professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissioner’s Office 34 can prove four acts against thieves who had entered Germany specifically for the purpose of committing crimes.
In total, they took more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few lime trees, in the meantime still a remnant of cobblestones: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first glance, but the police count it as one of the "Dangerous Places" of the city.
Walking along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and an organic shop.
On the facade of a grey house someone sprayed "ugly!"
Opposite a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, is already being built: By 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, have been preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: it was once occupied, now the residents have leases, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Henkel, the Berlin senator of the interior, has repeatedly advocated a tough action by the police against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On June 22, after the ground floor rooms, the forges, with 300 police officers, had been cleared, police patrolled for three weeks according to official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site, blocking parts of the road and preventing visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew to the cheer of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others chat late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many locals: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn’t sound like a neighborhood that mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The trench that the Berlin Senator and the police open between house occupiers and their neighbors apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city today.
House occupancy and the resulting residential projects have also been part of the district for a long time: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz street very close to the Riga river.
While Mainz had been cleared under a large police command in a real street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited today by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world: residents from the GDR and former occupiers of houses now share their neighbourhood with them.
This is also evident in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent for new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols of this development: they can be recognized by thrown in discs or freshly painted facades, which have been thrown in with color bags.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words “left-wing autonomous violence”.
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as personal injury are almost exclusively directed at police officers, according to statistics.
Most of the crimes involve property damage, which tends to affect new buildings and newly renovated homes.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no mention of uncertainty.
When it comes to violence, it is appeasing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly weren’t.
Even the famous burning cars have not existed directly in the Rigaer for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the Riga street - and stayed.
That is why it was so important to her that the locals got their streets back: from the police, the politicians and the media, who all suddenly claimed the sovereignty of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street is still taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that displace the old inhabitants.
"These are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well smoked," she says.
"Violence and destruction can absolutely not be approved."
But what should you do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for grown-ups who are annoyed by color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood.
Whoever moves out should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub neighborhood can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle becomes new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team led by Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as a contact point for all actors: refugees, the working group for refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine Kunde from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying wool milk sauce, which has a problem above all else.
For example, some - less ridiculous than targeting the multitude of desired tasks - had meant when the administration wanted to advertise the position.
An administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought, just an egg-laying wool milk sauce.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has limited a 50% position to three years.
“It was high time,” says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
New containers are coming soon in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the refugee followers that have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for connecting accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living spaces.
The cost of the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility shifts from Landratsamt to Kommune and Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private homes.
It does not work so far, relying on private homes, says Deuschle.
Therefore, communal apartments must be used, as it is so beautifully called.
So new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.
But it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the key word, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and outreach activities for refugees and migrants, which need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Customer.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers do charitable work - and that is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
This is not “employment therapy.”
But activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So administration and volunteers also jump in here.
It is central that the refugees feel that they are desired and welcomed in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, cannot work and is useless, will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problems, customer honestly says, "People who can't do anything at all". The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
It’s all a “mammoth task.”
A difficult question: after recent events, are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "which some may call naive, but a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it.
The helpers are already aware.
These incidents are also an issue for refugees.
They were afraid that the assassins would completely discredit them.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, volunteers must look for activities on the ground and in the region.
They always have in mind that a new push of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, politicians are afraid.
Actually, it is unfair to put them helpers in place.
"We have not yet arrived in Urbach where we wanted to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already burdened with integrating the people of the past reasonably.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Thieves wanted with helicopter
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessful.
