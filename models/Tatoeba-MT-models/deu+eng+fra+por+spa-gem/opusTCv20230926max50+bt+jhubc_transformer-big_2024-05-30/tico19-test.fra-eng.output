Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus cases (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a peak of COVID-19 patients in need of care, and in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been dubbed coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, about 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild condition, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which heal.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 leads to a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a severe form of the disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution of the Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of that country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between December 31, 2019 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as the ministries of health, national and regional health authorities of the different countries, as well as WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the development of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare it with the experience of Italy.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom for the period from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. with data from Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before experiencing a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This trend was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom reported a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of March 15 at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is rapidly increasing within the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the fact that countries are at different stages and there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions as well as differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation purposes, including for catch-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy indicated that about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care are currently available across the EU/EEA for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not presented).
However, systematic collection is needed to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds per 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios related to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a risk of 90% overcapacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment COVID-19.
Given that cases were previously grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and that hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, data on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be compiled at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units (NUTS 2).
Italy’s experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of care, and in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by ECDC's recent rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2 from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not leave enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window during which each country will be able to step up its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Otherwise, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a spike in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far led to more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and it affects older people more than younger people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article strives to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this booming research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still await answers, we hope that this review will contribute to a better understanding and eradication of this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, January 25, 2020, marked forever the Chinese, who were forced to remain cloistered for the duration of the golden week as well as for long other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003; that is why it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan and quickly spread to all of China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For the WHO, COVID-19 is “the number one public enemy,” potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works on COVID-19 have been published, including in the fields of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, several patients presenting the sequence of the virus, isolated from
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this growing new topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and we will address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, during this century, we have experienced two highly human-pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before rapidly spreading to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recent history.
As shown in Fig.1,1, outbreaks of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission in Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was unveiled.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic had spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was quarantined with interruption of all public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO called the epidemic a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread to all of China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but more predominantly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was developing in homes, mainly in Hubei Province and on the outskirts.
The average duration between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, coinciding with the massive displacements that took place prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5> 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a single strand RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the alpha and beta genera.
The glycoprotein Spike (S) of the envelope binds to the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken from the site of origin of the epidemic, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium in the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein S binds to human ACE2 less strongly than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a lesser infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b as well as a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain known domains or functional patterns.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of complete human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, which provides indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from bats and were transmitted to humans via civets and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission pathway is yet to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would imply homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study by researchers in Guangzhou, China, the pangolin - a long-nose mammal feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by the 99% genetic homology between a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% between two genomes constitutes a difference of importance; therefore, conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20°C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may very well have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally devoid of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), in particular type C lectin receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I type receptors (RLRs).
The virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV protein N may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate the infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in order to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit T-cell functions by inducing apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, to multi-visceral failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by outbreaks, is more likely to affect older adults with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is widely accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective duration of the quarantine according to the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia within one week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest x-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus in order to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnea and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilatory assistance.
Similar conclusions have been reported by two recent studies on a family and a outbreak that occurred following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with a higher lethality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
Regarding SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20%-25%), and sore throat (13%-25%), and ventilatory assistance was needed for approximately 14 to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, for 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2-4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The data above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak than it was for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a rally or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals can be carriers of the virus for more than two weeks without presenting symptoms and that recovered patients can be carriers of the virus again, which underlines the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with 4 <0xC3><0x97> 109/L white blood cell count and 1 <0xC3><0x97> 109/L lymphocyte count, as well as high aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were identified in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a degradation product of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Chest X-ray abnormalities were observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral uneven shadows or frosted glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in the level of surfactant and an increase in surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying chest exams often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinuclear syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of the viral infection of the SRA and SRA patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which then no longer relied solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which makes it possible to identify synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L and 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L reaid less than a sample d'reaid in 10-100 d's per microlitre.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens proves conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can only provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine as well as psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients has been proposed for treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks primarily the lungs initially and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Respiratory assistance is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECM), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune system reaction has been established to cause cytokine shock in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3> and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shocks include modulation of the immune response by T cells, blockage of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokine reporting suppressor 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, taking high-dose steroids did not have beneficial effects on severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they would lead to serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
Nevertheless, prudent use of short low-to-moderate corticosteroid cycles has been recommended for patients with severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of writing of this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and production of antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease is an ancient practice.
In fact, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had cured COVID-19 and injected to 10 severely affected patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, associated with a decrease in the phenomenon of inflammation, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
Moreover, given the therapeutic effects, certain drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine-release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the need for plasma to treat severely ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to identify the genetic codes encoding the relevant antibodies or to look for effective antibodies against the major proteins of the virus.
This would increase the production of antibodies rapidly.
TCM has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on combining multiple components into a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis, posed according to the theories of TCM.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a severe form of the disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been shown to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest cure rates for COVID-19 were observed in the provinces of China that used TCM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7%), Ningxia Region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used only 30% of patients with COVID-19, had the lowest cure rate (13% of patients with COVID-19).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing a treatment using Western Medicine alone (MO) and a combination treatment combining MO and TCM.
It was found that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to go away from symptoms and the length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM remains to be clarified through controlled trials conducted on a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel a strong concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those in quarantine also experience a sense of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of the infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion, and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory search for contacts and quarantine, as part of the public health services response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt among patients with regard to the effects of contagion, quarantine, and the stigma of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care must be provided to COVID-19 patients, individuals identified as probable cases, people in contact with these populations, as well as to any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal reservoirs and humans to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce potent long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and in models subject to lethal provocation as well as their protection against zoonotic virus infection remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS went extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and critical objective in order to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the significant delay (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution across thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a forecasting model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies to date, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients are as follows (Table (Table33):
Age: Age was the main factor in SARS prognosis, and this also appears to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% over 50 years of age according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to hepatic dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been advanced as a potential prognostic factor of disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between CRP and severity and COVID-19 prognosis was also proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also participate in establishing the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in case of tissue damage.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Thoracic X-ray results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other factors for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid Use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in supplemental treatment for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose corticosteroid intake has been widely used for severe SARS cases, many survivors have experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, steroid administration to COVID-19 patients should be limited to a low dose and short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to a normal life.
According to the demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause or cause few symptoms in the first phase of infection, as did the coronaviruses that cause common colds.
As a result, newly infected or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 outbreak is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
Significant efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of nearly the entire population to halt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decay phase will last 3-4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not go off in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the mid-nasal cornet and throat samples of recovered patients 2 weeks after they were discharged from hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual decline in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to initial forecasts, the Ebola virus was expected to result in up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, thanks to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally put under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectiousness and eventually dies out or evolves into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing, and also possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stool, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Precautionary measures should be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even anyone likely to be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) contributes to controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent potentially infected droplets from being sprayed or deposited on surfaces, where they could be passed on to other people.
However, only N95 masks (1860) provide protection against virion inhalation from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, since both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to pass through five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, it is imperative that healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals must wear adjusted insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor found himself infected with SARS-CoV-2 even while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have penetrated his body through the eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear clear visors or protective glasses in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfecting soap more often than usual, to stay confined to the maximum and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one meter with the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have put China on high alert after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population that the new virus was low-contagious, had limited interhuman communicability and would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a noticeable relaxation, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies must learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and can affect the behavior and decisions of the population; (2) show more sensitivity and reactivity to the unusual data of clinics rather than expecting formal reports from doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic and try to achieve the population's response to its early stages; (4) to improve the population's response and to the unusual data of clinics rather than to wait for formal reports from doctors or official bodies; (3) to be more restricted to be more restricted; (3) to be more restricted;
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it has spread to all of China as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also similar to those of SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak is born as an impression of déj<0xC3><0xA0> vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mainly transmitted by severely ill patients, so it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing may be negative for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may again be positive for the virus.
This greatly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain pending, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiroptera.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the original host, e.g. bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a fast and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or reappear regularly like the flu?
It is essential, although it may take time, to get answers to all of these questions as well as many others.
However, no matter what expenses this has to entail, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
In addition to supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could approximately produce two secondary cases with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, with the peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, improper liver function tests and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in case of suspicion of SARS.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokine shock, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present all over the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present globally, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and sustain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and long-term diffusion after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community HCoVs causing moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to occur, HCoVs must replicate in humans in a proportion sufficient to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
In this context, the more the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the greater the number of people infected, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired VOCs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is not sustainable.
They must maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it is home to a near ascendant sharing a high homology at the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often adapted well and is non-pathogenic to its host.
In the same way, a reservoir host houses the HCoV continuously and in the long term.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, given that 80% of the animals on the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate amplifier hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
This is why bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies conducted in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are HIV-positive to specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, as well as camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the airways, but also through feces, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even less than that separating beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could be derived from bat CoV, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat Vo, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of the bat close to HCoV-229E have been found.
First, unlike alpaca, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Then, the alpha-CoV of the bat related to HCoV-229E is numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV in alpaca caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
In reality, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while bat alpha-CoVs serve as the genetic reservoir of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of cross-species transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known through its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels who have gone from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities of interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through slicing or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by slicing and consuming game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, estimated VOC mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the VOC adaptation phase to new hosts.
Nevertheless, the rates of VOC mutation are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the VOCs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher human adaptation rate.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to render SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals ineffective in the short term.
Third, VoCs randomly and frequently change models when replicating RNA through a unique "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for VOCs observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
Beyond these three viral factors indicated above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing cross-species transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been impaired.
Indeed, a study by electron cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity of this bond 10 to 20 times higher than that observed between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely enough, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural HCoV reservoir hosts, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute a barrier to cross-species transmission.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to the starting point
The diversity of bat VOCs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat VOCs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but encoded divergent ORF8 proteins.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is presumed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the MERS-CoV outbreak has experienced recombinant episodes between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
While ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, causing a reading frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with VOCs, indicating mutual adaptation between VOCs and bats.
It seemed that bats had adapted well to VOC from the anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RODs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress VOC replication and affect "relection" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new cell.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
VOCs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong host immune response.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of interferon type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is deficient in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Remarkably SARS-CoV-2-like pangolin beta-CoVs have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
VOCs have returned under the ramp lights due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in the wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurring MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, coupled with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic VOCs circulate in the wild.
In particular, VOCs of bats, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion arises.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonose reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 parental virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Whether bats, pangolins or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or quasi-identical parental viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals, which can be harmful or cause disease.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate during home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, killing nearly 1.8 million people each year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia lead to the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by flaky skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Over-frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily tooth brushing with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter in the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of antiseptics or recommended disinfectants targets organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) which are used to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, which has an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, extracts of plants).
The warm water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have found that the use of warm water did not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or with a humectant such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively remove germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against viruses of the type norovirus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid removal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper handwashing unless you do not have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can lead to skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydroalcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since the latter remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers depends heavily on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly inferior to that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have exhibited durable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of the stagnant water points, while the temperature of the water does not seem to make any difference).
Foam a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water basin can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands recontamine more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and scaly nail polish can host microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or other soap solutions are not available. For example, pouring water from a suspended and pierced can or keg and/or using ash if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or schools), there are many alternatives.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a pitcher suspended using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is debated.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilet.
After hand washing and hand drying with hot air, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the finger pulp and 254% on the palms.
Air-jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp of 42% and on the palms of 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that make reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical handwashing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
The purpose of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and prevent their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
During rinsing, it should be avoided that water on the forearms flows to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits of increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, faucets are rarely found to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates can also be attributed to stubborn habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations may be part of the hand hygiene campaigns that are carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an outreach campaign that claims to encourage changing behaviours. Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, a review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetid odors called miasmes.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating “good handwashing techniques” were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The term "washing your hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or be an accomplice to something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had these kinds of thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory “purification” measures, such as volunteering.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash their hands before and after each meal.

It should also be pointed out that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in the genomes of viruses, which most likely result from pressures exerted during selection, in particular by the host's immune system.
Examples include the loss of complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, causing a reading frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with VOCs, indicating mutual adaptation between VOCs and bats.
It seemed that bats had adapted well to VOC from the anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting the natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of the molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RODs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress VOC replication and affect "relection" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new cell.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
VOCs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong host immune response.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.

In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the administration of interferon type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is deficient in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other commercially available animals were found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 were identified.
Remarkably SARS-CoV-2-like pangolin beta-CoVs have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, either voluntarily or accidentally.
VOCs have returned under the ramp lights due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of VOCs in bats and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role that zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs play in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Numerous evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and civets on the market, the closure of fresh produce markets and the slaughter of civets there could have effectively ended the SARS outbreak.
According to the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh produce markets to avoid zoonosis transmission, given the discovery of numerous pangolin beta-CoV lines closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs will remain to be determined in subsequent studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in the wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurring MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, coupled with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic VOCs circulate in the wild.
In particular, VOCs of bats, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There are plenty of opportunities for these zoonotic VOCs to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or fatal VOCs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion arises.
Although bats have many characteristics favorable to the spread of viruses, the likelihood for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are made aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonose reservoirs.
All the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 parental virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, especially domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether bats, pangolins or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or quasi-identical parental viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of diagnostic criteria for “suspect cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team issued a Rapid Recommendation Directive for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this Directive outlined our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic globally.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge is gradually advancing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a “suspect case” and a “confirmed case” according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak that now officially bears the name coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO called COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge is slowly advancing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) had seven editions in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which had been substantially changed.
Since our directive received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Trial Seventh Version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case must associate one of the features of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
epidemiological history of fever: (1) a history of travel or residency of fever in the city of Wuhan, and in the neighbouring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids)
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts at the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 specific phase; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with the known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for SAG-IgM and SARS-CoV IgG antibody ratio or IgG-GT positive increase;
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or in blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth edition (February 8, 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes build on the continued work of the researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for early diagnosis, as well as airway samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the positive antibody specific result in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us to caution regarding atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated given that they categorized people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system should also be reviewed in clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to provide their feedback.
Regarding the diagnosis of “suspected cases” and “confirmed cases”, we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to offer its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new COVID-19-related deaths, a daily record
Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19-related deaths in a single day.
The country recorded a record number of deaths due to the virus in just one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected people recorded included 114 active cases and 33 cured people, who remained confined to homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on March 26 and was due to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always permitted.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the confinement of the city until May 1.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially life-threatening a HCoV infection could be.
Most HCoVs come from bats in which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also lead to a better understanding of CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The Beta-CoV genus contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
To date, seven human VOCs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of crossing the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier host(s), with important implications for the prevention of future contagion.
Animal VOCs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in lung cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the classic cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough seen in 10-20% of cases.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are present all over the world and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in temperate climate countries.
Australian stores reduce limits on toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on buying toilet paper to two and one package per purchase at all stores nationwide, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a packet limit.
These limits have been posted in the form of messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently amassed reserves for fear of COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted purchases of toilet paper for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, said that with the restriction of four packages in place, “many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery,” and called the request “unprecedented,” while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it “unexpected.”
Sales saw a "slight increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the allowed quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an additional inventory, while ALDI made inventory available earlier for a promotion scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but local council restrictions on truck deliveries make it difficult.
It predicts higher production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of inventory, some stores are unable to honor the Wednesday promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in inventories of a small quantity that, once exhausted, leave large empty spaces on shelves, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the shelves are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, it will likely reduce panic,” Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday it was out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent paper, said they are working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate website, said some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers were on leave during the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page inlay intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday evening that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization calls COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the current outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) a pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, not to the danger of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to push governments to action:
“All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries monitor, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“We are deeply concerned not only about the alarming levels of spread and severity, but also about the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said, in comments published by CNN in February, that “aside from the flu, no other respiratory virus has been observed from its onset until it continues to spread globally.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, stating that “we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”
He added, “and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO’s decision in January to declare the epidemic a public health emergency of international significance.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “To make it short, the situation will get worse.”
On Thursday, the Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronavirus disease outbreak since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international significance on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people have been healed.
The lethality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral therapy.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by introducing travel restrictions, quarantine, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic disturbances, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world’s student population.
False information about the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, as well as against others from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to decreased travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported an outbreak of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and it is therefore believed that the virus is of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely linked to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first known person with symptoms had become ill on December 1, 2019, and this person had no clear link to the market.
Of the cases of the first outbreak reported in December 2019, two-thirds proved to have a link with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could go back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases appeared to decline in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
On February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young people, those aged 19 and under representing 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK Chief Scientific Advisor Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population must be infected before they can achieve effective collective immunity.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, up to January 23, 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection in 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of baseline reproductive rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are cured.
For those who do not heal, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80 per cent of deaths were for those over 60, and 75 per cent had pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official COVID-19 pandemic death counts generally refer to those who have been tested positive for COVID under official protocols.
The actual number of COVID-19 victims could be much higher, as it might not include untested deceased people - e.g. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveals that surmortality figures during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death count.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged “We know [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated,” a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of underestimation in the U.S. Such an underestimation often occurs during pandemics, as confirmed by the January 9th outbreak of swine flu H1N1.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time elapsed since the onset of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global case-to-death ratio is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, case-to-death ratio estimates decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms that appeared between January 1 and 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that appeared after February 1, 2020). Other indicators are the mortality rate (lethality rates), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who succumb to a disease, and the percentage of people who succumb to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have attempted to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value in this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the tests on estimates of the mortality rate.
The WHO argues that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: “Uncontrolled, infectious outbreaks usually stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease becomes short of available hosts.
But it’s almost impossible to make any relevant predictions at the moment of when this will happen.”
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said “this could be done by June” if all countries succeed in mobilizing to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two.”
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary “until a vaccine is available (possibly in 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus—because it’s very easily transmitted—will completely disappear” and that it “could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to recur every year.”
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite unspecific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO says that about one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies emergency symptoms such as persistent breathing difficulty, pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakening, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these respiratory symptoms are present. Severe septic shock, severe septic and syndrome can lead to severe pneumonia.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results confirming the infection, so the researchers issued recommendations that people who had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is more often five days. An example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly through close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing unprotected can throw droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by thin droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected by talking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected during exhalation, including speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Postillons can land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore lead to aerial spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it could be transmitted through the stool, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases have been reported, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, a person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives for hours or even days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however British authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, such as after being in contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease foci.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in coronaviruses related in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B-line) associated with two bat strains.
It is 96% identical to the entire genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RatTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in parts of the genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and those from humans.
Comparing the entire genome has so far revealed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however the final confirmation is done by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the infected secretions or scanner.
A study comparing PCR and the scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that “the scanner should not be used to screen or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The WHO has released several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a rhinopharyngeal sample but a throat sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetric polished peripheral glass opacity and absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to the cross-section with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation is of limited accuracy for detecting COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of chest scans to PCR and showed that while imaging is less accurate for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its consideration as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neuron networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in imaging on both X-rays and scanners.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include having good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a trash bag.
Those who have already been infected were recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures were also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential travel to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spreading to communities, and some members of those communities do not know where or how they were infected. Health professionals who care for someone who could be infected are advised to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and wear protective glasses. Finding contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection.
Governments’ use of cell phone location data in this regard has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications were launched or offered on a volunteer basis, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing your nose and gurgling with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after they’ve been to the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after getting wet, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easily accessible.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a facility such as an office building or nursery, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or handkerchief when they cough or sneeze, and throw away any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by the projected postillons by talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions that explain where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene."
The WHO recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they care for a patient with COVID-19, even if it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people not touch their faces.
Several countries have begun encouraging their people to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical fabric masks. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially in case of proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask on public transport or in crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public exits without a mask or other means of covering his nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone protects themselves and protects others.
The Austrian government has ordered anyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March, imposed the wear of the mask on long-distance train and bus passengers on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any outing, while recommending the manufacture of an artisanal mask to those who cannot buy it.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by decreasing contact between people.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
The methods of social distancing can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, greeting each other without contact and keeping a physical distance from others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distancing in the regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum rallies recommended by U.S. government and health agencies were quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the public gatherings of more than two people. The older adults and those with underlying health problems in the "distant" physical "distant" organisms such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system have an increased risk of serious illness and complications. They were thus invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in the areas affected by the physical "distant" organisms.
The use of the term "social distancing" suggested that total social isolation should be used instead of encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or who does not have the symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in the affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
Individuals who have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very important were asked to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
The strategies for controlling an epidemic are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
The containment is put in place in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are shifting to the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Mitigation and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to curb the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproduction to less than 1. Part of managing an infectious disease epidemic is trying to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Among the non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic are personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public measures of social distancing such as the closure of schools and religious services; a public effort to encourage the acceptance of such interventions and participation in them; as well as environmental actions such as the cleaning of surfaces.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued alerts about the displacement of infected people.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected people who have been quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased production of masks and sanctioned the seizure of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (deceleration but not elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are overwhelmed.
Elimination may be preferred, but must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this occurs first), because otherwise, the transmission bounces quickly when the measurements are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including testing existing treatments.
Taking over-the-counter medications for colds or drinking and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can aggravate the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO said that some “traditional and artisanal remedies” can soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care facilities for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-urgent interventions where possible, separating and re-isolating the COVID-19 staff, and issuing positively from the COVID-19 staff.
There are various theories regarding the place of origin of the very first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are usually related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An outbreak of unknown cause pneumonia was observed on Dec. 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Province Hospital, which informed the 27th CDC, who in
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January, with the number of cases doubling about every seven and a half days in the early phases of the outbreak.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub as well as a major rail hub.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 healed.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted travel and put in place border controls.
National responses included curbing measures such as quarantine (also called orders to stay home, shelter or containment) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are subject to some form of containment in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, and about 59 million in Africa.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world experienced a form of confinement, with a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about one-third of the world’s population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case dates back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an outbreak of cases of unknown-cause pneumonia on December 26, which she reported to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan have received a warning for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no “manifest evidence” of transmission between human beings.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping as a “people’s war” to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as “the largest quarantine in human history,” a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was subsequently built: Leishenshan, to treat the additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as congress and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to curb the COVID-19 outbreak, including the issuance of health declarations for travellers and the extension of spring holiday holidays.
Universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have implemented a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport was altered and museums in China were temporarily closed.
The control of population displacement has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) had to deal with some form of displacement restriction. After the epidemic entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On March 23, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted inside the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveller returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases transmitted inside the country was essentially blocked, and that the epidemic was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the containment began. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for holders of a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, without specifying when this policy would end.
People wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and granted monetary stimulus plans to businesses. The State Affairs Council announced a day of mourning to begin with three minutes of silence on April 4 at 10 a.m., which coincides with the Qingming holiday.
It has been confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
The nation’s health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a rally in Daegu of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji’s followers who visited Daegu from Wuhan were suspected of being the cause of the outbreak.
On February 22, of the church’s 9,336 faithful, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, followed by 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers were tested positive for the virus.
South Korea has introduced what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to test the population for the virus, isolate all infected people and track and quarantine people who have been in contact with them.
Screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by international newcomers via a mobile app, virus screening drives delivering the results the next day, and increased testing capacity to enable testing of nearly 20,000 people each day.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the epidemic, although it has not quarantined entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.

A CNN report indicated that the combination of the large elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all people with the virus to date may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first appeared as one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has been criticized for its manifest lack of responsiveness and vivacity in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, discouraging all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work from home if possible and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all recreational facilities such as pubs and gyms should close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages, up to <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month, to avoid unemployment related to the crisis.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control, the U.S. government’s leading public health institute, announced that it had developed its own screening kit.
Despite this, the United States took time to start testing, which obscured the true extent of the epidemic at the time.
The tests were tainted by defective screening kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval for non-governmental screening kits (universities, businesses and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for being eligible for a test until early March (prescription by a mandatory doctor thereafter).
On February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.

Only South Africans whose test was negative were repatriated.
The test results exempted all South Africans, including crew members, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, who, as a precautionary measure, all remained under observation and quarantine for a period of 14 days at the Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the United States began partially withdrawing its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.

He subsequently sent 5,000 screening kits, 100,000 protective masks and 5 respirators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical equipment to Canada, with the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressing concerns about masks and screening kits manufactured in China.
For example, Spain removed 58,000 coronavirus screening kits made in China with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese protective masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks; they were thought to be from China, but they were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was welcomed in the regions of Latin America and Africa, and on 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the management and containment of the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of concealment that hindered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year."
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to enforce a travel ban in Wuhan, the WHO's representative Gauden Galea's in-and-out report stated that even though it was "certainly not a recommendation of the WHO", it was a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is the most concentrated" and he spoke of a "confirmation of the previous one".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said USPPI was due to “the risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said: “There is no reason for measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel.”
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to finance strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries that “do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it was about to appear.”
Tedros then stated that we were “as strong as our weakest link” and urged the international community to “invest today or pay more tomorrow.” On 11 February, the WHO established in a press conference that the disease was called COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to incorporate the “strength of the entire United Nations system into the response.”
A United Nations crisis management team has therefore been activated to coordinate the entire United Nations response, which according to WHO will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to bring their expertise to manage the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the epidemic.”
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by the WHO was activated in China to send "international experts and WHO on-the-spot" to China to support national management and to assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with major national institutions and conducting field visits with a view to assessing "the impact of response activities at the provincial level".
In response to the development of the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the global coronavirus threat had gone from “high” to “very high”, its highest level of alerting and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: “This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to stand ready,” adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan then indicated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that “we absolutely accept that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus.”
On March 11, the WHO said the coronavirus outbreak could be described as a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was “extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity as well as the alarming levels of inaction”.WHO faced significant criticism for its management of the pandemic, which was deemed inadequate, notably because of the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to hand over his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone was entitled to receive relief interventions and that this responsibility rested with the government.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
Experts stressed that each individual had the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are responsible for the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in different countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
Between policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy and responses to the effects of containment and travel restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge posed by the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for its management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CCP) have been removed from office following their management of the quarantine in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of policy makers to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some top Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the initial notion that the coronavirus outbreak had begun in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump called the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus,” declaring that in China “censorship has overpowered a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which was later labeled racism by some opponents and intended to “divert attention from its administration’s inability to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government outlining the outline of a communication strategy apparently coming from the National Security Council, whose strategy quoted is: “Everything comes from China.
We are being asked to try to communicate this message in every possible way, including at press conferences and television appearances.” News outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda push to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was “a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and “politics of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while a priori sending aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks donated by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own countries.
And other conflicts related to masks have also been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said: “Only China has responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous “high-ranking political source” who indicated that 80 percent of Russian aid was “little if not useful for Italy.”
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane charged with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering his help to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to give them back the same if necessary.”
The scale of NATO's planned "Defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO maneuver since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public health crisis, it puts not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries at risk, but also that of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate.”
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, stating that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic has prompted universal calls for the United States to adopt a social policy common to other rich countries, including a health care system.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan’s “ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts” after the latter announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for the indictment of Moon for the government's mismanagement of the epidemic or, on the contrary, praising his reaction. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to authorize Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to govern by decree until further notice, to suspend parliament and elections, and to punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and the government's management of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been accused of several cases of supply disruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the outbreak, panic purchases and a disruption of factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have resulted in the disappearance of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, shelves, resulting in shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has warned of delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100.
This demand has led to price increases of up to twenty times the normal price and has also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide and the WHO warns that this will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity for daigues to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the ensuing high demand for food products, both areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the severe food shortages that had been forecast in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural production, Northern Italy has not seen a significant decrease, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
The food shelves were only temporarily emptied, even in the city of Wuhan, as members of the Chinese government unlocked reserves of pork to provide adequate livelihoods for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
A negative impact on the global economy was felt in China: according to a March 16 media report, the Chinese economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the government’s measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 percent.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing hub, the viral epidemic has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain unstable until a clearer picture emerges on potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed that of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates an impact of more than $300 billion on the global supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have “wrapped” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to declining demand in China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 following a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.

All three indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the rating of China’s sovereign debt, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again due to fears related to the coronavirus, the biggest drop being seen on March 16.
Many believe that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures put in place by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than they did in the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public spaces, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled flights due to declining demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise industry has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festivities, and private companies have also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended New Year’s holidays until February 10, requiring most workplaces not to reopen before that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country’s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of infectious disease response and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store opening hours or temporary closures.
Visits to merchants in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders saw a 50-60% decline.
This also led to a 33% to 43% drop in pedestrian traffic in malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing cleaning frequencies, installing thermal scanners to control customers' temperatures, and cancelling events. According to an estimate from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave an additional 14 to 22 million people in relation to a situation of extreme poverty in Latin America without.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the some 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves stuck at home in inland provinces or stuck in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for help from the government.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million U.S. workers in 2020 and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) unemployed. The survey by the Angus Reid Institute has observed that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some type of unemploying.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies switched their employees to a government-subsidized partial activity scheme called Kurzarbeit.
The German scheme for part-time work compensation has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and independent, at the global level.
Arts and culture organizations have attempted to maintain their (often state-funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists wherever possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions around the world were closed until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced that the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place in the last week of the Christian Penance period of Lent, have been cancelled.
Many dioceses have advised older Christians to stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live or on television while others offer to practice their worship as a drive-in.
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels, and St. Peter's Square, which washed away all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian health minister announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the largest interruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.

The epidemic disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be “rescheduled beyond 2020, but by the summer of 2021 at the latest.” Casinos and other gambling establishments around the world closed and live poker tournaments were either postponed or cancelled.
This has pushed many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of entertainment has also been affected, with several music groups suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have been looking for ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in place of traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online “festivals” created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their works.
Online, many Internet memes on the topic of the coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism among people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (while the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist sentiments expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or received justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been given to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the people of the areas affected by the virus.
As the epidemic progresses to new sensitive countries, Italians, who are the first country in Europe to suffer from a severe COVID-19 outbreak, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have initially signed petitions to ban the country's health status.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was raging on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus,” a term his critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and studying in major Indian cities have reportedly suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s West Bengal unit Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that’s why God took revenge on them.”
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which described them as “fake”. In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were fueled by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as “foreign waste” that should be “eliminated”.
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made available their scientific articles related to the open access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings quickly on pre-publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods of detection of the virus and detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or asymptomatic people.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests performed in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, in particular the nasopharynx swab or the sputum sample.
Results are usually available within hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed on pharyngeal swabs is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected individuals tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep respiratory tract by aspiration catheter, or sputum (spying) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis for 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all the public Beta-Coronaviruses, ReRT Intermediate by their new disease Control-Coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to the SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR.A United States
Among the older versions of the test kits, one in three genetic test results were inconclusive due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of testing at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout the month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only at that time that federal and local laboratories were authorized to begin screening.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began screening in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced national availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. Sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Center for Research in Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID-19 infection detection test. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4, 128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EAS) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal amplification technology for nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can deliver positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is under development in Taiwan, in the hope that it can provide rapid influenza test results in 15 to 20 minutes, as well.
A March 2020 bibliographic study concluded that “pulmonary x-rays have low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT may be conclusive even before symptoms appear.”
Typical symptoms visible on MDD include multi-lobal bilateral polished glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR with MDD in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that MDD is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with many of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonia and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “DMT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”In March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population monitoring.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
The high-throughput automated systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, a single peripheral blood sample is usually used, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by cutaneous puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and therefore can now distribute their antibody testing.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were sufficiently effective to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan whereby suspicious cases can stay at home, "emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube," patients spit inside, send it back and later receive the test result.The British NHS announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient's infecting them in a sample.
In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had the capacity to perform some 12,000 outpatient tests a day, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study found that in the calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 5 000 samples were sampled by "February" and 64,000 samples were sampled by "February" and 64,000 samples were sampled by "February" and 69% of samples were sampled by "February" and 64% of samples were sampled by "February".
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modeling revealed that cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capability.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Free multiplexed models developed by Origami Assays have been released to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without a liquid manipulator robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, UK and US.
This situation prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples to 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes in order to continue screening.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now the country testing the majority of its population per capita for the Coronavirus, and were in
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-wide high-speed laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capability to be operational outside of China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for making kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was only published on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient tests kits to meet the requirements.
On the other hand, experts say that the high availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
Screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization recommended intensifying screening programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private U.S. laboratories, and reserves of swabs and chemical reagents have evolved.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the U.S., CDC-developed test kits had “defects” and the government removed bureaucratic barriers to private testing.Spain purchased test kits from China’s Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results unreliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be related to the inability to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it will remove kits that gave incorrect results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic provided false results. Slovakia bought from China 1.2 million test kits that proved to be faulty.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were useless.
Screening, followed by forty of those who achieved a positive result, and tracking of people who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, resulted in positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first COVID-19-related death in Italy, conducted two sets of tests on the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Nearly half of the people who achieved a positive result had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracking, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed far less rapidly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on a scheduled date at the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracking, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containments, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as a Percentage of Tests" depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only those admitted to the hospital will have a higher positive percentage of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is about cleaning your hands to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Systematically washing your hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted oro-fecally.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you do not have water or soap on hand, you can wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the diapers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after having sneezed or coughed/sneeded;
after touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste;
Hand hygiene in medical settings refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medication or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals, which can be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate during home births.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Actions to promote handwashing could reduce diarrhea episodes by about one-third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing your hands with soap reduces diarrhea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (IRAs) and should be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, killing nearly 1.8 million people each year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia lead to the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, getting used to washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually associated with other sanitation measures under the WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by flaky skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Over-frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (watering, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or aviary.
It is also appropriate to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after treating a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or biting, after touching animal waste or handling animals, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand cleaning with soap is low.
According to a 2015 study of 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7% of households on average washed their hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the rate was the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China was the lowest in the range (23%).
For example, the Ministry of Education of the Philippines has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily tooth brushing with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, it is necessary to add soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter in the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
Adequate water flow, however, facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were rinsed with the foam.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nevertheless states that “liquid soap vending machines are preferred.”
Antibacterial soaps have been highly recommended to people who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of antiseptics or recommended disinfectants targets organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) which are used to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, which has an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, extracts of plants).
The warm water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have found that the use of warm water did not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-aqueous hand hygiene products (commonly called hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or with a humectant such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively remove germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against viruses of the type norovirus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands as well as the gaps between fingers and nails should be bordered for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid removal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper handwashing unless you do not have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can lead to skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydroalcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since the latter remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers depends heavily on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly inferior to that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have exhibited durable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many do not have the means to buy soap, but instead use ash or land.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands properly to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of the stagnant water points, while the temperature of the water does not seem to make any difference).
Foam a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water basin can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands recontamine more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and scaly nail polish can host microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or other soap solutions are not available. For example, pouring water from a suspended and pierced can or keg and/or using ash if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or schools), there are many alternatives.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a pitcher suspended using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is debated.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilet.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by more modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air jet hand dryers.
After hand washing and hand drying with hot air, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the finger pulp and 254% on the palms.
Air-jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp of 42% and on the palms of 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the finger pulp and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air-jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the device at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the device and possibly contaminate other users of the toilet as well as the toilet environment within a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hand dryer with hot air allows the diffusion of microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing in a medical setting became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that make reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use led to a decrease in infection rates.
Medical handwashing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
As the germs in the water are likely to stay on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
This makes it possible to avoid re-tamning the hands in contact with the surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a brochure outlining the standard procedure for washing and rubbing hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization can also be found on the website to gather feedback from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soaps "medical" or "antimicrobial") gives the handwashing agent an action of destruction of germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing a surgical operation or in environments where the organisms resistant to antibiotics are widespread. In order to "" rub"" the hands for surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a washing product based on chlorine.
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
During rinsing, it should be avoided that water on the forearms flows to the hands.
Once the hands are washed, it is advisable to dry your hands with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical jacket.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits of increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
If we compare hand washing with an ordinary soap to that performed with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, when we compare hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, we find that the first b reduces the contamination by 2 seconds.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing the influenza A virus (H1N1) and Clostridium difficile spores present on the hands. In order to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, it is possible, among other things, to train the staff to wash hands, to put more alcohol-based products at the disposal of the worms and to him.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an inexpensive and essential tool for preserving health and even feeding properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal habits of hand hygiene.
For example, in most rural Africa, faucets are rarely found to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates can also be attributed to stubborn habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating for soap-based handwashing can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of soap-based handwashing, and lead to long-term behavioural change among the population.
For this approach to be successful, monitoring and evaluation activities are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand-washing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. In terms of promoting hand-washing in schools, we can cite the example of UNICEF's "Three-Star Approach ", which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that their hands are respected.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of handwashing stations may be part of the hand hygiene campaigns that are carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an outreach campaign that claims to encourage changing behaviours. Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the number of healthy years of life earned (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in situations of vulnerability such as mothers having just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the middle of the 19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, in Austria, and in Austria.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetid odors called miasmes.
In the 1980s, food-borne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating “good handwashing techniques” were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The term "washing your hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or be an accomplice to something.
It comes from a biblical verse from Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth undertakes to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, symbol of her bad conscience in view of the crimes she committed and which she incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering or considering unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and value handwashing devices more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had these kinds of thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory “purification” measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe handwashing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic handwashing, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of the handwashing rituals put forth in many religions, including Baha'i and Hinduism, the immersion of the hands (tevilah) in the Jewish religion.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash their hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 Risk Controls in the Workplace
COVID-19 risk controls in the workplace refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary depending on the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other collaborators. In this case, only basic preventive measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are ill, breathing label and maintaining a cleaner.
Average exposure risk jobs include those requiring frequent or close contact with people without suspected or known COVID-19 but which may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including in schools, high-density work environments and some large-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, sanitary windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in the event of encounter with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to people with suspected or known COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, becoming a very high risk if they perform aerosol-producing procedures or sampling or manipulating samples from people with suspected or known COVID-19.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have become ill, have to take care of other people or fear possible exposure.
Business models may change, both in terms of the goods requested and the means of acquiring them (including shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the dispatch of articles from geographic regions severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted and an infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context, and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic conditions.
They also outline the necessary controls to deal with these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
Epidemic response objectives include reducing transmission among staff, protecting those at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms a framework that is widely used in occupational health and safety to group risk controls by effectiveness.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and personal protective equipment.
Technical checks involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers; they can be the most economical solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action on the part of the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risk to the worker, appropriately adapted as required (e.g. respiratory masks), worn properly and systematically, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and careful hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory label, including covering mouth and nose to cough and sneeze, providing cleaning handkerchiefs and trash cans, preparing for remote work or other hours of work to use lapse equipment and disinfection.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they no longer have any fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever pills or other medications acting on symptoms. They also advise that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they have no fever, fever signs or other symptoms.
According to OSHA, jobs at average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or close contact, within six feet (1.8 m) of people without suspected or known COVID-19 but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to an area with widespread COV transmission.
This encompasses workers' work in contact with the general public, especially in schools, working environments with a high-density protection, working environments with a high-density protection, working environments with a high-volume protection, working environments with a high-density protection, working environments with a high-density protection, working environments with a high-density protection, and working environments with a high-dens protection.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to wear respiratory masks.
If a person becomes ill aboard an aeroplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the patient from others by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a member of the crew to care for the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when he coughs or sneezes.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Disposable gloves and other items must be disposed of in a bag intended for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include the postponement of travel in the event of illness as well as the development of self-isolation and immediate information to the medical centre.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be carried out in the cabin of the isolated person. For school and child care institutions, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the case of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as cancelling educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or canteen meals, by increasing the space between the offices, by staggering the time of arrival and departure, by reducing the number of visitors.
In case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays may be considered. For law enforcement officers who carry out routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to come into contact with persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including wearing adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before reuse with a wipe or household detergent spray and follow standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE as well as containment and laundry.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers to belong to categories with high or very high exposure risk.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform aerosol-producing procedures or take or handle samples from patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
Funeral jobs at high risk of exposure include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of their death; they are at very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when performing procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain sanitary and funeral settings.
Samples shall be handled using Level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working within 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 or higher filtration respiratory masks must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program including medical adaptation, training and examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better worker comfort. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted through organic fluids.
The WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask only by screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care of or carry COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective goggles or facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In the case of an aerosol-producing procedure, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, the WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE by means of telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a room occupied by a COVID-19 patient to the people directly involved in his care, using the PPE necessary for the specific task only, and the continued use of the PPE without the respiratory mask.

OBJECT: [Covid-19] Lightening the burden and preparing for the future
DATE/TIME OF SHIPPING: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENSE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month we find ourselves in an exceptional situation.
The COVID-19 outbreak is a clear demonstration of our overall human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community strengthening globally that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and kindness that we have observed among all our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we are fortunate to work.
I could not be more grateful and proud to count you all among my colleagues.
Last week, someone expressed their gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the moment, and the strong symbol that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you keep the sites operational, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make substantial adjustments to the way we work together from next week onwards.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team-C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the days and months ahead.
During this conversation, we considered what we believe would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and how best to ensure the viability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don’t worry.
To all staff, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily working time goal will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further order.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, go shopping or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your hours.
If you are sick, don’t work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
No sick leave or paid leave required: Just let your boss know and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan of the T&amp;C Ops department know so that the T&amp;C can help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from management.)
Hourly staff will be fully remunerated.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honouring our responsibilities to our subcontractors and our colleagues on schedule.
Everyone will be remunerated on the basis of their usual working hours performed under normal conditions.
This is true if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to evacuate their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve yourself.
We simply ask you to contact your superior, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are certain things we need to keep doing.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Amp; Security & Fundraising teams (among others) are performing essential work that may need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and focus on supporting the fundamental tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most indispensable projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to “work twice as hard to catch up with lost time” when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to do overtime to meet now unrealistic deadlines.
We acknowledge that circumstances have changed, and we will endeavour to establish new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time targets, we plan to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to budget so employees can focus on essential work, take care of themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and the pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will inform delegates and teams of the next steps upon confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Location, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of excessive caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington D.C. office is located in a WeWork premises, which shared with us and all of the staff based in Washington D.C. their COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but may be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues familiar with remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to sessions of up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider spreading them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the norm, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchange.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or perform a collective note-taking).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your wellness reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remotes channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR operations team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increased distribution of work within the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the Community Grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized for delays or changes in these objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The overall feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness at the upheaval and relief at the clarity and the opportunity to focus on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Staying in touch despite COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns all of us and we are here to help you in any way.
Until then, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all information in one place.
We also endeavour to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a significant workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and provide liaison if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global International HR Operations.
None of these changes should be regarded as an abandonment of our work and obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of recognizing that at the present time our work and our obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we deem necessary to support each other and to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to provide the world with the service that everyone can rely on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and perhaps the months ahead.
We need each and every one of you to achieve this, which is why you need to protect yourself and take care of your families so that you can give your best when the time comes.
Finally, please: wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'The angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme linked to the outer face (cell membranes) of cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminated peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminated renal amino acid transporter collectrin domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, whose enzymatically active domain is exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is linked to the cell membrane mainly from the cells of the pulmonary alveolus type II, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
Expression of ACE2 mRNA is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate for the ACE.
ACE cleaves the hormone angiotensin I into vasoconstrictive angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxyl-terminated phenylamine amino acid of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and the hydrolysis into vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Hi-Ile-I).
ACE2 can also cleave several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary point of entry into the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spicule protein S1 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and in the translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of the protein S by the TMPRSS2 host serine protease, the inhibition of the latter is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that the reduction of ACE2 levels in the cells can contribute to the fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard treatment with ACE inhibitors and BRAs.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, demonstrated that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less conclusive than for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
The recombinant human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is known as an innovative treatment of severe lung lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people who are intolerant of classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors or for diseases with high circulation of angiotensin II. Infusion rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identifying people (“contacts”) likely to have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, especially those that rely on tracking the geographic location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature that supports these Bluetooth apps.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an app in China that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, while Singapore has opted for an app called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local community of computer scientists, it has been provided in open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched “StopKorona!”, a Bluetooth app that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicates with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was pending approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering implementing applications based on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and based on the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geotracking application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, discussed several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the app.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple only authorizes “official” or generally trusted organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have raised concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to address the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have set out eight conditions to be met in government projects:
Surveillance should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”.
Extents of control and surveillance should include extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrably protected;
Digital surveillance should ensure that there is no exacerbation of discrimination and marginalisation;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined by law;
protections against abuse and remedies for citizens in the event of abuse should be provided;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists, which would require the “significant participation” of all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalized groups.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistence of surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of apps, which eliminates both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all central server-based systems need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used for contact tracking.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, which they then combined to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government has also made location information publicly available, which was authorized as a result of profound changes to information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
Details had not yet been disclosed on April 6, 2020.
Privacy contact tracing is a well-established concept, backed by a large volume of research data as early as 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preservation Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for ContactP Mobile.
These protocols ensure that personally identifiable data never leaves the device and that all matching is done on the device.
The MIT Media Lab’s Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the white paper “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key factor in their adoption by a broad public.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the release of the BlueTrace protocol source code used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would protect privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with confidential cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Deploying tools to enable governments to create official privacy-friendly coronavirus tracing applications
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the problem of solution adoption and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through OS updates and removing it later in the same way once the threat is removed.
The repositioning of a drug (also called reorientation, reprofiling, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) means the reconversion of a drug approved for a disease or medical condition other than the one for which it was originally developed.
This is an axis of scientific research currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the plasma transfusion of convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites offers the realistic project of developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain protease, RNA polymerase dependent RNA, helicase, protein S and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and is authorised under the U.S.A. only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who are unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that “the use, dosage, or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors have indicated using this drug “when there is no other option”.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
More extensive studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School conducts a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study of 240 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, half received favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian drug agency has reminded the public that the existing evidence in favor of the drug is thin and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up possibilities for the Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that “no benefit was observed”.
These drugs have been designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would bind with SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about the use of resources for repositioning drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections, and Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one involving people with moderate disease and the other in those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.

Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian drug agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study involving 300 patients studying the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many developmental attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing a Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic broke out around the world in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform's targets for Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As stated by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) are confirmed as active and 37 are announced, but with little public information available (assumed under planning or design).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and performed in several centers, determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the efficacy of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccines (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human evaluation phase (still in “preclinical” research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that it has begun work on a vaccine, whose human testing is expected to begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun work on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to neoantigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.
On March 25, the director of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it had started a vaccine project with the aim of creating an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plan to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both located in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a partnership with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for preclinical testing and a Phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in an accelerated procedure, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle thanks to partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is currently undergoing laboratory research, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large sums of money to benefit from exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine,” sparking protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech for the joint development of a mRNA-based vaccine.
The BNT162 mRNA vaccine candidate is currently in preclinical testing with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a US$4.9 million investment in a consortium for the search for a COVID-19 vaccine including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total US$29 million investment against COPID in the development of a vaccine.
The other investment partners of CEPI for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun testing animals on six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of sending the sequence by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian societies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that “the microneedle-administered SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine subunits triggered an important response of antigen-specific antibodies.”
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 health professionals.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of a vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need to implement Level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no curative or protective vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS were a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three more were in progress; all vaccines were viral-vector, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have spread a conspiracy theory that the virus that caused COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of taste, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases produce moderate symptoms, some evolve to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, leading to more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have healed. The virus spreads mainly through close contact, often through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Since these droplets are produced at exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than posing an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing the mask by the general public vary, with some authorities discouraging its use, others recommending its use, and others still imposing its use.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, failure of several organs and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and under study. Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; out of 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both sputum and saliva can carry significant viral loads.
Speaking loudly releases more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing unprotected can throw droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patient chambers produced viral RNA-positive samples.
Certain medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus lead to aerial spread.
Although there are concerns about spreading through stool, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spreading may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, a person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives for hours or even days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, disabling it and removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the Wuhan acute respiratory disease foci.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in coronavirus-related viruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells through the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) which is most abundant in the alveolar type II cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a surface-specific glycoprotein called "spicule" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injuries have been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan hospital, China, and are more common when the disease is more severe.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be linked to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammable infiltrates.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE-2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF secreting T cells have been associated with recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at the autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses real-time polymerase reverse chain reaction (rRT-PCR) transcription.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, a nasal or sputum sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours or even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however they require two blood samples taken at two weeks intervals and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world were able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (likely to detect active infections and a person’s previous infection) were in development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experiment of the test revealed an accuracy of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test closest to the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used later this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University’s Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobary bilateral frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the onset of infection.
Pleural dominance, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinuclear giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exsudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
curing pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering the face with cloth in public places to limit transmission to asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing movements and cancelling large groups of people.
The distance guidelines also include compliance with a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There is no known drug to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Given that a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key element in managing COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic peak, also known as “flattening the curve”.
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after they have been on the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after they have wetted, coughed, or sneeze.
It also recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant solution containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where commercial hand disinfectants are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulae, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol, it is "not an antiseptic active substance for hands".
Glycerin is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy, and support of other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analyzed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatments can be useful for those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection.The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for care for people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Resuscitators and pulmonologists in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
As for symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in conditions of care where the performance of procedures may generate aerosols, such as manual intubation or ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an airborne infection-suitable isolation chamber (AIRI) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions for airborne transmission. The CDC highlights guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (facial masks) are preferred.
N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (EAS).
They are designed to protect from aerial particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or as a last resort, artisanal masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases is.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for inpatients. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be prevented by using a high-flow nasal cannula or dual-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either or both produce the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-throughput nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in older adults (those over 60, and especially those over 80).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, limiting the ability of the care system to treat a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5 per cent of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3 per cent needed respiratory assistance and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with pressure control modes and high PEEP are required to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs being tested are already approved for other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral drug can be tried in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted a temporary authorization for the plasma of convalescent people as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to the necessary clinical trials to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an ID.
The application is capable of detecting “near contacts” using monitoring data and thus detecting a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. Mass data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, in Taiwan and
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at enforcing quarantine and protecting people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared aggregate phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who are not in quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that “40% of people continue to move.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may have a moderate course with little or no symptoms, resembling other common respiratory tract diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, however data for COVID-19 are lacking. In some cases, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of hospitalized cases with COVID-19, with renal failure observed in 4% of people in this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 percent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 percent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem pulmonary samples show diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cellular exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, cardiac injuries due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest were observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had pre-existing pathologies. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region can also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the disease mortality rate vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Undernumbering moderate cases may lead to overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and were 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns have also arisen about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The hospital administration in Hong Kong observed a 20% to 30% drop in breathing capacity in some people cured of the disease, and lung scans suggest organic damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether a previous infection provided effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered probable, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of people cured of COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus testing at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and animal-derived, by spreading the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost solely led by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet found that the earliest date of onset of symptoms dates back to December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications have indicated the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measurements are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency pathological codes ICD-10 U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths of clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 cases without SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in the laboratory.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global death/case ratio is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious mortality rate (IFR) that reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed or undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and to young people, leading to a relatively low mortality rate, and all COVID-19-related deaths may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overrun.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to be related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among men in their fifties, with the difference between men and women only disappearing at age 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors may be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women and the development of comorbidities in men such as hypertension at a younger age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of people who died of COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government does not collect data related to the genus of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be “COVID-19”.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the WHO uses “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus responsible” in its public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as “coronavirus” and “Wuhan coronavirus.”
In January 2020, the WHO recommended the use of the 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV interim disease names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 directive against the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in time, a local startup retrodesigned and printed the required 100 valves in one night.
After the initial COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to certain other animals.
Studies have not found evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE 2 receptor to penetrate human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, the researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spicule S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for creating vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from all of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs make up the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries expected to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
Preliminary data suggest the efficacy of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some are asking for an independent analysis of the research.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that twice that dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of physicians caring for COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein initiating using serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokin shock can be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is undergoing a nationally non-randomized phase 2 test in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it must counteract such developments that are suspected to be causing the death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cells, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of CRS.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have cured COVID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody-based treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Serum production from convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of patients healed and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, later contracted COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
