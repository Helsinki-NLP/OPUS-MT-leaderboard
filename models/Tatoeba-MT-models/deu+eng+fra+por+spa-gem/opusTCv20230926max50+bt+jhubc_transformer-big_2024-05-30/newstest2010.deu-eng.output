Barack Obama wins the Nobel Peace Prize as fourth US President
U.S. President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to be the fourth U.S. President in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check of 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern Norwegian metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members, who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit culminates with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestige award.
He is the fourth president of the United States, but only the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when he takes the prize.
The president does not want to dodge this issue because he knows he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
A few days ago, he reinforced his war efforts by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmedal, the Diploma and the cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The program then includes a banquet with the President and his wife, with the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests attending besides Norway’s king and queen.
Obama was very restrained from the beginning of the price.
He said, for example, that he felt he didn’t deserve the price.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for all those who seek the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that for him this was "invitation to action".
Conservatives accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the civil association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for blackmail.
In several cases he filed appeals last year against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said the Principal Police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaft is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in jail and is facing a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian villages you can find again on foot and kick the sorting garbage containers.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable trash cans.
I do not want to say that waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councillors are inadequately concerned with this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste separations in the jungle league, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers here, but above all because of the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose of PET bottles in a collection basket?
This is just art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place that I have found so far by chance is the moorland opposite the Affected Goose.
Mr Onderka, your colleagues should not be annoyed, but I think that is far too little.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is also not honey in other parts.
All of my friends don’t sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
It’s too far to the trash cans.
I'm not surprised.
Even after the celebration, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street, I didn’t see any ink bins in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when I was driving by tram.
The garbage almost ran over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us shame all over the Republic, instead of buying a few more trash cans and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption even with official statistics after searching the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst there in the entire district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has deprived the money for pensions and health benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, health benefits and construction savings.
But not for the state debt interest rate or for the international litigation.
This is causing even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the wage increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or for the sickness allowance. "This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, mine layers," says Janota.
The loans are gradually paying higher and higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the state treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state operation are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party gave more money now: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
In order to get the pensions or the sick allowance, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people don’t have to be afraid to get that money.
But for the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will thus increase more and more rapidly, and together with it the costs and interest will also increase.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counterefficiency package.
Due to the money-drafting in favor of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
These are mostly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly cheapened.
At the very best, which is not free.
This means delay or discontinuation of thirty large buildings, the European money creation is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the outflow of money in the Solomon Islands - it attacks the CEZ share dividends, in which the state owns the majority, and from these the money will then be distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is not an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion euros went into the budget from CEZ.
Annually, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is filled up and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to EU rules, the actual budget deficit rises to 5.7 percent of GDP.
But the carnival of upheavals is not over yet.
Almost $3 billion was lost on various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, or on expenses for litigation, including building savings.
Whether the state will manage without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court case, we have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budgetary reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already started two-billion-dollar project "Staatskasse", which is meant to allow to monitor on-line what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
Americans expect for the future a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to just press a button, and from Windows Mobile Android will change in a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced to the journalist the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, running at the same time the aforementioned systems Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and customers are expected to get the devices in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains torments hotel owners
Snow-free slopes are not just worrisome for Giant Mountain residents.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our sites are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but by now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, said.
Anyone who wants the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly as they wish should not hesitate with ordering.
Those who prefer saving and where the quality of the stay comes in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they too will have to give in and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, esteemed Jandura.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper holidays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, said.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year’s Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer open spaces here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, Schiefert says.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, it manages to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year’s Eve and Christmas we only have a few free rooms left.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
For the New Year's Eve stays, the Hotel Omnia is also occupied by the central car park in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne remain free for Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied at the moment.
February is a little weaker now, but the moment the snow comes, interest in staying in the Giant Mountains is surely increasing, said the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a larger amount of snow.
On Thursday it should cool and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But afterwards warming will come again, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeat is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost strange with which student aspiration Barack Obama, the president with his reputation as the wisest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he himself considered the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off on the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text himself, he has even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward" without hesitation.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea – sending fresh troops to Iraq plagued by the civil war – as “an irresponsible and in its consequences catastrophic decision.”
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and very successful one, to the extent that the news about Iraq no longer speaks at all.
Bush’s reputation was not improved by this, because objectively he left his successor with a much more grateful starting situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will repeat itself.
The military once again asked him to increase the troop contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite his subordination habits, criticized the tacit shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but came up with no better idea, and so he betrayed General Wenistens by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he originally expected at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even despite the fraternal war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honoring the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by contraindication - no one can be trusted and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only fake buildings behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balancing of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially due to the inconspicuousness of the circumstances that further complicate Pakistan and Iran influences.
The establishment of a “performing state”, which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy astonished by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and now it is on the verge of explosion.
Believing that the little soldiers who broke out into the cry of war about the "early homecoming" can do a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is declining.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very serious question arises for the United States whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America is moving towards Obama’s withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turning point in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years to go until the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time for him to resort to a different strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive cash bonuses
The executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
This has been announced by the company, which thus reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be deprived of managers in the event that they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to link Wall Street’s premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is aware of the further direction it has to go, JPMorgan’s former banker, Douglas Elliott, said.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
The high bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries with the start of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers’ bonuses, which exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000, once with a 50 percent tax.
Similar steps are also being prepared by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except in physics.
Five record women took over this year’s Nobel prizes in specialist categories and for literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four scientists, among them was the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with her compatriot Jack Szostak for chromosome research.
Israel’s Ada Jonath, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, won the prize for chemistry for enlightenment on ribosome structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao for fiber optic research and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the foundation of all digital chambers, fax devices or astronomical telescopes, won this award.
Each of these prize winners has received the diploma, the Nobel medals and certificate of the acquisition of the prize money.
This amounts to ten million Swedish kronor in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money price is divided among them.
Traditionally, US President Barack Obama received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and he is at the forefront of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations to fight for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
On Friday, President Vaclav Klaus welcomes Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his stay in government because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form it was approved by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps also the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis in public finances.
The presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which Klaus now receives for signature, the Czech Republic should be able to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, parliament voted on the Left Party proposals on money circulation and increased the money for state officials’ salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages for farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party, on the other, a sharp domestic policy dispute has arisen, for which the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer-Official Cabinet, on the design of which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of austerity measures that were enforced by the Fischer government in the autumn, and that, in their understanding, should end the state debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget but does not have to, explained today at the breakfast discussion with the entrepreneurs that the politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" that represents "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution anymore.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolanek said the budget was horrific, and the government should weigh its continued existence.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words as “strong statements” in the editorial board.
CSSD chief Jiri Paroubek responded to Topolanek’s words that the budget deficit was horrific that the former Topolanek government had prepared for this year, and that it exceeded 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in Clint Eastwood’s new film by Morgan Freeman.
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film “Invictus: The Unbeaten” shows the world a lot of the country, of whose struggle and victories despite some criticism that the lead was occupied by an American actor.
It tells the story of sport, race, and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system in the South African Republic as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, depicts in his life story the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became the slaveholder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely is someone who still lives and so important to many people.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to agree on the rugby players who are among the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the World Cup of the year 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
I’ve noticed that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it will be transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It’s important for me to be another person.
In the film, Matt Damon portrays Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have outnumbered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a great surprise to him when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember when I ringed the doorbell that it opened and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the actors' stature compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and there is also talk of prospects for an Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his evaluation in the following words: "That was a very good story, a very well-executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway solved: Russians tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile had been tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was unsuccessful again, and the rocket called the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become a nightmare of the Russian generality as well as of the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the rocket tests had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been launched at all or damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers already write about "Bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly, but lights
The 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the missile occurred again.
Probably the engine exploded in the third missile stage.
This time, "Bulava" departed from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows firing from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern paths was actually the damaged "Bulava".
The Norwegians have not doubted from the very first moment that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generality has guarded against it and claims that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Although no test start was made without errors, the Department of Defense’s leadership considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The nearly fifty percent success therefore satisfies the generality with optimism and so it is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even carry up to ten hypersonic atomic blast heads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov is again presenting himself in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in distress, and is likely to compete against Petersburg already in the Friday duel KHL.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas is injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
It is unclear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will affect only one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those that can raise the morale of other players, said Nemcinov.
If Fetisov returns to the ice, he will be the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game according to AP.
In the NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, with 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and also triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career, he also garnered successes in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room.
Hyundai gave in to the trade unions. All overtime is cancelled
The management of the Nosovice Hyundai automobile factory agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai Automotive Factory spokesman Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed on the grounds that two shifts of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered employees who would work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 CZK.
The employees will also receive it in retrospect for the Saturday shift of November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the ticket and lunch.
Taking into account that overtime was the most urgent and burning point regarding demands and complaints of the unionists who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work 2 overtime hours virtually every day after the eight-hour shift.
Upon the signing of the agreement, the willingness of the trade unions to strike will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are to be concluded on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on meeting the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the readiness to strike.
The situation in the automobile factory worsened last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management, however, held that the employees had to do the overtime to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The unionists also demanded in their Monday-ready-for-strike statement that the employees who had interrupted production on the previous Wednesday would not be punished.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions demand to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they demand this year to pay the remuneration of 5,000 crowns.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Series production was started at the company in November last year.
As of September, around 80,000 vehicles have been produced here, with a current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with <0xCC><0x81>stealed <0xCC><0x81> HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to stop the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not work as strongly on common virus variants as one of the already existing drugs.
AIDS cannot be cured.
However, the drug composition can prolong life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of viral proliferation also leads to the development of resistant viruses against which no longer medicinal products are effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metalocarboranes act on the protein that is responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multivariate cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV-protease-induced HIV virus splitting, no mature infectious virus particles would occur.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the proliferation of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in the press report, published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed further.
A bit weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against the HIV protease was tested in the test tube, also against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, make the metalocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Sciences of Academic Genetics.
Dispute over budget. ODS went on fishermen, who are resisting
ODS chairman Mirek Topolanek called the approved budget for next year “great” and Jan Fischer’s prime minister’s government should consider its continued existence.
The ODS statement was described by the prime minister as "strong statements".
It is supposed to be time for analysis.
Deputy ODS Chairman Petr Necas said the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the SDGs and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament on Wednesday adopted the budget for 2010, though with proposals for amendments to the Left Party over 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for public officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to trade with a lag of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has fulfilled the wish of the government, because also the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke about his disappointment and sense of senselessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign if the amendments were accepted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government deal.
He has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment in the use of the budget.
To what extent Fischer is in favour of the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with it in the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will step down if parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, for example those relating to health benefits and pensions or the new service law.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is the responsibility of the Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are deputy people who profess to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to renounce the fight against the deficit height of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left majority that is currently in parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the Citizen Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it is up-to-date, then I will deal with it," said Martin Bartak, Minister of Defence, who was nominated by the Democrats, to journalists in parliament.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the European Council meeting.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the SDGs would likely vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in parliament if the prime minister explicitly asked the MPs of the Citizen Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question of whether the SDG was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize my voice was missing.
Already when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevization of the Parliament and the destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for about the same fare.
The Czech Railways will terminate or restrict some of the less busy and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by 2% from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares incl. basic and customer fare are not changed.
Several connections to the capital are available, for example, to the residents of the Ostrava area, the railway employs for this route trains of the type Pendolino.
The high-speed train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
There will also be fewer high-speed trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The biggest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of 8%, but Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains will also be lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and the operation of some high-speed trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced to a few days a week.
Among the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth transport route of the Esko suburban transport system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distances to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at a time interval of two hours.
Passengers have been unable to travel to Bratislava with the Pendolino since December 13.
This year's account for regional railways: increase of 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total, the railway receives four billion crowns to compensate for the so-called loss of liquidity in the next year, just like this year. The local trains supply the districts, in total they pay eight billion crowns for it in the next year, with the state shooting down three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains as well as high-speed trains, the railway has newly concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps that is why they did not resort to price increases on the vast majority of tickets.
Changes can only be made with one-day CD Net and cheap eLiska internet tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net will be increased from 450 kronor to 600 kronor.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven stick, until now it was uniform for the trip between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine billionaires have arrested more than 50 people and the children have been released.
Millions have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some elementary students and their teachers.
This was reported by the agency AFP, which originally only informed about 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
He was kidnapped in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 million people reportedly used the hostages as a living shield while fleeing from police.
The local negotiators are now working to release the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the militants belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the law of standing was imposed due to the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was associated with the election to the governorate, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But those who resumed peace negotiations with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods is coming to the American cinemas "Invictus: The Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who had already been allegedly chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the film’s cinema launch, reactions from critics and the public will also be loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, then in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
High expectations are placed in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when, on the one hand, South Africa’s preparations for the World Cup culminate, but at the same time the media shock the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations against the casting of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela several times in person so that I could - as they say - receive his energy, he performed in an interview after the film's festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if we can get to Mandela’s personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
Dressed by the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book template by British writer John Carlin, freely translated ‘In the Role of the Enemy’: Nelson Mandela and the Game that united the people, portrays the South African advocate of human rights during his first presidential election period.
Over the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two race-defined populations and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in the South African National Rugby Dress, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in dress, which is considered almost a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped great ovations fourteen years ago, predominantly from the white audience, thus winning the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may in turn bring people together into a single people, rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995, said.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve, that will only prove.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled the country to Britain, told LN in a recent interview.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, spokesman for the district fire brigade, six units were attacked in the fire.
Originally the fire department wanted to burn out the transformers, but later they changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water foam and special extinguishing materials.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer short-circuit.
According to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatova, no one was injured, the disaster endangered the security operation of the line system.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more accurately the damage will be calculated only after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For over 10 years nothing similar has happened in the company Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
According to the spokeswoman of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted, and the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgear systems with 67 transformers, which transmit the electrical energy into the distribution system and line path with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jancura filed criminal charges against three heads of the CSSD for defamation.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today filed a criminal complaint for slander against three Social Democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit relates to the company's efforts to operate regional train traffic in some districts.
In the end, however, all regions have signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, while we only submitted the offer about the scope as it was coordinated with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were closed last week.
We have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he said that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the prosecution of the criminal complaint to be the continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his society as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I am also calling for other leaders to do so.
I assume it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public and uses lying and untrue arguments in the area of regional rail traffic, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the disadvantageous step of the districts.
He told the radio newspaper that he is interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and intends to continue it after New Year.
He said he will lead the anti-corruption campaign as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and had not tendered for the order in a height of 150 billion kronor.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn’t give up, we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who they are, I don’t say his name, Jancura told the radio newspaper today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal infections free of charge and voluntarily
Pneumococcal vaccination will change the usual from January.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But already now votes are reporting that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal culminate.
The pharmacological institute is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New Vaccination
Free vaccines for August-Children
From January onwards, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal infections born on August 2nd last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
Anyone who started the vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for another repeat vaccination themselves.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal infections.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Vaccination of younger children requires four doses.
Overall, the experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all area vaccinations of children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal causes middle-ear inflammation, but also severe infections including cerebral skin inflammation and blood poisoning.
As a result of pneumococcal infections, up to 28 children aged up to 10 years die each year after examination in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory vaccination of children against pneumococcal infections was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it will be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
That the mandatory vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, the head of the citizens' association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has been advocating pneumococcal vaccination for the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association participated were not very pleased that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have succeeded in enforcing at least that.
I think that’s the way we have to go now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal infections.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochova, chairman of the Association of Practical Pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
“In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one,” Cabrnochova says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcal infections from next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first area vaccination paid by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention so that they can save for further treatment, Cabrnochova says.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern of practical pediatricians concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the state to them.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance companies could “expend the money from health insurance.”
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to estimates, individual medical practitioners will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This is not going to be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist son involved in 'museum theft'
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal $20 million in paintings from his father’s museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his trailer when he invited 90 paintings into his vehicle.
Frank Frazetta junior and another man are said to have used an excavator to penetrate the museum into the Pocono Mountains.
81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures like Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
According to the Associated Press, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP cited an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should penetrate the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a camp".
The agency reported that Frank Frazetta Senior denied giving any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the previous report against criticism from the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "passed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also came under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent cap on public wage accounts for 2011.
Social security annoyance
The unions have protested that low-wage recipients are being punished for a recession that they did not cause and warned of impending “problems”.
The rise in social security – to about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year – has angered the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
SECURITIES OF THE PROVISIONAL REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy shrinks by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bank bonuses
1% increase in corporate tax for small businesses
Tax discounts for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year, and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 a year will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person with <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 annual income will be richer by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their target of deficit halving by 2013 meant “difficult decisions,” but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be on the 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending cuts compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone".
"These are big numbers, they will bring us the deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions of future economic growth – affecting the extent of re-indebtedness and the speed of deficit relief – were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year — far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April — while debt would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Missed Opportunity"
The conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion debt would be unsustainable over the next six years.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how they will repay this and push themselves "cynically" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
“They didn’t say anything meaningful about what they’re going to do,” said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond, “they had their chance to do this, and they let them pass by.”
“The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be saved from future cuts, unlike in the Conservatives’ proposals, which see deficit cuts coming faster and more likely.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money earned by the tax increases and spending cuts is being used to cover spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were “built on sand.”
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements, some things like the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April would expose the Chancellor to the charge of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid when people need it most and that the situation be reviewed in September 2010.
"Hohler Staat"
Although the ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only apply in the medium term.
The acclaimed Institute for Tax Investigations said the Chancellor’s figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the areas of transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“It only shifts the pain to later,” said its director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor at audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary budget report. The markets recognize that."
FBI Investigates ‘Arrests of U.S. Citizens in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panchab province, the American embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are being charged with and the circumstances under which they are being detained," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it is actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had already been interested in the house before and that no charges have been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but she said the United States must “work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradicating the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns ‘abuse’ in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as they have been in the past 20 years.
The report details "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes; another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the report by 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with “working with Facebook networks” and protesting against the election results.
“They punched me in the face more often,” he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half-unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty said.
Beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner, who said he and 75 others had been detained in a container in a prison in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and government responses to it, but Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results gained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the past three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park, ski slopes were set up
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competitive track.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jumping slope at the beginning of a 100-metre-long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also pretty intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city shining below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Awards were awarded for the best pieces of art performed on the slope - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
Still you and me
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted to ban the construction of minarets and concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a sound and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's latest work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (Original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argued study of a dispute that shared and occupied the country over one and a half decades and whose effects can still be perceived today.
Bowen’s latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5-6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it “Islamic free spaces.”
He is a good listener, he relays debates between teachers and students about the issues that disturb them most.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or a town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane affairs, he claims, that make up daily life, quite in contrast to the political dramas that the media engages in.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them by any known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society.
They don’t have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interviewed Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of puristic Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – who nowadays show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questioned the extent to which French policymakers (and the intellectual elite so passionately guarding the separation of church and state) really felt committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who in turn had to make their historic compromise with secular Republicanism.
He sees more a "strengthening of the screws of values" than a growing pragmatism.
After reading this book, you are inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most despondent view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes them melts with alarming speed and takes life with it that nowhere else can survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have embarked on the recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel waters.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Known in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers who proved themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old flagship to the sea, who only fought with the bullet of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have one millionth of the range of life of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore has turned green from the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and sled-driving Inuit use powerful assault rifles to bring their prey to the track.
Ironically, the ice in the northern waters of these two hunting nations will survive the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanation attempts.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries suggested for the first time the turbulence of pack ice.
Underwater boats so much in the Cold War the shifting ridges while undergoing.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by salt water rinses squeezed when freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in the ice, all are threatened when the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... it could be us"
Marines were among the 6,000 who settled wreaths in Arlington.
Brigadier De'Angelo Robinson traveled by bus for seven hours to place a single wreath on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval infantrymen who made the journey from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they followed.
“In a few months, wherever we are brought back from, we could be,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington Cemetery.
It’s now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in various cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas of the Pentagon, at the tombs of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she took the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to return something to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family tomb.
Packed in places of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older tombs from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam War as their target, as these are not visited as often as the newer tombs, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing and couples held hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the greying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends held together in the icy air.
Some read the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white maps that had been placed in the moist mud for those whose gravestones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son’s grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the tomb of Marine Infrastructure Sub-officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free...my son paid for it, she said.
"If I've been gone for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor selling mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, foreign ministry officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
U.S. consular officials in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything, under the accusation of "endangerment".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including slight protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will likely increase tensions between the Castro Brother’s communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely restricted on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there to foreign visitors and to some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are sitting behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Office in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give further information about the arrest.
Arrest and imprisonment are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, which recently released a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba", a reference to the inauguration of the older Fidel as the leader of the country.
Vivanco said the defendants would be very often arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as both countries are moving towards each other for more willingness to dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday an allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, saying they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruits searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he found them because one of them had made consenting comments on the internet video site YouTube about terrorist attacks.
Upon their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the matter said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, the government official said, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men – who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI – underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and possibly more importantly in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US intelligence service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The solicitors of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are undergoing a special test by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be immensely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest ranking analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow access to, as U.S. intelligence services have become experts on their recruitment methods.
If you try to inject someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding bolder action on climate action from the negotiators at the city’s Bella Congress Center.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be around 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists fired small explosives near some government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little happened at the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists wandered around the city wearing transparencies with the words “There is no Planet B” in English and one in Spanish that declared “The Earth says “Enough”.
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, her mother’s birthplace, makes her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already noticeable impacts of climate change.
That’s part of the motive why I decided to take part in the big demonstration – to spread the word and appeal to world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It’s not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there’s no way around it anymore.
Police stopped protesters from getting too close to Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he was involved in the climate negotiations, demonstrators masked in black clothing fired several explosive bodies near the Copenhagen main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as luminous rockets but were then followed by “a few large explosions.”
Inside the congress center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently failed to reach the awareness of key officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
Asked if he thought the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: “This is something I wasn’t even aware of.”
He then went on to Mandarin and said, “Because the venue is big, I can’t hear what’s happening outside.”
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “it can also be said that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people.”
Examination data show persistent race gap
The mathematics performance certificates were welcomed good news for the public schools in Washington D.C. last week.
Although Washington District is still far behind the nation’s top performing schools, testimonies show that fourth and eighth grades have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) over the past two years, but their African-American peers only rose by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-American eighth graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average white pupil score was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was captured in that district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children from both groups achieved has grown over this period, the difference has barely decreased with 58 points now.
Some district education advocates expressed concern last week that the results celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already high-performing children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates education equality in Washington D.C.
I don’t jump up and down for a two or three-point span, said Democratic Washington City Councilman Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in fourth grade at Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of exam scores is that the city’s middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, which I respect.
But what scares me is that we don’t nearly spend the time and energy that we would have to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and middle school who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school careers and who are significantly behind their peer-to-peer classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that brings to the fore from kindergarten to sixth grade games and life-like experiences, has been brought to Washington under former school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum attributes some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think we need to continue to work on making the best measures benefit the students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools that are needed to bridge the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who examines urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to target its resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could lead to political repercussions that work against this important agenda item.
The weak point, of course, is, as with other urban school inspectors, that she tries to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to make sure we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, now school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements of closing the performance gap is extending the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with charter schools.
You have to increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he considered to be "a milestone" on the way to a bigger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a prospect for the future
The coach reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents have barely completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Her attitude and that of the other eighth graders of the group exploring Gettysburg, where the class costs $38,690 a year, was more that of a reverend visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, here I will be soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had now entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told of the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
College in Pennsylvania was the 7th the kids visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully received the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education necessary to rise to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” of Hispanic Americans graduates from college – which is a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the U.S. without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who examine high-performance children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive for success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who studied Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program funded by Graciela’s College tour is a useful example.
It’s known as GEAR UP — one gear up — and provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to start college preparatory programs that begin when low-income students are in high school and continue until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in renovating the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has pulled the shortening.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly seeded representatives of American oil multitudes at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asians and Europeans are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, underscored by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability due to the withdrawal of the U.S. military, have likely prevented American oil companies from engaging more in Iraq, which holds the world’s third-largest proven crude oil reserves.
U.S. companies were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to hold shareholders accountable.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies that were able to enter into contracts with the ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have supported technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the Ministry of Oil spokesman Assam Jihad said, that China is on its way to becoming one of the majors in the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
Pre-selected companies placed bids for the bid, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the emission of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda top planner reportedly killed in Pakistan
In an obvious U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda deployment planner was reportedly killed this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials reported on Friday.
This, if confirmed, would be the second deadly attack on a senior terrorist organization official this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were killed by a number of missiles that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in northern Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan’s lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly took in everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited indefinite evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somalia has been described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, which led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, pointing to the sensitive nature of the US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Assuming its central role as given, this also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had quickly risen in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and had best ties to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this in no way diminishes the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal territory, and three other top activists were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of CIA drone attacks has declined from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary in the Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The UN’s top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down from office in March, ending a stormy term clouded by claims of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the troop increase, but he also expressed concern that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, which is set to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their armed forces.
We must accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aides to help in Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he did not step down from office, but only fulfilled an agreement made in March 2008 with his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to send a message to the United Nations.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so that he has time to arrange for a replacement.
What I’ve said is that he’s better off starting to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun searching for a replacement.
The UN officials say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-original Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
His position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential election and covering up evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide has rejected all allegations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith - who was fired - "undoubtedly harmed the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism regarding international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a senior civil representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying this would strengthen their confidence in their money being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN hiring regulations have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I have only been able to hire one person.
This is disastrous and must not continue like this.
U.S. Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because it has not participated in talks about its nuclear plans.
During a seven-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and downplayed the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options to choose from, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such development.
“One of the things that is on my mind is that in the last six years we have learned something from Iraq that is unpredictable to war.”
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a “package of positive and negative incentives” is needed “to convince the Iranian government that it is in reality less protected with nuclear weapons” because “its people will suffer tremendously” from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government joined European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect “credible” consequences if it fails to comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that nuclear technology knowledge is only to be gained for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear program and renounce a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left negotiations on the interim agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees about whether they should commit to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community behind in terms of some of the proposals it had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set the 31st of December as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “suppressing sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, Iran’s representation at the United Nations condemned what it called Thursday “unfounded and unfounded claims” by some Security Council members about Iran’s nuclear activities and said they were ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers “to achieve an appropriate long-term solution.”
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in US plans to reduce US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concern about the imminent troop withdrawal. U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
A change of course in the aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One baby more means a grave more".
They learned these lessons so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course due to the low birth rate and the aging population this summer, encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and definitive: "Not at all."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There’s nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has brought forth two generations of notoriously thick, distorted single children lovingly called “little emperors,” a population crisis is rising in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, according to the UN.
Department of Population Issues is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent by 2020, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older adults accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of capable age need to have babies to “help reduce the ratio of the aging population and alleviate the labour shortage of the future.”
"Shanghai will soon be as old -- but not as rich -- as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step-by-step relaxation
Enshrined in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial decree introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy will face huge fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplaces.
Chinese officials attributed this policy to avoiding the critical use of the country’s natural resources, while human rights officials condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to abort.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many hard slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute of Population Research, said government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with one partner as a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who qualifies for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has sent city employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said there was a boom in the applications of couples who want a second child after the campaign started, the urban districts did not report any change.
As an example, the Huinan municipality with a population of 115,000 still receives only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai community of Caolu, said that financial considerations are likely the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and that is legally allowed.
But they, like many Chinese, only have minor government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsely rate the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem, however, is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the HR manager, said she only wanted a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to caring for others and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old owned by a translation company, said it more bluntly.
For middle-sized parents with double careers, through which the birth rate drops, he said, it’s all about being successful and you have to be selfish.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up seeing their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, poses huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the room question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you must already have a resume for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group develops emission reduction plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- re-emphasized on Friday with the release of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrial nations having to shoulder the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a time-out negotiation as more than 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrialized and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature rise should be that policymakers would support.
The process is given great flexibility, said John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to put the spotlight on what the UN’s leading climate representative, Yvo de Boer, has called “the big picture.”
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which industrialized nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also boosted the talks on Friday by pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change – from overcoming floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks last week.
U.S. Climate Special Representative Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging markets, if these are not financed by industrialized nations.
This move announced that the Obama administration is on a tougher line with China than the Bush administration had two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging markets rising up and taking action, according to Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern made his statement an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei’s statement that the leading American climate negotiator was either lacking “reason” or “highly irresponsible” that he said earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China to cope with global warming.
With the future economic march direction of the great world powers at stake, broken lines have opened up both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle relates equally to saving individual economies, as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the big powers are struggling over who should bear the cost of stopping greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to take more aggressive steps to hold countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although leaders say the talks will at best lead to a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States submitted a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the small island states’ offensive “is exerting political pressure on the entire political process,” partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most of the open issues need to be clarified before the arrival of the leaders of the government to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s Deputy Minister, stepped out of their planes and rushed through the Bella Center’s corridors to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to settle claims that will be negotiated over the next week.
The sheer magnitude of the gathering -- 13,000 people walk in and out of the congress center every day, guitar-playing activists hold night shows making fun of the countries they think betray and sell, and draft contracts are hand-to-hand instead of email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the major ministers are here now and from Wednesday will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
“We’re coming to the top league,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
UK’s first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5 a.m. 13 a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and travel 93 km/h in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transportation, will then be on board the first Javelin Pendulum Service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network faster, more reliable, and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become lively commuter cities, working hours would be drastically reduced, and switching from airplane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road traffic jams.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still pull the brakes on British high-speed railroads.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, will deliver the report on December 30, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which connects London with the West Midlands, will pass urban areas and places where the environmental impact is controversial, with a range of five meters.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, northward-facing high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route guide in which a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
“It seems to be the best functioning option,” said a railroad insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travelers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today just over an hour.
The designs would allow trains to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the UK rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned to allow 400-metre-long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to ride on it.
Up to 18 trains could operate per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal in London would be needed, which could handle 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public advisory and planning measures mean that a final decision will not be made until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would keep the travel time between London and Scotland at over three hours.
This is regarded as a crucial point of departure in order to ensure a change from the plane to the railroad, a guideline for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for mortgage for 75,000-pound orangery of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading lower house member of the Conservatives, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had to build in his home in his constituency.
The party’s prison spokesman, degraded by David Cameron for complaining that members of the lower house must live on “lean rations,” has raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to have an oak plantation built at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The lower house officials approved the requests at the time and they were not challenged by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenses of the lower house members. Last night Duncan said that the requests "could not have been cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the lower house, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby homes have achieved a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expense control center of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he grew a conservatory, which is referred to in the plans as "Orangerie".
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to comment on the increased borrowing of money.
The Committee last month, after an investigation of its expenditure, acquitted him of the violation of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred security for a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 (<0xC2><0xA3>300,000) from his London home to his constituency house, which he bought in 1991, a year before he was elected a member of parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage interest refunded by March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 (€2,000) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during that time, suggesting that the entire increase was used to fund the borrowing of <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 (€85,000).
The normal non-stage RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in May.
Duncan lost his post as a lower house opposition leader in September after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that parliamentarians would live on “lean rations.”
Essentially, working for the state means you have to live on lean rations and how S***e is treated.
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and I am claiming a vanishingly small portion, measured by what belongs.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don’t.”
The parliamentarian, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked in May over his spending, when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before clarifying with the Fees Office that this “could be seen as an exaggerated demand.”
An activist has dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn in the form of a pound sign in protest after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by both the Fees Office and subsequent to it by Legg to increase the value."
He added: “There is no debate about dodging and shrinking or a bending of the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all your believers to admire Brighton's beach hut advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer clergyman of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and hold exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, chairman of the Danish Climate Conference, said the increasing mobilization of the world for the climate is contributing to this, which these demonstrations illustrate that the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, all dressed in black, smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, a reporter for AFP found.
Anti-unrest police officers immediately and without regard, intervened.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their opinion, mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these extremely violent splitting groups that had already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction," and has stressed that about a hundred of them were "still held in the streets on Saturday evening," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in seating position.
The rather peaceful train went from parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the planned speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators came with kisses and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were present.
About 3,000 people, most of them wearing sky blue raincoats, made a first run in Copenhagen in the morning as they followed the call of the Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand redress of the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
“We can’t go on like that and say we have time,” said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, where you can walk, like never before.
For the first time in the history of climatic diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
Member of the European Parliament José Bové, a figure of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate change and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly at risk as a result of warming, has kicked off the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and hid bandanas in which they praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches were held by a few hundred demonstrators to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the 350 network gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "joke".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "joke".
Approximately 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of the South-Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
Voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the local elections, according to the Abkhazian Electoral Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including former President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under full Russian occupation, said his press spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, declared Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have elected Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to a polling station in a school in the capital Soukhoumi to choose a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Bagapch alongside the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to oversee the elections.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, in reference to the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhaz's independence.
“I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations,” said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this threshold, a second round of elections must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where police have arrested about 700 people at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries by 18 December, who are in search of an agreement that is to come into force on 1 January 2013.
From the parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to invade.
A stage was set up to welcome the planned speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators, all dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to hit slices, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-riot police immediately encircled you and intervened carelessly by throwing some of you on the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these extremely violent splitting groups that have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
Around the evening, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin from a paved stone during the incidents in which, according to police, about twenty people were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
“We have the extreme groups under control,” police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said as the helicopters of the law enforcement were circling in the air.
Most demonstrators arriving by train or by their own vehicle from major German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to form a first group, which was to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
“Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the South,” activist Lidy Nacpil told the Philippines’ Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
"We can't say to each other: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo of Benin.
“In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, there are watercourses that you can walk through, which was never the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization opponents has approached environmental protection organizations.
French MEP and globalization critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to “combine climate justice and social justice.” “There is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world.”
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are turning to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to the organizers.
In Manila, a few hundred people, most of them students, dressed in bandanas, have advertised for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters have also gathered in action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered during the demonstrations organized by the "Netz des 350", especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge strongly from the school reform of the Lycées.
The National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du sonnique" that the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the lycées, even if they are not required to be taught in the terminals (12th year of school).
"The students of the Première (11th grade) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," confirms Mr Chatel.
For the minister "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but, on the whole, a concentration "of the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one," he continued, underlining: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lyceans."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven in ten Frenchmen (69%) criticized the state project to delete compulsory teaching in history and geography in Terminal S (12th year of school with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question of restricting the philosophy of the Terminal S programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and unions) had called for protests on Tuesday against the project, which they believe falls victim to the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that in the Master 2 (M2) they undergo a subject-specific aptitude exam at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an admission exam in which their teaching skills are tested.
In addition, they conduct internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued, “If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will achieve even more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
Finally, the minister declared that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed again that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the Ecole Normale Supérieure
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
According to an AFP journalist, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts address the audience for fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions.
You want to do something to reach people and make them feel like they want to learn more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event comes from the name that the students gave to the fish in the basin of the school.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants were selected, also according to their charisma," he said.
"You can talk for hours about global warming, but the core goals can also be outlined in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke freely to about 50 people only with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he underlined, hoping that listeners might learn from it that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Delayed payment : angry prison guards, planned actions
Prison officials’ unions on Friday called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime, whose payments have been deferred to January for budget reasons, are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Prison Officers (FO-Penitentiaire) called on employees, who have no service, to demonstrate in front of the prison on Tuesday morning and to block them in order to draw attention to the “theft of what belongs to them”.
The 3rd Prison Union (CGT-Penitentiaire) called for a “strong mobilization in the various prisons” on which the non-payment of overtime in October, night surcharges and Sunday and holiday surcharges in December is branded as “disgraceful and unacceptable”.
The first prison officials’ union, the Autonomous Federal Prison Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for “general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger.”
The head of the prison and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and not all of it was budgeted, but they guarantee that the remaining demands will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie has sent a letter to the unions of prison officials, in which it is guaranteed that the payment will be made next month.
“I am well aware of the staff’s efforts to keep our detention system functioning and modernizing,” she said in the letter.
"I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate measures to ensure that such a situation, which has arisen due to a lack of assessment of the overtime incurred, does not repeat itself in the future," Ms. Alliot-Marie added.
The December salary is therefore leaner, except for the management staff who receive high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains, for which the "budget constraints" must be imposed.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille is outraged, announcing to boycott "all meetings and convocations" until new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays, if the hours from October to December are still not paid, as well as for their overtime," the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne also threatened.
“At a time when we are being burdened with more and more tasks without recruiting more staff, the attempt to enrich ourselves with the funds of the staff is more than inappropriate,” said the CGT union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, notes the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama believes he always gives Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
US President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has spoken to TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is always distributing better gifts than he gets himself.
In a special show aired on ABC on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will of course also get a gift.
Michelle Obama resolutely rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts: "I gave you beautiful gifts last year," she mocked the president.
"So please," he swore to her, pointing to the first lady's pearl necklace, "And who gave you these?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known television host Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a 10-speed bicycle and also a basketball that his father, which he rarely saw, had brought to him from Kenya on Christmas.
"I remember when my father once visited us for Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from him.”
The first lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operates, RTL confirms he has been put in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles for significant "harm" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated on the night of Wednesday through Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors had found "damages resulting from the surgery of a disc drive" he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that the damage had required a re-operation.
The singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put in an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
However, it wasn’t until after 48 hours that the patient’s condition was a little more certain when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "it appears from certain sources" that after its first operation in Paris, "no drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated on in the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a herniated disc.
The procedure, which was planned for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available Thursday night for comments to RTL.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was admitted Monday to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles due to a subsequent infection following the procedure.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his boyfriend was going through a "deep valley" but he assured that "you don't need to worry" about the rock musician because he is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to sit on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation," Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is curbed".
Mr. Camus also stated that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer’s wife, and he did not feel any particular concern.
Nevertheless, concern for the singer’s health had grown ever since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after crashing on his yacht.
Two months later, to general astonishment, Johnny Hallyday was reported to have had a "small colon cancer surgery", which resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer took up his long "Tour 66" as planned as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer had trouble on stage to move.
It wasn’t until mid-November that the people around him had to deny re-enrollment in the hospital.
Euro-2009/Short track: Bousquet first place over his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday over his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, when polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m of the men's.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to reach after the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganya (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
“You can believe in ever greater, and in this case I said, if the world record is within my reach, I will try.”
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 in the same competition.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he won with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t make a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
USA: Grave at Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tombstone, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates back to the 3rd century AD and has always been valued at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble depicting "four scenes of Dionysus in a sophistical architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president for auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still going on, but this part is certainly what buyers have offered the most so far," Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Emile Zola’s discovery of this acquisition of the marble part goes back a long time.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom at her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, minister in the III French Republic and president of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the database of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been foiled
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to homeland no longer compatible after the coup government rejected the move as unacceptable.
“After a phone call with President Zelaya during the night, everything seems to indicate that there is a disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer,” Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
According to the Immigration Authority, the plane set up by the Mexican government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelayas, has returned to its starting point.
The coup government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to “abdicate” and seek political asylum for him abroad.
The collapsed president refused, however, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcome, acting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a further failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense ... they wanted me to give up," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, where he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and gladly ten years, here I have my guitar, added the collapsed president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with some chords.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, which we can unfortunately not accept because it does not include a request for asylum, said Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the coup government, to the Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had responded in an interview with the channel Telesur, which is based in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, would only be undertaken as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors of an exit Mr. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the overthrown president, who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, whereupon the military there had intensified its deployment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government’s stance.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day of the popular consultation organized by him in preparation for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
Coup President Roberto Micheletti has succeeded in organizing a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial elections, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the congress had massively voted against Mr. Zelaya's return to office until the expiry of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street on the rise, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange on Thursday closed with a high, the figures of the American trade balance testify to a price recovery of the shares of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones rose by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the IPO figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq has risen from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor <0xCC><0x81>s 500 Index was credited with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There’s good news from different industries, FTN Financial’s Lindsey Piegza said.
However, this remains anecdotally under the premise that the market is only focused on "half-full glasses", she moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly fixated on the figures of the American trade balance sheet, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
In contrast, analysts had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of corporate research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen in the past week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average number of new job seekers over the past four weeks has “falled to the low of the year,” Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors said.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of 10-year government bonds rose to 3,482 percent from 3,432 percent on Tuesday night, while the profitability of 30-year government bonds rose to 4,492 percent from 4,408 percent on the evening before.
Cuba: Hundreds of ruling partisans whistle ‘Ladies in White’
A few hundred Cuban-powered partisans on Thursday whistled the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day and thwarted another rally, which temporarily detained a good dozen dissidents.
Around forty "women in white", wives or close political prisoners, were whipped on the open street by government partisans under Raul Castro, just as they were on the march into the center of the capital city to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist confirmed to AFP.
Down with the Yankies!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Living Fidel and Raul!", the authorized partisans chanted with a raised fist to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana the evening before, in which neither injuries nor arrests occurred.
A dozen dissidents in the Vedado district of Havana, on the other hand, were temporarily detained by civilian police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police forces forced dissidents who were bullied by government partisans into civilian vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" have organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "please for the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the list of dissidents has about 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda has a prison sentence of 20 years from his residence.
Mr. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are currently behind bars.
The Cuban authorities perceive the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstrations between militant pro-government fighters and “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of the denigration of rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Madman Kills Eighty-Year-Old with Knife, Leaving 5 Injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and injured five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) late Friday afternoon at peak business time.
According to the interview, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the 80-year-old with two knives in front of or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures.
The old man, born in 1929, is killed in the hospital by the consequences of his injuries, according to an official of the police syndicate Alliance.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he pre-buttoned a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were taken to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured man is in danger of life, as he was apparently affected by vital organs, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman became ill as a result of the events and she was reportedly hospitalized in a "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, was said to have immediately escaped to the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He injured two other passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, while the latter of the two were severe.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said locally Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the union Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including teenagers, are said to have tried to curb the insane, according to the testimony investigated by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties wearing a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They couldn’t do it because the guy was well built, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of house number 61, two city policemen, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knives, according to police reports.
The event took place in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passengers came to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put them in first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old, was injured by cut wounds.
Police officers have finally arrested the man who did not carry identification documents.
The prosecutor’s office of Nanterre has commissioned the district department of the Hauts-de Seine criminal police (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The insane man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
Given his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out that he is admitted to a mental institution.
According to another police source, six police officers took him to the police station in Clichy, where he had been deported.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" like "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the operation".
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for a resumption of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to stop the prosecution of his client, who is currently on trial in his place of residence in Switzerland for a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer for the director of the "pianist", denounced gross prosecution errors at the time of the 1977 trial before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal.
I immediately demand pardon, Mr. Hummel explained, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was commissioned at the time of the trial with the case, “made you run cold on your back.”
According to him, the judge Rittenband, who is now deceased, had discussed with a prosecutor before he gave his verdict, who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved a prison -- which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), especially by the public prosecutor in question, David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared in late September that he had “lied” to the authors of the documentary film.
If the Court refuses to end the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands that a trial be conducted that would allow him to present the evidence for his reasoning.
The indictment, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion to lift the facts laid down by the defendant cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears before the courts.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before the sentence was announced for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be there to attend the trial.”
Do you want to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that escape is a way out?, asks Ms. Asayma.
In their opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus despises his authority."
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even stressed that “there are other escape alternatives.”
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the cessation of the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, once again demanded that the criminal proceedings be lifted.
She recalled that her client would no longer endure being harassed by any resurgence of the Polanski affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this process was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September on the grounds of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise in the dollar and closes without a price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed without a price on Friday in a market torn back and forth between better indicators than expected in the US and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 Index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“Honestly, the market is pretty quiet,” said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
“It remains tightly limited, trading volume has become very small and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.”
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators that "has helped to improve the market view of the solidity of the economic recovery," the analysts of Charles Schwab summed up.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, already two months in a row and far more than expected.
Furthermore, U.S. consumer confidence improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan Index Preview.
However, indexes were slowed by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached its highest level against the euro for two months, "pushing down sectors vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield of the 10-year treasury bond rose by 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday evening and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the previous day.
Election of Miss World in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 Miss World title candidates will pass the last hurdle to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
During this big beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already earned their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were voted Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true turmoil of pleasures.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn was just exceptional.
“I’ve seen a lot of things and I’ve had a lot of experiences,” said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, starting at 5 p.m.
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss is now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, the dream of every woman to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates parade in traditional costumes and not to forget, in swimsuit.
The performance will be presented by a television presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, the former beauty queen of South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss World committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is known to receive the world with a hardly surpassing kindness and pride, assures Julia Morley, chair of the Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, went on a safari tour of the famous township in Soweto, but this time they took a bike and tasted the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them their hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Her most beautiful memory, however, is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote a little more for this event.
I'm dealing with people I'd probably never be able to approach otherwise.
I’m sure to return to the 2010 World Cup, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in hospital there for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane, arriving shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 CET) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "quickly" go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation on a disc in Paris on November 26.
The singer was put into an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and to be able to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was put in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for a subsequent bacterial infection following a disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo surgery again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last procedure.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer from AFP noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatological Surgery at H<0xC3><0xB4>pital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles hospital on Monday.
The producer has heavily burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had carried out the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely outraged, Mr. Camus said.
I’ve heard that they may be initiating a legal process, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "traveled to Los Angeles too fast and with the permission of the Paris surgeon".
I had a personal phone call with this doctor, who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblematic, which had surprised me very much, since I myself already have two disc surgeries behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he told RTL that the singer apparently left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist environment.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for unsuccessful operations and not to mention for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Medical Association, has described him as "a man without scruples" who has to "regularly" answer before the board of directors of the chamber and is "anything else than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He said the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "calls no bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been escalating since last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is clear that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) party alliance becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to no longer use its seal
The party alliance, overseen by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou's MoDem party, reacted fiercely on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, the party formerly founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the leader of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and urged him under threat of prosecution to stop using the seal on any document.
Hervé Morin is publicly announcing his intention to take over this UDF seal because he believes that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to reinforce his efforts, he had received the support of Member of Parliament Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF trade mark because he was the first to apply for this trade mark at the "Institut national de la propriété industriel" in 2004.
However, the office of the party alliance UDF supervised by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrous’ friends broke the silence and made it clear that they did not allow themselves to be expropriated and set a deadline for the minister and the deputy, under threat of prosecution, to no longer use this seal and transfer to it the proprietary rights of the mark.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take the UDF seal++, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement + Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF +, printed on your political material and on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, UDF’s headquarters said, urging NC to “immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from all material and from (its) website.”
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the proprietary rights of the trade mark to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring a lawsuit against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to found the party "UMP".
According to the signatories, the Nouveau centre party therefore has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They continue to recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 approved the three-year accession to the MoDem party and the establishment of a branch to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "at the time when he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but the UMP.
He profits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the absence of depositing the acronym UDF to carry out this for himself.
You also point out that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a criminal offence, and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us more dignified in politics as well as in life to make a name for ourselves instead of trying to get out of anonymity by deceitfully acquiring a name on which you have no legal claims whatsoever."
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier convicted of exploitation of weakness
The court of Nanterre on Friday decided to judge artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as billionaire Liliane Bettencourt’s daughter claims, he exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to sneak in part of their fortunes.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be held accountable on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness in court, a crime punishable by a maximum imprisonment of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are bound and at the same time have the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire in their hands.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly carried out by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions presented during the investigation by the prosecutor's office of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to submit a report before March 10, 2010, in which you clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I will talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, which you have to protect, he reaffirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having used her mother’s weakness for years to sneak in a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted being manipulated by the photographer she regards as a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit filed by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ pleadings on Friday led to a major family debacle.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer appealed to three letters sent to her notary by her client (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she mistrusted Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Can you please explain to my daughter that for fifteen years I wrote to Banier once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise since her marriage.”
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre once again believes that the plaintiff had no right to respond in this way, in particular because a guardian’s judge has in recent days refused her application to initiate judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legally capable, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place,” prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney said.
The Court has now decided to issue a judgment after the trial for the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager Revolution or the end of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for the staff to join "values" determined the best as it was formerly to impose on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By placing the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to separate products factors to impose customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that particularly affects employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&E and, more crucially, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique) demands “a proactive approach and a forward-looking outlook from all parties involved”; it claims from the employees an operation that the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we call for an operational revolution that would consist in putting employees at the center of the company’s concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The very conditional benefit of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, like the questionnaire Orange submitted to its payees, spur this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, unfortunately not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure is finally about to do primarily what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a greatly simplified idea of human behavior.
Coming from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt through intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory recently reactivated by the American “neurosciences” and unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the “leverage” (sic) for employee engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos, published by Le Figaro.fr, strengthens leaders in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into every consideration or practice of management: for wage recipients, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take this conception of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a predefined Doxa that allows them by their perceived image of the company to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resource management back in the right place.
Thus, they create a fertile soil that is favorable for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo Speech: the “just war” brings praise to Obama from the right
U.S. Right welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo on Friday and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the notion of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who mocked the award to Obama on Oct. 9, this time applauded the president’s speech, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin explained the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today, adding that she herself had raised the topic of a “sometimes necessary” war in her memoirs just published.
War is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, sought to justify the use of violence in Oslo on Thursday; a way to declare his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “very good work” in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, rejoiced the former president of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, I felt this speech quite as historical, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, said he was pleased to have seen a “Left-wing president” who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they “would not be free and could not hand over a prize for peace if the use of violence did not exist.”
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama held “a very American speech.”
In addition to portraying himself as a “cosmopolitan,” as “he always does,” he “spoke like an American president” when he pointed out that Europeans “live in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and for whose protection they do not do much,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, a hawk of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as “boring, uplifting and uninspired.”
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama is defending the use of the armed forces.
If the war is packaged under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocent can be justified quite simply, he warns.
However, the media of the moderate left continues to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, called the address itself a "monumental work" for a speaker like him, known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo “offers a schedule to manage international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression,” the California daily excites.
The New York Times believes that Obama “proclaimed the necessary discourse” and describes his speech as “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Long-distance drivers: Three marathons for an agreement to secure supplies for Christmas
After a three-week marathon of negotiations, the unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening to put an end to the strike order and the imminent severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, State Secretary Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in hopes of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting angry.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement and only at 6:00 p.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have done a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
“It’s not a lot, but we’re starting small,” said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed to stop blocking the supply centers.
"There will probably always be some rebels who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to concede these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on this on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs by 3% and for the maintenance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the issue of the 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the drop in taxes for employers of 100 million euros" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 bill on amended finances, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is calling for an "identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to this organization, and then, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour, to apply to the entire profession.
This will be the case “in no time,” Bussereau assured.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR denounced a "deceptive trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to exhaust the goose-eaters on the coming Christmas days, laments the Unostra.
For the Otre association, the agreement "threatens to dig a large grave for the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest highway network in France for the Paris area and the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of the strike between the trade unions and the leadership of the RATP (Independent Paris People’s Transportation Administration) keeps the strikers waiting with their demands for wage surcharges.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10 am and 8 pm. On the Central Route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was ready for use and outside the Central Route only one of four trains.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, forcing the passengers to change.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is striving to connect the major stores in a traffic-technical way".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains went scheduled at peak traffic time, and almost none during low traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no human sensation on the platforms, as the residents of the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly due to the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), said he would have been extra "a half hour earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to passengers by staff and law enforcement officials, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line arrived or departed in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut via the station of Saint-Lazare to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers took place again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific elaboration of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a long-due pay surcharge.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself put its wage surcharge proposals in brackets, stressing that the leadership "is unable to solve a problem, while this was possible for long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP clarified that a new meeting for the "comprehensive review of working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers searched the office of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership who had so far rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after calming down the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after a warning from Unsa and Independents.
The associations demand a pay surcharge of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents). In addition, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, where millions of travellers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of work experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a pay surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party, a decision immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to greatly complicate the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become "a place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," according to the president of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> four days after the ruling.
According to Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, the decision was unanimously taken by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political action for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders said before the ruling that parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than meet as nonpartisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a 2007 trial by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court, Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, accusing the DTP of following the “instructions” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Ankara and many other countries regard as a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assured that it had “no connection” to the PKK, but refused to call it a terrorist organization and called on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court is between the government, which strives to meet the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, to dry up the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reiterate that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP’s premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The ordering forces used tear gas grenades and water throwers as the demonstrators began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the ruling, Türk assumed that the court’s decision “will deepen despair even further.”
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish editorial) issue by means of a ban on a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
“We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
That doesn’t solve the problems,” said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
“This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening that has been promoted by the government,” said Ahmet Island, a political market observer.
“You can obviously get ready for a reaction from the PKK,” he added.
On Thursday, the PKK confessed to an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crunchy winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
Instead, so that its employees can try out and learn to master the entire vehicle technology.
For the first time this weekend, meteorologists say.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over the world in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-tracks are taken with large-scale scattered vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, main traffic and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at three in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES starts at three o’clock at night, “so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts”.
It will be difficult if it does not snow until 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scattered vehicles".
Only afterwards, if it does not snow further, are feeder and development roads, including the Rat-Ail-Straße, in turn.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o’clock in the morning, the footmen of the FES set off on their way, and hazardous points and transitions were first cleared.
The FES can usually not take care of all cycling routes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges from 10 p.m. to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is on this fast smoothness, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the scatterer is on the way.
If necessary, they are also called by the police.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-long animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s journal Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
He shows us a lot about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they gathered the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund Confirms Theories About Early Dino History
The name Tawa comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, usually you can find only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts don’t necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the allocation of these ancient dinos is usually controversial.
For example, experts are debating when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, which are known as "long-necked" species.
After analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa halle is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacks, as they also possess the descendants of theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacks, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three lines of development separated early on and spread from South America over all parts of the world, which at the time still formed a single land mass as the supercontinent Pangaea.
The team, along with Tawa, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn palaeontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could emerge, because in South America simply many primitive dino fossils have been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptilian tribe to the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the Earth's Middle Ages is still mysterious.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while the kinship died at the border from the Trias to the Jura.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs randomly survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to bloom, which had also developed in the Trias and since then has frozen a shadow existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, or Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is beating waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers from Goethe University, but also from universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America stand in solidarity with the protesting students on Campus Westend.
In a statement in German and English, they “disapprove” the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the building occupied by students and faculty in the educational strike last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damages, the signatories say, did not justify the "violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The eviction constitutes an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and distracts from the contents.
The Bureau has refrained from the necessary discourse.
Teachers call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage, it says.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Association also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s future, says Verdi youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Hesse’s science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the uni-president and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a recent hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden state parliament.
We understand the protest, but we don’t understand vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left viewed this differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they were cleared.
The Left has filed a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a tightly guarded site for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow’s Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and the Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, and Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is home to major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronics Technology, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaya Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the wooded hills in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the laying down of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital into a chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head railway stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were then considered traffic-related fossils of the 19th century, which acted like brake blocks of modern rail traffic, since it once took a great deal of time to reload locomotives from the back to the front.
Driving in, holding short, driving on - that's how it's supposed to go.
And that’s why the bus stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station located about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava on the Trans-European Railway Magistrale – that’s why the slogan of the “heart of Europe” stands.
S21 is actually being addressed now, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities it is almost priceless to implement the lowering.
Head railway stations no longer have an entry and exit problem, however, since there are modern turning trains with trains and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 along with the ICE-Neubaustrecke to Ulm is now being approached.
Local and local governments have done it.
Railways are participating, also because the risks of the Republic’s largest individual infrastructure project are borne by taxpayers and not by state corporations.
The project can still be reasonably justified in terms of urban planning.
New urban space is created, which is equipped with a lot of green - you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, which was attributed to enormous growth - typically in the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition from low-cost airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening freight transport, as transport by rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by trucks on the road.
However, the new construction line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly involves many other railway projects.
Six billion euros will be invested in Swabia.
This is the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade money will be lacking at other nodes and constraints in the network.
A total of sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180 kilometer long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built at a slow motion.
It would be urgent to press on the tube right here.
However, S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the airport’s decision
The state government has left open in Wiesbaden’s Landtag whether it will go into review against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally examine the more than 400-page VGH judgment, said Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had justified in writing on that day that in the case of the construction of the planned Northwest Railway at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as provided by the state government, is not compatible with the legally required protection of the population from nocturnal air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether to review the ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises of a night flight ban, otherwise this would be considered a "word break".
It’s damn hard to keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP’s voting slogan, “We keep the word.”
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel that the state government is still trying to get to its night flights with "right-wing twisting and trickery".
An accurate legal examination takes your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a “quick first impression”.
We need a legally certain decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As she portrays the opposition, his group’s statements on the night flight ban have never been.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-ridden US big banks are stripping off their state bonds.
The Bank of America on Wednesday repaid aid from the Tarp bank bailout fund for a total of $45 billion (a good 30 billion euros) at a stroke.
Citigroup is also planning to reimburse state aid, according to a report by CNBC.
The institutes want to get rid of the restrictions that came with the acceptance of the money – such as limiting the payment of manager bonuses and paying high fees.
The Bank of America had secured $19 billion worth of fresh money from investors over convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled by sales, among other things.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection helped through a very difficult time.
The bank had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the takeover of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money from the capital market in order to release its liabilities to the state.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman did not want to speak out.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid back their aid.
Fast choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had forced the incumbent editor Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the personnel.
Favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role not to further harm the ZDF director Markus Schächter, should this proposal not pass to the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote has not yet been determined at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's withdrawal was a near-defeat for Schächter, but an expected one.
Because the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
He had organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender, the news broadcasts of the ZDF had lost access quotas, he rejected another term of office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
Recently, even 35 state lawmakers had interfered in the debate, who regarded Koch’s approach as unconstitutional.
It didn't help.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
Afterwards he worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, initially the "today-journal".
Subsequent posts: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morning Magazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit following the de-election of Brender, who was voted journalist of the year by the media magazine on Wednesday.
Koch’s counterpart in the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, declared last week that the countries should amend the ZDF state treaty in such a way that the intendant’s proposals for personnel cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender’s expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the board of directors with a wise move – by sharply criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate Schächter without loss of face for the post of editor-in-chief as well as to elect the board of directors without being suspicious of putting a partisan in office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is allocated to the left-liberals anyway.
Studying is scrambled
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strike, the Ministers of Culture of the Länder finally steered on Thursday: At a meeting of Ministers of Culture and Rectors of Higher Education Conference, both sides agreed to want to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to complete their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the test burdens: basically, each study module should only conclude with a single exam.
In addition, the workload of students is to be checked and "a realistic and reasonable measure" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries pledged to make common structural requirements for bachelor’s and master’s degree programmes more flexible.
In addition, there should be no deviating country regulations.
Less Examinations
Since the start of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have been holding the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
It was filled with concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation board decided to reduce the number of exams in part drastically: "Each module usually ends with only one exam", it says in a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of degree programmes.
With the "significant reduction of the examination burden", explained the chairman of the accreditation board, Reinhold Grimm, was to stop a "mis-development that significantly impaired the studyability."
In addition, "studieability" should in future be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content should be "strengthened to check" whether "unnecessary adjustments of the students in the choice of
Events should be avoided.
The students would have “demand to receive scope to enable and promote self-initiative.”
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses, but also to the review of existing courses of study.
These must be “reaccredited” every five years – but this means that it will take until 2015 for all degree programs to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies nationwide are responsible for this, which are subject to the accreditation council established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture urged the countries to "strongly" act on the agencies in such a way that the filling of substances is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on corresponding measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has allocated additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
This money is primarily intended to be used by universities to set up tutoring programmes and to strengthen study counseling as well as examination and foreign offices.
The government and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a amendment to the Higher Education Act in Parliament.
After this, only one exam is required for the completion of a study model.
The design of studies is to be more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of certificates of achievement at other universities and facilitating access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, all courses in the country will be checked for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso University Groups demanded that the design of the education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, students should now also be involved as affected "one word".
The future academics received support from the President of the Higher Education Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The trade union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor’s degree access to a further master’s degree.
On the other hand, the countries have to ensure that there will be enough master’s degrees with the best possible study conditions for today’s generation of undergraduate students tomorrow, says GEW Board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on a free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and leaving is almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner, in which he discusses the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his space.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Werner Söllner had initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
In 1993, he held the legendary Frankfurt Poetry lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable out-of-literary appreciation last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, which dealt with "German Literature in Romania in the Mirror and Zerr Mirror of its Securitate Acts".
Söllner read a statement before Romanian-German writers Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, in which he admitted his cooperation as IM for the Romanian intelligence agency Securitate.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts would have begun sneakyly, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted intimidation attempts by the Securitate sufficiently."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that identifies the abyss and lowliness of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
According to Söllner’s confession to the literary scientist Michael Markel, IM Walter had played a role in his securitate file and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter on him.
He had "cut him out" in all the points that were difficult for him at the time, Markel said.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
However, Söllner’s statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, completely surprising is not the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July, after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The people affected, it may be suspected, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the nicknames Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the very procedurally reliable sighting of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacies of Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic enlightenment has been deceived and hindered in recent years.
A National Council on the Processing of Securitate Records (CNSAS) was not established until 1999 by the Birthler-Authorities, but the publication of the files has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of files.
The influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar expressed dismissively about the winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power here meant to be able to express itself quite unveiled in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, inevitable questions are linked to the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with concealed debt.
The sensible reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the urge for knowledge than by blame and shame.
The genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just an adrenaline-dressed field serviceman coming from a very nice Christmas party where a sports goods manufacturer had distributed goodies when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment manufacturer, climbed into a so-called C-class a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the distinctive baldness got chauffeured because of the city still strange to him.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol wasn't in the game after all, and drunk with luck wasn't the 55-year-old either.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work will continue.
Or just really start.
In the words of the Swiss committed only three days earlier: "While we have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The “much more important task” is ahead on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the royal class performance in the league everyday in Mainz.
And the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three goals by Marica (5th), Trasch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw (game)
The Champions League 8th Final (Intro 16/17 + 23/24 February/ Reverse 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy over the dazzling arrival of the Babbel successor remained thus distracted.
Not only the alleged salvation bringer, who had imparted the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, dedication and playfulness.
I approached the players and told them to reflect on their strengths, and I encouraged them to be more courageous, explained Seelenklempner Gross the simple-sounding recipe for success that under therapist Babbel had no longer had any effect.
He has ignited some magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "When a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamics, advanced to the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new superior: "He is a man who embraces and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel, it was obviously lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs Constance above all.
Like Gross, players and managers were careful not to overestimate the victory against a weakened and completely overwhelmed defence of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before the bad awakening had come four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4, Khedira said.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that while one season goal was reached, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt celebrated his 40th birthday, even after his first home win in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were freshly revived in the form of a television interview broadcast by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of directors of leadership weakness and had decided to change the coach under pressure from puberting fans.
Lehmann also considered that his free day after games had been cancelled as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and displeasure.
Lehmann’s statements were “characterized by pure selfishness,” Heldt wedged back and announced consequences for the finalist.
I don't think they're gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, however, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the replaced coaching team, the playful and combatively strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a large part of the success," Heldt and Lehmann said unisono - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Cup-fight in heavyweight
Hot duel in Bern: Kevin Johnson challenger repeatedly provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC version.
The judges’ ruling was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work out with the K.O. that everyone was expecting.
Klitschko built his record to 39 victories in 41 professional battles, having to give up twice due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th match.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2.02-metre-long Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left-hand leader.
The 11-centimeter Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly evaded the beatings of the world champion, so Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some vortices before the battle in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
As he weighed, the champion was then provoked Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Clitschkos's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth match after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After nearly four years off, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had to give up without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I only got one hit in this fight and I’m physically in very good shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
David Haye, however, is wearing the WBA belt after he unthroned the 2.13-metre Nikolai Waluyev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September this summer.
Its promotional company is reportedly already planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Greens leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has deliberately deceived.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two tanker trains in September was "knowingly untrue," Greens leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It’s called commonplace: he lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protective Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the kidnapped trucks, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people had been killed or injured in the US airstrike requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have endorsed this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor’s Office has not influenced specific operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the Ministry’s presentation on the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert had also become loud.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs informed correctly and completely about the background of the tank truck attack.
It had officially announced that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, it was reported that they had even pointed to several reports by the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document by commanding Colonel Klein and a hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, it says.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified by the Bundestag's committee of inquiry, which is set to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dreamworlds
Some see images in an awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in mentally ill people and in drug addiction that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are allowed to indulge ourselves unbridled in the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic states, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world are usually considered crazy or drug addicted, at least as a special thing.
However, such images and voices do not only arise in mentally ill people or in drug addiction.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, insanity and reality blur.
Dream-changed awake-consciousness states can occur in the most varied forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the brain’s neural messengers – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine – derails and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and insane thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection of insanity and dream has been employed by philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 a "great resemblance of being mad with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies of such a sense".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. transforms into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he hovers on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him are winged devilish shapes with blood red, distorted frits, flickering teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Noisy, malicious voices rage out of walls and radio.
He can no longer tolerate the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables out of the stereo, knots them into a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a loudspeaker and puts the loop around his neck.
- Jump.
The snare loosens.
That should be a lesson for you, the voices shout in a drum-skin-breaking choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, he is taking medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst anxiety and deepest despair, he says.
The deceptions are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in a lifetime, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common condition after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, patients can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they fall into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, magnitude, relationship or persecution.
Especially common is the listening to voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
Reality perception in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician of the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenia is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
They are usually unable to reconcile reality, the deceptions are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, “but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved.”
The insane thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain hits caprioles, researchers still puzzle.
Exceptions can cause any person to temporarily lose their reference to reality, Fuchs says.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a mystery how the disorder of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis when the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains are hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get them, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether deceitful images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and deceptions for the past ten years, last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The unreal world in our heads".
Although hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, they are also associated with astonishingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and cerebral trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brains of healthy people are hallucinating.
Hallucinations, according to boxes, consist of memory contents that are usually retained.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or insufficiently inhibited; when our brains are running hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also stimulating, stress, love grief or other mental states of emergency.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
In the break, it may happen that a slick boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
When it answers him, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to him.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
“Am I crazy?” she asks herself sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other deceitful images are not real and disappear again.
At night the apparitions are usually scary
Often the deceptions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material, because the teacher is just introducing a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations to everyone else, both audibly and visibly, on the board.
At night, the appearances are usually scary.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which comes too rarely and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreams of whether the images she sees, the frizzes or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don’t tell her about it, they would think she’s crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist Kasten on the internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Delirium is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from stimulation, they are very likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain is then under-busy and provides for its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a young girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Dad, since she can think, is not her physical father.
With visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same areas of the brain are active, which also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K., to distinguish deceptions and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, which is why they look so real."
Even nighttime dream images consider Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their misconceptions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to value hallucinations as a special ability.
Border State Between Dream and Hallucination
In our overly consciousness-centered world, imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, distressing disease, but it also holds positive, creative – madness is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of dream-changed waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state afterwards.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self-loss and world loss, for example, by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intense form of meaningful foundation and meaningfulness in an inherently unbearable situation, which allows us human beings our own ability not to perish in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, while his body is sentenced to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunges into a self-made world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make drugs from blood.
When taken by a Greek on a motorcycle to his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the pine snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
It goes completely on in the imaginated happening, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travels are still clear to me after years and in side-by-side details.
More clearly and intensely than actually experienced.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other life experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug rush show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are also in the watch.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new editor-in-chief Kallen is an intermediate solution: In the long term Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to be 100% owned by the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm willingness to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have regulated the details of this as a precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only afterwards.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to introduce 7,500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
It kills the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would retire from the chairmanship of the board from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
Later, the Treasury division was responsible for the company’s assets and after Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure also for direct marketing, foreign markets, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," says Burda.
The holding company should remain 100% owned by the family in the future, Burda said.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies are not sure of the collapse: "This was always about families who were infected by a capital addiction, who have completely speculated and thought that they could thus rise to a very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had “never had world power dreams,” Burda said.
I don’t see myself as the political precedent of this country as it was Springer, and I don’t want to play in the world league with ‘Time’, these stores have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least that’s what El Corte Inglés has envisioned, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the Callao (Madrid) mall, where it’s all about personal care.
In the spa area, which is located on the eighth floor, you can find other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide hair removal with lasers; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" with eight friends on your feet and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many options Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, in addition there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
A training session begins with the input of a personal password on a touchscreen that is opposite the devices.
After that, various videos show you how to perform your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are completely enough to train the body muscles.
And then, if you want to visit the hair salon after training your body, Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments to regain hair splendor, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this spa in the heart of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and therefore it is once again a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The “LIVE Office” will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility through management, coordination, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and summarize the opinions and actions of the sectors employed in it.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electrical Cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework contract is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those activities that are related to energy and in particular to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative Endesa participates in to promote the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups throughout Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the automotive sector
President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero prophesied that the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country’s largest exporter, would be “a horizon of tranquility”.
At the presentation of the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the actions that the government has initiated in support of the automotive sector over the course of the governmental year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the auto industry, we would have a panorama of the neglect and closure of some of our main production plants today," he said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automakers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the growth of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Overall Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), provided €800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn led to investments of more than €3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended for both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to boost demand, referring to Plan 2000E, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and automobile manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows the emission of new vehicles sold in the Spanish market to be reduced by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which rose "by 40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classical Automotive Fair, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines, will be held in Madrid.

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on a specially designed race track outside the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is perfectly compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, dubbed i-Stop, on the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out with its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All of these aspects are "very good" on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
In addition, the steering wheel's game is excellent.
Further looking at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, one can see that Mazda is in line with the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the striking colors red and blue.
This style reminds us partly of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can easily be said that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to outperform.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can drive at first comfort by car.
To all of this comes a large and clearly shaped luggage compartment.
So far, the stop and startup system is only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real pleasure and stands out for its subtlety, quiet noise, performance and low consumption.
And all those who don’t drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-Stop with petrol engine because of its great gearing comfort and low fuel consumption, even if at Mazda especially the diesel models are the best-selling.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model, which was selected for the test drive, is a special feature because it has a considerably larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the standard equipment stands out above all the assistant for the change of lanes (RVM), which eliminates the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensors, the blue and bluetooth.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which includes the following for an additional 1,500 euros: among other elements, especially the learning Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative about this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the model Sportive.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day new driving pleasure.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red teppich of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as they are sexy, shone more than ever.
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is first limited, a device with which you can only read your emails without a way to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five-minute fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is still of interest especially to young people.
In contrast to smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success of this, the company has launched two new devices: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free service for data, quite unlike the peek, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data to be able to read your emails once you have crossed the national border or when you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of flat rate roaming is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to be able to read all the small prints.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming rates across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (while it’s always amazing that it’s called Fon, although it doesn’t have Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi) can offer this type of tariff means that phone providers need to slowly but safely rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without vegetation and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, namely when you buy, and not month by month.
And that’s exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase option with lifetime internet access as Peek already offers in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more suitable model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish Color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already upon the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and coat of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him at his, without doubt, second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models on both occasions: apart from the fact that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and she was wearing something large-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than just one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration she wore a dress made of lace and in Oslo a velvet patterned.
The accessories were also different: the first time, green shoes with half-heeled heels and the second time, although a weighty model, but gold-colored.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, the previous she wore her hair open.
75% of working mothers have problems at work due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fruchtbarkeit und Karriere von Frauen in Spanien", carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market limited because of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether or not the women work and if so, what type of profession they practice.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-days or do not have a fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a fixed job, especially in the public sector, postpone the formation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after reunification, a number that rises to 4.1 years for women with a fixed job who have taken longer to achieve this and who have only realized their reunification and the first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar with regard to the willingness to conceive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account at the age of women at the time of marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also observed in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only a primary school degree or a higher education, became mothers for the first time, on average, with 25.1 or 32.1 each.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with a major degree get married before their first permanent job and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do it exactly differently and only seek a permanent job and marry afterwards and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the popular slogan "Because you are worth it".
The lead actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous hallmark as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's actress colleague in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to speak in the fashion world.
Her highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They all appeared on that occasion.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and their daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Asses" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) to the three hundred X-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearful genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a similarity to the burning heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save on horrors or illuminations.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
On reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I always felt without having found words for it: joy in contrast to miserable fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife that would almost have killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was enthralled by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery merged with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in coming to heaven on the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, one of the 8,000 peaks in world literature, you have to climb the north wall, the wall where the best mountaineers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny chew.
He sometimes said about himself that he would be the heir of a landowner of the county and again other times he said that he would be the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams bear witness to a certain magnitude."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer picked up the insane scream that was shouted from a bridge from Munich by that personality, so that his echo would sound in his own way until the night of the 20th century. He did this on a journey on which he fled from himself and with a speech full of violence to the worms.
One day she knelt down and bedded: “My dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman.”
On his grave are these verses engraved by Spencer: 'Sleep after effort, / after the storm of the harbour, / tranquillity after war, / after a rich life, you will find delight in death.'
Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII spied on them between the azaleas or the birds sang in Greek.
There is no other known case where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic, whose literary talent was much greater than her madness.
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do but try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not lead Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What, then, did Cela do except to destroy that man’s glory, so that he could put himself on this podium?”
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 came along next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixed dog that we took out of the shelter and weighs just six kilograms, and then out of the blue they missed him two kicks and seriously injured him.
Our indignation cannot be put into words at all, because it is incomprehensible to us, because where the fun is to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course executed on the leash.
In addition, the suffocation attack, which a woman who walked comfortably, when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he will perhaps do the same with a woman, a child, an older master, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident took place in a normally quiet neighborhood at 5 p.m. on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we reported in a nearby police station, but we still have great doubts about whether this will bring anything at all and in order to prevent any prejudices from the start, we just want to clarify that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our outrage at what happened has prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what needs to be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal, on an animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “encompasses far more than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming safer with each day” and reaffirmed that it also contributes to getting closer to this goal with other pedagogical and informative actions every day.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, they are always committed to one of their main goals must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is rising again
After almost two years, the car market for vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to figures presented by the manufacturer's association Anfac and the car dealer's association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are only to be taken with great caution at the moment, as the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a 60% decrease over the previous year.
However, it should be borne in mind that, apart from the increase last month, the total registrations for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales of the previous fiscal year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all the vehicles that make up the small van market: departures from passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter small trucks / passenger cars.
Furthermore, the same clouds of thunder in the sky still affect demand the most, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the bulk of the sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
These constraints, which are the result of the banks' turned money, must be included in other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama, and unlike passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a Plan 2000E vehicle has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, self-employed people and small businesses also have a right to it if they want to buy a van up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission that cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometer driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded us that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to also pay special attention to these small trucks and, of course, also to the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The auto dealer association predicts a similar year for 2010 to the previous year, for which it expects a 19% sales drop (in passenger cars and off-road cars).
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the anti-lock braking system ABS and as is happening now with the stability control ESP, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergencies must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already compulsory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the remaining vehicles a waiting period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The action adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many crashes on the road.
The task of the emergency braking assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects on the brake pedal on the basis of the braking strength performed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, acts with maximum force into the braking system, thereby reducing the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would be even fewer accidents - one expects that one in four accidents could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
When the driver responds, the system helps to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors Postpones Plan for Opel to January
While the workforce at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it needs more time to bring the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants the affected side to give their consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
In contrast, GM is assured that it will make a decision regarding the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American carmaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers might be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which has the support of the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more popularity.
In the event that none of these buyers agree, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
The engineers used the Boxster S as the basis for the development of their latest and most expensive jewel, and they really managed to make it 80 kilograms lighter, with which it now only weighs 1,275 kilograms.
In order to achieve this, they first dispensed with the automatic fold-up roof, which was replaced by a tent screen roof with manual drive, so that you saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by eliminating the air conditioner again 13; in addition, the fuel tank has been slightly reduced from 7 to 64.
Then the CDR-30 audio system dropped another six kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles to reach the missing kilogram.
Although it is also available with the dual-clutch PDK transmission, the test drive was carried out with a 6-speed manual transmission vehicle, mainly on the smaller California shorelines, on mountain tracks that were really very curved.
In his driving behavior you can only give him the note flawlessly.
However, the reduction of its weight did not in any way lead to the fact that it would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is more the opposite of the case: for a long time we have not been driving such a small and light model, which at the same time gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gear in the necessary time until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again...
The car does everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all flavours
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been extremely successful and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, whether standing out or accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads we were driving on with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the punchholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and that, although we found some of these curves at dawn and roll splitting in the morning.
To sum up, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as it is usually rather rare and it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be released in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl.
The singer, a busty friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and an occasional star on the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her nasty face with the same stiffness of her neck as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many fancy players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra, reaching first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight triples of the best of his team rating.
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of dedication and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 triples rated contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Reds, who sat at the top of the scoreboard from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from <0xC3><0x81>lava opted for an internal match of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" rating of splitters already guessed that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was not decided yet and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of Elias" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in the yellows turning the wheel (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with safety to get air again and suddenly came to one of them the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, which with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the scoreboard again the third quarter of the (54-67) was displayed with the calming distance of the hosts.
The Alaveses were blocked in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they honestly deserved in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team back by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splitters were put off because of fouls, Ivanovic’s team did not give up, defended well, and although the Israelis were still catching up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to give up the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, in a game that was characterized by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoor game, which facilitated the victory of the Greeks.
The team from Málaga was not afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship or of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
The Andalusians started dreaming in their first quarters, with an aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinding the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the first Unicaja, even though the local team with an indoor game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to get the scoreboard in the 13th minute to indicate 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which it was almost disqualified due to an action between the two Americans Beverleys and Williams and we would have been disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to get warm and his superiority in both halves, while the departure of the English Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez left clear traces at the Unicaja.
Among their indoor players and Lithuanian precursor Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A hunt was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, who proved superior despite his 19 losses and even managed to make up the difference of the game played in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the leadership within the group to shake.
Unicaja tried to dismiss the many failures and the departure of Scotsman Robert Archibald injured during the game.
Despite the many downsides for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to the spring guidance and triples of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was again some hope of 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with inches within the basket range, could not be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give up and had to give up the lead at Olympiacos.
How Much Should You Earn From Your Facebook Profile?
Thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads for real estate, jobs and cars in Spain, Facebook users can now learn their salary that they should earn based on their profile.
The "How Much Should You Earn?" tool calculates users' salaries based on more than 140,000 job vacancies at Trovit in Spain. Users can use a form on Facebook to enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average feels "lowly paid", explains the Trovit product manager, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the lowest paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives a gross annual salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
Accordingly, a truck driver has a net annual salary of 34.247 euros in England, 25,751 euros in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros annually net; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, if his term of office officially expires
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the embassy in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, as his mandate expires on that day and he has to find a new place to stay."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the set date: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
This week, however, he sought refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed because of Zelaya’s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the “de facto” government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the predominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debts with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly leave the liquidity free hand at interest rates that move around zero so that banks would buy assets for billing.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost complete and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are beginning to spill some sand into the gear, as the ECB has already announced with its annual auction, which will take place next week.
That is why investors doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks and public debt was rising again.
The focus is now on quality again and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the eurozone and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability so far, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding the valuation of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not hurt in order to silence the defenders of moral risk, who had once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for world economic policy for what they had caused, since it had slowed down the devastating effects to which the restriction of loans had led to the loss of jobs.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai suggests a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and development in Greece has been predicted earlier.
A government that conceals the state debt, elections and a new government that draws on the same thread.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin saves Hungary from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allows a euro member country to no longer meet its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to involve its citizens in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some misappropriations to too high amounts, that would now be within the scope of expectations.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences are reduced and the Spanish increase further, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
This by Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, which again fails to come up with a long Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, despite the long-term warning of the Spanish economy.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment "caution when driving" is required.
Connected branches
Iberdrola’s chairman, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before Parliament’s subcommittee yesterday, where Spain’s energy supply strategy for the next two decades is being debated these days.
After his appearance, followed by Gas Natural-Fenosa chairman Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion euros from that date to 2030, on the condition that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy generation capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020, the question will change and you should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with facilities for collecting carbon dioxide and, of course, above all on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the prerequisite, of course, by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the proposed sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, in no way wanted to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction is clearly set, despite some "individual" actions, as the chairman of Iberdrola called it.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions should be made now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework needs to be set up to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The Swiss Swiss port, Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-based airport services, is the preferred partner of the Irish flu company Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where it is represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have yet been announced, is planned for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol of cooperation to create an innovation center for smart infrastructures yesterday.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million euros by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to study energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A five-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city government wants to complete the construction by the end of 2014.
After the administration had decided on a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll office administration.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the investment is estimated at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with the final phase competing three consortia, mainly consisting of European construction companies.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure, and the French Bouygues group, competes against the Acciona team.
The third and final consortium, which is in the closer choice, is called the LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises massive construction work and privatizations, but has a hurdle to overcome, as you only get access by buying a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona relies on this geographical area of utmost importance for the industry, where it is already very well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies tasked with building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll line, which is funded by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link, is intended to connect the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) over a length of 5 kilometers through tunnels. This is the largest road from Brisbane to take the road.
The roadmap issued by the city administration provides for the awarding of summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll line is expected to open for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland contributes 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the financing.
For Hochtief, Brisbane is already a big deal.
Australia awards to Hochtief, who signed a $154 million contract with the government yesterday, repeatedly significant orders.
The sub-company ACS will use its domestic subsidiary Leighton to improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This improvement will provide fast internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-story King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane, which has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investments amount to EUR 75 million.
FCC Receives Contract for a Tunnel in Slovenia for 64 Million
FCC has procured a total of 64.5 million euros for the construction of a 2.1-kilometre long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia through its subsidiary Alpine.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the contract for the construction work to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore Receives Advertisement from Renfe
Renfe has allocated the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sr. Rushmore in the amount of about three million euros per year, the railway company said.
Mrs Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that presented for this competition, four of which entered the final round, including TBWA, who was responsible for advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom was fined more than $63 million for failing to compete.
France’s Competition Regulator has fined France Télécom more than €63 million for anti-competitive conduct in the country’s Caribbean territories.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on landline and mobile by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased as the competition watchdog believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company followed the example of other telephone providers and opened an application trading site on the Internet in order to increase revenues from businesses that did not derive from the telephone connection.
Basically, this Orange recruitment website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
We have to wait until 2010 for these seven to be available to other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League game has earned Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a 476.4 million since the start.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has become a source of revenue for football clubs.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, earning them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League brings not only fame, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) who have participated in this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is third in Europe, which earned the most money from its participation and which, besides AC Milan, is the only one who has won the trophy three times.
The incumbent Catalan champion and last winner of the former 1992 European Cup takes fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also earned the most money through their participation in the past Champoins League.
They lost to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to win money through the champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, in contrast to four Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by UEFA’s complicated funding procedure.
This fiscal year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million through the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides for 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a participation received 3.8 million from their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they played.
There is also a bonus for winning (€800,000) and for a draw (€400,000 per team). The clubs that made it to the eighth final each receive three million; the four that made it to the quarterfinals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns $9 million, as opposed to the second, who receives $5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed revenues.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a earned 2.5 million in the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is among the first and has 4 places allocated.
Last year’s Master receives 40% of allocated money, 30% of second, 20% of third and 10% for fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday leaked details on the offer to buy shares, with which it intends to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which are paid out over ten years and with an annual interest rate of 1% due to this shift.
Yesterday the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a 15-day deadline to report their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos reiterated that it had contacted the Authority.
On closing, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to avoid possible purchase offers and the court quarrels of his former managers, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position at the food business.
This is a newly created position, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is far from polemic free, because the company is involved in a judicial battle on suspicion of diverting more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will shift further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar’s loan yesterday, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly, confirming that they had approved the displacement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves Paternina’s public invitation to tender submitted by investment company Mer
The National Securities and Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the invitation to tender submitted by investment company Mer for Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this tender after it had been proven that the conditions complied with the legally binding laws and therefore the content of the submitted explaining pamphlet, according to the amendments of last December 2, could be considered "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn represents 8.95% of the share capital, which consists of 6,142,786 euros in shares registered on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it was informed that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the completion of the tender and the price of which was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the statutory provisions.
New Vehicle Assessment Programs
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car workshops earn
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops, where an expert has to assess the damage and the cost of repair.
No accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of the reviewers use this type of system.
Accident Assessment and Repair Service and Application Providers collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process it thereafter and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with in the tool market for review and reporting are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex’s sales manager, it is working with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is an arduous task, because every single one of the thousands of vehicle parts must be categorized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "smart" graphic image, on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, 99.2% of cars sold in Spain have full information.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the vehicle fleet on the roads, it is over 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out documentation work and producing databases, Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually specialists in mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every other day.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways, thus offering different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, however, depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the file or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
By reviewing the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the kind of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of the products being AudaPlus, a standard accident assessment solution for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each review.
The most expensive for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the mounting belt can be fully identified only by the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is an internet service open to the specialist market, which can be used to offer vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or in order to obtain information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, it can be used to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident over a certain period of time.
Gt Motives is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and provides in the same way digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide for Expertise is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
In the last three years, its business volume has increased by 20% annually and in 2008 sales amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they also started to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in 1966 in Germany and established in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% is in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.

In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2 % more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and are part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the group Solera Autoonline bought a flatfom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant payment of €59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-added, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, reviewers, car rental companies, workshops, scrap sites and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the site has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added every day in the Spanish market.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered may no longer be driven on the roads, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars of historical value may be re-registered, even if they have been cancelled after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The ease of handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the working hours, surcharges or discounts and then they can have the estimate printed and passed on to their customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for evaluation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
The company Audatex is currently working to offer these images in three-dimensional formats.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time, since you can choose a door with it, for example, and then completely turn the image to look at the inside.
