Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be awarded, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have plenty to do.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he meets the five members of the committee that, in October, chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple is scheduled to meet with the Norwegian king, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth U.S. president to receive him, although the third to receive him in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and cheque of ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million Czech kronor).
It is proposed to donate them to charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided to which organization in particular.
During their full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended by the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama had a rather reserved attitude towards the award from the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for everyone who fights for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents “a challenge to take action.”
Nature defender accused of blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the Spole<0xC4><0x8D>nost ochránc<0xC5><0xAF> p<0xC5><0x99>írody Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice (Society of Nature Advocates Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice) of blackmail.
Last year she appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals she demanded money from investors for their own benefit, said Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The president of the Society of Natural Defenders Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice is Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently detained and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
And in Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno the garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, in order to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle in the right container in the center?
It is almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí square, opposite Potrefená Huse.
Don’t be angry with Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
It does not need to be mentioned that elsewhere it is not easy to separate the garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
By vagrancy
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to throw away several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, by going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It’s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be of much interest to the Brno socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the extra league of hockey, which embarrass us all over the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials to make Brno cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the company EKO-KOM, Brno is truly the worst in the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
The budget of "Paroubek" took away money from income and sickness allowances
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sickness allowances or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Treasury Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they relied on the government to later ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, incomes or sickness allowances. "That just means postponing problems for the future, it's putting mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, someday, you have to return the money.
The state does not have many options to make money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or operating expenses of the state, it has to increase taxes.
To all the ones added by the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, his children as well.
People don't have to worry about income or sickness allowances, they'll get them. From these accounts, 1.8 billion disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year will not be missing in the treasury only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will continue to rise along with interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, five billion will also be missing next year to finish the construction of highways and railroads.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and whose prices cannot be reduced.
The best thing you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large buildings; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed a Solomon solution for the decrease of funds: it will get money from the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which is mostly owned by the state, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless sack.
Last year <0xC4><0x8C>EZ allocated $18 billion to the budget.
Each year of the dividends are settled ecological damages, serve to complete the account for rents or serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of the rents.
In addition, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers does not end here.
Almost $3 billion was obtained from the budget to award various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Afterwards, the Minister will have to save money inside the spring or, in the worst case scenario, make use of the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the two billion-dollar Státní pokladna (State Box) project, which has already been initiated. It must allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone can work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With the press of a key, they move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They will be able to switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a RAM of 128 MB, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
The company VMware cooperates with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
It’s not just the ski lifts in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e who care about snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow makes people not book skiing stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at deals, check prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether there will be snow or mud this Christmas," said Spindl.Info portal maintainer Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Mlýn according to their expectations should not hesitate to book their stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put quality accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
<0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Mlýn hoteliers offer weekly New Year's Eve stays.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered are still free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some last-minute holiday stays,” said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí’s travel agency can still offer New Year’s Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer seats.
They sell very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is impaired by the lack of snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountain without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will run out as well,” Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou; last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are already occupied at the Omnia Hotel, near the central car park in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we stand at approximately sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hoteliers of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will be hungry for snow waiting.
On Thursday the temperatures should drop and, if there is rainfall, in the mountains it should snow.
But then the temperatures will rise again, reported Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubský of Hradec Králové of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It’s funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats on the Afghan issue the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the foolishest.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it proved to be a copy of the script Bush used for Iraq, created three years ago.
Not only is the phrase "the same as in Iraq" repeatedly used in the same text, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for his own statement: "A new way forward."
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country suffering from the civil war, and criticized it as “an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences.”
The following months, however, proved that Bush’s strategy, based on recommendations from field captains, was the only one possible and successful, so that today nothing is said about Iraq in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, however objectively he left his successor in a much more favorable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided rifles in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn’t think of anything better, so at least he deceived the general about 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finishing this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is being fulfilled.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only one people of Potemkin, and patriarchal tribal relations will remain behind him.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confused relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is “capable of action,” a minimum target of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy collides with his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon" will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans have less and less willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem by military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years to go before the presidential election, so there is still a lot of time to come up with another strategy, if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers Will Not Receive Cash Bonuses Again
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold in a minimum period of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn in the event that they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it must take, said former JPMorgan investor banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after cutting nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the move announced today, $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a fifty percent tax, bank bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record number, received this year’s Nobel Prizes in specialized categories and literature in Stockholm today from King Charles XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists, she was among the winners also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as her compatriot Jack Szostak for chromosome research.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The latest award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each winner collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish kronor (approximately 25 million Czech kronor).
If there are several winners in each category, the prize will be shared with each other.
The traditionally most awaited Nobel Peace Prize laureate, received him this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive finance minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in government as he disagrees with the version of the state budget for next year, approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
The budget, and perhaps also Janota’s stay in the cabinet, is supposed to be the subject of her Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
President Radim Ochvat’s spokesman said the meeting.
On his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The House of Representatives, however, on Wednesday approved proposals from the left for transfers of funds and increased money for salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious internal policy conflict. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer’s bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the SDG, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Representatives, de facto liquidates the package of savings measures, imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; he said today during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long ignored "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
The vice president of ODS, Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words “strong sentencing.”
The head of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek.
On Wednesday <0xC4><0x8C>SSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the protagonist roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sport, racial relations, and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's drama about the world of boxing Milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the slavery abolition movement, the fictional U.S. president, and even God's in Evan Almighty. But rarely does he represent someone who is still alive, and so much for him.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong in the world to the outsiders.
The South African team made it to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the theaters.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
Most importantly, I wanted to shake Mandela’s hand.
I found that by squeezing your hand, I get your energy, it is transmitted, and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, she said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough rugby world.
A big surprise for him was when he finally met Pienaar at home for the first time.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, “In the movie I look much higher.”
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talks about ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety magazine film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The Secret of Splendor About Norway Solved: Russians Tested a Missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
Russia’s Defense Ministry acknowledged that near the border with Norway it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The "Bulava"-type missile, previously destined to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even his repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly out or a fault occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That’s why it’s likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed “Bulavá”.
The Norwegians did not hesitate from the outset that it was a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time by stating that one cannot speak simply of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely flawless, according to the Ministry of Defense management only six of the thirteen failed.
The success of almost fifty percent fills the generals with optimism and therefore they continue to claim that "Bulava" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was wounded, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the Moscow club’s coach.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest-lived professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary striker Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one for the entire season, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second half of his career he had successes also in the NHL: playing with Detroit won twice the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hall of Glory of Hockey.
Hyundai complied with the trade union requirements. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the automobile factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the extra work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, the unions declared the emergency for strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions a further Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will be worked in two shifts, said Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
According to the server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working on Saturday's shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can collect the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, that is, extending the Christmas holidays by one day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shifts will receive money for the trip and for the meal.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon immediately to cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Car factory employees were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted virtually every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists is scheduled to take place on Monday morning.
The head of the trade unions Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they pledged to meet the requirements and signed the document, they were willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the auto factory worsened last week, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent supplementary work.
They also protested against poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
Management said employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the strike emergency on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, who stopped manufacturing last Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, the unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The series production was started last November.
As of last September, it has manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech Discovery: An Effective Substance Even in ‘Challenged’ HIV Viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some already accessible drugs.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, patients’ lives can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarboranes have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way unlike all medicines used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘enhanced’ compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus’s albumin.
Metallocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are bonded by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitorous and resilient virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, HIV virus fractionation does not occur and mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would not be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, explain the scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was carried out on a specimen, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in the clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on the resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, makes metallocarborans interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of organic and biochemical chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Chemistry.
Fight for budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said the approved budget for next year is "frightening" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The SDG statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say time is left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the bureaucratic cabinet concept with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether he wants to rely on the minority in the House of Representatives, whether he wants to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendment proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the SDG proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion kronor.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the government’s wish, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of the disappointment and sense of uselessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign if the amendment proposals were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>eská televize Janota asked for a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He said he is thinking about staying in the role.
The reason is his disappointment in the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees to another fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as in the government the nominees have nothing to do by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, if he will resign, if the House passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to sickness subsidies, incomes, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated for SDGs are not to blame
It is the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated for the SDG have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the U.S. text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign from the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, to lean on the left majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I haven’t thought about it, when the time comes, I’ll take care of it,” Defense Minister Martin Bartak, who was appointed to the government by the members of the SDGs, told reporters in the House of Deputies.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a European Council meeting in Brussels in the afternoon.
SDGs yielded at Prime Minister's request
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that SDGs in the House of Deputies on Wednesday would likely vote against the amended budget if the prime minister does not explicitly ask SDG deputies to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he reacted to the question, if SDG does not care about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn’t realize my vote was missing.
On resigning from the mandate he knew that in the following months it would be mainly about the Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek reacted himself.
<0xC4><0x8C>D’s new train schedule says fewer trains will run at almost the same rates
<0xC4><0x8C>eské drahy (Czech Railways) from December 13 will cancel or restrict some fast and less used local trains and, on the contrary, reinforce some links.
The total extension of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule goes into effect.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, drahy for this line will add a pendolino road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not run again to Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice fewer fast trains will run, direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the biggest reduction in transport planned by drahy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice track and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to only a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
From December 13th, travelers will not travel again to Bratislava in Pendolino.
This year’s regional rail account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, as this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them nearly three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains drahy have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why they did not raise the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will occur only on day tickets - <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and on cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travelers without a customer card, the <0xC4><0x8C>D Net price will increase from 450 kronor to 600 kronor.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance, until now there was the one-time price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine Armed Forces Continue to Detain More Than 50 People, Children Have Been Released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in southern Philippines today, including several elementary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which previously reported only about 65 abductees.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 gunmen are said to use the hostages as a living shield when fleeing from police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the gunmen belong to the New People’s Navy (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, police previously pursued the kidnappers due to violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of local families.
In southern Philippines in Maguindanao province it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor’s elections, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>ený), will premiere in the US theaters, which captures a part of the biography of former President Nelson Mandela of the South African Republic.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the lead role.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, together with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa culminate preparations for the world championship in soccer. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the protagonist roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman says, however, that he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can remember Mandela’s character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the costume of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts on the costume of the South African national rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA then won the World Cup.
By entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The soccer championship will perhaps succeed in helping people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany, said in an interview recently for LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns burns
The fire grabbed in the morning a transformer from the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps in a switch box near the village of Vý<0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsko.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the <0xC3><0x9A>stí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company’s spokeswoman, the breakdown does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, enumerating it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer by a new one.
During the ten years of <0xC4><0x8C>eps' activity nothing similar happened, such failures are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, spokeswoman of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ company for northern Czechia, the power supplies were not cut off, and the fire of the power substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps p<0xC5><0xAF>sobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the electrical conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which bring the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, also maintains the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a slander complaint against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Hetmans
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today will file a slander complaint against three social-democratic Hetmans.
These are Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the region Jihomoravský kraj, Radko Martínek from Pardubický kraj and hetman from Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura mentioned it in Twenty minutes on Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with <0xC4><0x8C>eské drahy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the raisins from the cake", however we only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than <0xC4><0x8C>eské drahy, which is not true. We know the prices of <0xC4><0x8C>eské drahy, which were fixed last week.
So we have nothing but to defend ourselves.
It is for slander towards the Society Student Agency, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
At the same time he mentioned having the evidence of all the regions. According to him they have not taken necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose, which will be clearly demonstrated this time too, that Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura manipulates the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that he would invest several million crowns in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be carried out against the corruption as such.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started the campaign after the regions agreed with <0xC4><0x8C>eské drahy to maintain regional rail links and for the commission of approximately 150 billion kronor did not call a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura claims to have been threatened by a <0xC4><0x8C>SSD deputy because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't leave it, we can lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a deputy of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know, which gentleman he is, I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura said today to Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will end the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting maximum vaccine prices, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have already made it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free Vaccines for Children Born in August
From January onwards, children born since August 2 last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is not to have received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the third and fifth month of age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily allowed their children to be vaccinated against pneumococcal infections.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450,000 crowns on vaccines annually.
Nonetheless, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 on all vaccinations of children annually.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Pneumococcal infections in our country die every year according to research in hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic the pneumococcal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, at the same time there are opinions, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The compulsory vaccine would be better, said Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Their association has spread pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we have to go now, Kalovský said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At the moment we don’t think about it at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the paediatrician society Odborná spole<0xC4><0x8D>nost praktických d<0xC4><0x9B>tských léka<0xC5><0x99><0xC5><0xAF> Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
"In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," Cabrnochová says.
Experts expect that as of next year, more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies be vaccinated against pneumococcal infections.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, then save on treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gave them other vaccines.
Some deputies, however, feared that insurance companies could “take money out of health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in 40,000 vaccines a month, which is a notable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while loading 90 frames into his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
The AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta Jr., 52, told police that her father had ordered her "to enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta father denied granting such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increases in Budget
Ministers have advocated tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements from 2011 onwards.
Cholera for Social Security
The unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished by a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems.”
The rise in Social Security spending, which will grow by around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which says this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE REPORT BEFORE THE BUDGET
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, from April 2011
The economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonds
The 1-point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax relief for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 per year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and outlined spending cuts were a “grain of sand in the desert” compared to what was needed.
“These are big numbers, and it will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party’s forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and how quickly the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Finance Minister was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75 percent this year, much worse than the 3.5 percent decline forecast in April, while the loan request would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion above the previously estimated.
"A wasted opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party’s “debt crisis,” said the projected <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion loan application for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, “cynically” dodging the difficult choices until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They haven't included anything meaningful about what they're going to do," the Minister said in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond.
“All important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek further short-term deficit reduction.
But Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised from tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sandcastles.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing chosen for the announcements, such as the rising inflation of some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the Treasury Minister exposed to allegations of election maneuvering, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour party insists that people are being provided with it most needed and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although the ministers did not publish post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Treasury Minister’s figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“This is really postponing the pain for later,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“All the important announcements will come after the election, win whoever wins,” added Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s accountant economic consultant.
"This has been the fake pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
FBI inquires into ‘American arrests in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are reportedly of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are U.S. citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges on which they have been detained and in what kind of circumstances they are being detained," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to one of their uncle's.
He said the house was already in the sights of local police and that no charges had been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the U.S. had to “work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian ‘abuses’
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report details “the patterns of abuse” of the regime, before and after the June presidential elections.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes; another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected precedent criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticism has a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, as saying he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election result.
“They often hit me in the face,” according to her words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and they humiliated me."
Amnesty said after five days he signed a false confession and released it and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied allegations of rape, but admitted there had been abuse.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks, at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the discomfort of post-election and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee’s inquiries had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
She made a ski slope in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a racing track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping ramp, facing a 100-meter-long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
It is seen below a beautiful view of the lights of the city flickering.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent.”
The prizes were awarded for the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the continent’s most openly secular societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailedly argued study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France’s 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them of renown, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are unable to fully disseminate this argument.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite so fiercely defending secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives “a adjustment of values.”
After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most desolate panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Interests in oil, gas, transportation and fishing have focused on newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors as a result.
In "On Thin Ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and politics of whaling, it describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave proof of courage by confronting the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a brave 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The offspring, captured while swimming following the bodies of their recently exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth of the area of a wild adult’s scope. The climate is almost never adequate: a Singapore-based polar bear turned green by the algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis resorts to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the slaughter continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Eskimo Indians on snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to bring down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a staggering look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It's not a lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering travels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave indications for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines plotted a map of the moving cords of ice circulating beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of probes mounted on icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system inside the Arctic ice, formed by splashes of saline water that is compressed as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they’re all doomed once the summer ice pulls out, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among 6,000 placing crowns in Arlington tombs
Pfc. De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
In a few months, from where we are being embarked, these could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it is us, I would want someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place crowns on veterans’ graves at various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the graves of Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career deceased military man.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It’s like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older tombs of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don’t get as many visitors as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands as they carried the fresh pine to the gravestones.
Each circular crown was a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud names sculpted on the stones, while others leaned to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Navy gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
“Long after my death I want someone to remember it.”
Cuban officials arrested U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobiles and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything that is considered "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a fledgling blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has applied on several occasions for permission to leave the country to accept awards, but has been denied permission.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor could likely spark tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a “slow-paced” approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for texting, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign hotel visitors, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide further information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly incorrect.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing mobiles for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of Human Rights Watch, which recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba itself", a reference to the location of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said defendants are often detained, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He said any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who scout the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason, they were rejected, the official said, who spoke anonymously because of the delicateness of the case.
The official said the men were not disturbed and were even trying to get proper approval to access al-Qaeda camps when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the recruiters’ critical role in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who they are trusted.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people inside al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting by those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said al-Qaeda analyzes with special attention the aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge appeal, due to their potential for access to American targets and due to their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?” said Kohlmann.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand ‘climate action’
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched down the streets demanding more daring climate action from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, though a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that said “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish that declared, “The Earth says “enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel to Peru, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues that the country must deal with because of the impacts of climate change that are already happening.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to evade it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mostly for wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate talks, activists in sports masks and black attire placed several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started out as flares, but were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
Asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “I wasn’t really aware of the situation.”
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each defining whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, “it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Test data reveals persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal gradebook on mathematics performance was very good news for the public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best-performing systems, the gradebook showed fourth and eighth grade students jumped at a faster pace over the past two years, compared to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Evaluation of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of fourth-grade white D.C. students over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in performance actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth-degree African-Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between fourth-grade black and white students in 2003, when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely narrowed to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. The Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by serving those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit organization advocating educational equity in the District.
I’m not making jumps of joy over a two- or three-point difference, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Deputy Deputy), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an on-going critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message from the test scores is that the city’s high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what worries us is that we are not spending the time or energy necessary for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at high- and middle-school students who did not master the foundations of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Math, a math curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, emphasizing games and real-life experiences, was introduced to the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall system performance while still providing additional money and resources for underperforming schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here’s a kind of crude dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate political repercussions that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can have access to excellent public education.
Janey, now a superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the difference in performance is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year in a 185-day year, which he sees as an "indicator" to look for a bigger increase in the next agreement.
Make higher education a part of the future
The tour bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolve.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, descended and flashed for a moment in front of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders of the group explored Gettysburg, where enrollment costs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes, this is where I will be!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Fuck, really? he said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the school’s low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in their teens, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze the highest performers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not fix it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the tour of Graciela’s universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to run college preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue to finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions ending Saturday.
The 10 agreements the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away after bidding on only two of the 10 auction sites.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached deals for stocks auctioned in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in opening up Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military pulls out, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from taking more vigorous risks in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not account to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have forged ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese state-owned National Petroleum Corporation offered on more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major deposits.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological powerhouse, oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on the same footing as its competitors and will deliver on its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit proposals made bids that were then confronted with the barrel grant that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each site.
Al Qaeda's main planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile strike on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a major al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles struck his car near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified, CIA-operated aircraft inside Pakistan’s illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, a Pakistani civil intelligence agency official said, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally shattered bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a senior al-Qaeda military planner, who led the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He devoted himself to conspiracy around the world, said a senior official, who spoke anonymously, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guidance from al-Qaeda’s senior command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had quickly ascended into the ranks of al-Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a name known to some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led unmanned aircraft attacks has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a recount from The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit organization.
The decline is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
U.N. top envoy in Kabul about to resign
The top UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down from his post in March, ending with a tumultuous term that was harmed by accusations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's UN-backed presidential election.
Eide’s departure comes when the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. schedule for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who would collaborate with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that he would have time to find a replacement.
What I’ve said is that it’s better for them to start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun seeking a replacement, according to U.N. officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested by his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminating charges, but said the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, "surely harmed the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism regarding international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a high civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, lending themselves to the Afghan mission, saying this would increase his confidence that his money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed his frustration over the limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermine his ability to recruit talent.
So the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran faces additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for its failure to engage in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me down is that, if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that “a package of incentives and disincentives” would be needed “to persuade the Iranian government that they would be actually less safe with nuclear weapons,” because “their people will suffer greatly” the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the directions of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he said he would re-negotiate on the restriction of his nuclear program and would agree to leave a substantial part of his reserve of enriched uranium, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such a deal, as a way to build trust between the two sides and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from tentative agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of compromising with the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran’s hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way that they haven’t been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline December 31 for Iran to respond to proposals, before reconsidering other options, including continuing with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday "unfounded and baseless accusations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to get an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to diminish the potential for conflict, to avoid any delays in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates’ words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that preached to them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only to one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, miserable single children, affectionately dubbed “little emperors,” a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six when the policy came into effect, according to the Division.
The UN’s demographic, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly cultured populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of Shanghai’s Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate a future shortage of labor.”
Shanghai is about to be “as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden,” he said.
Gradual relief
Drafted in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced by the Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in enforcing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have made abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they attenuated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Demographic Research Institute, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night in the morning, posters ordering families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very unoverwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child following the campaign’s launch, the more urban districts do not indicate any changes.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Caolu municipality in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give the best of their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yes, they're robbing us of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants a single child because she was too: “We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to caring for others and really don’t want to care for others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two careers, middle-class, which reduce the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and they don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are issues of space, "they have to remodel their apartment", and the strategic "have to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycare centers when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Drafts Plan to Reduce Emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, so far characterized by defiant stance and mutual recrimination, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that predicts ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a time-consuming negotiation, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by a UN ad hoc working group, the text doesn’t talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as “the big picture.”
It shows the profiles for a possible deal, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce theirs by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday was presented the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the conversations last week.
US special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies if they were not financed by the developed world.
The move indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, compared to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense,” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global overheating.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the world’s twenty-four most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing about who should afford the expenses to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive by seeking to contain the large emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change for Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change said they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say the talks will at best produce a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push of small island nations has “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks assumed a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before heads of government reach a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and rushed into the hallways of the Bella Center, to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, in order to delineate the claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute mess of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists who play the guitar present night shows mocking the countries that they say are selling, and preliminary proposals are passed hand-to-hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for global conservation policy.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train at 225 km / h from Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13 a.m. Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to London’s St Panrcas station, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then join Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbs of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the shift from planes and cars to railroads would reduce national coal emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, all three major political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental damage, can still curb Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on Dec. 30, the Times reported.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Penns to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"This seems to be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railroad.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stretch, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support trains of 400 mt in length, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed that could accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the capital's space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to fit the high-speed network.
Experts from the rail industry argue that only the St Pancras International or Euston station offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave fast lanes on existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is regarded as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change from planes to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Face Mortgage for <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Oranger from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he built in his constituency house.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living on “rations,” raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak framed extension in his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the extra interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the requests in time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan said the requests "could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
The nearby houses have been sold for nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an “orange tree”.
Neighbors described it as “a greenhouse for entertainment.”
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges on his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a 271,406-pound mortgage from his London property to the home of his constituency, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was soliciting approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, its applications rose to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, the rate at which it is now.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as House Opposition Speaker in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive "rations" after the spending scandal.
“Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like shit.”
He stated: “I spend my money in my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what’s appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t.”
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the wage office that this “could be considered excessive.”
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the sterling symbol in Mr. Duncan’s lawn in protest, after revealing that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, approved both by the wage office and later by Legg."
He added: “It’s not about evading and breaking or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn’t be clearer or simpler in any way.”
Come, believers, to see the advent calendar of the Brighton Beach palapa
The Brighton palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 5.30 to 6.30 every day, with filled cakes and punch served free of charge.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid cleric from the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said, “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the palapa’s advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to try and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested on Saturday in demand for an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched through the frozen Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change is expected to reach by Friday, which would come into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish Climate Conference President, the growing global climate mobilization, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, smashed windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP reporter reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, are especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the rally, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinctions", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and sat despite the intense cold."
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, home of the negotiations.
Protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the guest speakers, and the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a vigil with candles.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with sky rain jackets, responded by forming a first morning concentration in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form “blue tides” for “justice and for the climate.”
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine militant at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: there’s time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, waterways that you can walk through like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters were formed calling for strong action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Abkhazia separatist elected president, although Georgia denounces 'fraud'
On Saturday, Abkhazia, the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces “fraud.”
Some 131,000 people were summoned to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Election tables closed at 5pm GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first preliminary results would be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates in the race, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of the votes.
These elections are a farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the full Russian occupation," spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended in several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to prove through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large planks show Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different locations of this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, to the west of the country, district chief Beslan Archba warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to monitor the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: “We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and most particularly, the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
"I hope your country is quickly recognized by the United Nations," said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that is due to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without attempting to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the guest speakers, and the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a vigil with candles.
A few moments after the demonstration began, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP reporter reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and steadfastly intervened, throwing several of them to the ground.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were burned near a busy house during incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, police said.
We did not take our eyes off the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with sky rain jackets, responded by forming a first morning concentration in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form “blue tides” for “justice and for the climate.”
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine militant at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization, along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed calling for action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography comes reinforced from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview that will be broadcast in the Sunday Newspaper (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would come "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all students in the first year of high school will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The branches General Education and Literary cannot be sub-branches of the C, he goes on to stress even: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged that they had eliminated history and geography in second grade of high school technology."
An IFOP poll published Saturday in L’Humanité revealed that approximately seven out of ten Frenchmen (69%) disapproved of the government’s project to eliminate compulsory history-geography education in high school second C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that “no talk is being made” of removing philosophy from the C-secondary high school program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they said sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also practice in real conditions during the M2 year, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as internship teachers.
If you do all the practices proposed before the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
In the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School, accepted on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the Ernest conference, a day consisting of a series of 15-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that attracted people and convey to them the desire to know more, explained in the framework of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We chose some twenty participants from the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, “we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that “the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific record.”
The videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school’s website starting December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Delay in payments: disgust among prison guards, planned to take action
Prison guard unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers’ Force (second guard union) called on off-duty personnel to join the demonstration Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “block them” to report the theft of their possessions.
The CGT penitentiary (third union of the profession) calls them to "meet in general assemblies in different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", because it calls "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization ... in order to increase discontent and fury."
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all of them were accounted for, but they say that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Foreign Ministry reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who "always blame budgetary demands," deplored the Ufap / Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said outraged the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and calls".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when tasks and missions are increased without taking more force, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, the CGT detention centre of Bordeaux estimates.
According to trade unions, not all regions are the same, as some are luckier than others.
But in any case, the result is not as expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Makes “Better Gifts” Than He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will be celebrating his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television host Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion regarding gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will air on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holidays at their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s small four-legged companion, will be on the go.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will “of course” receive a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, last year I made you nice gifts," she said, teasing the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering humorously pointing to the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you that?”
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a bicycle with two speeds, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
The First Lady recalled her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture in line against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the home, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims to be in an induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was intervened again in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened Wednesday night through Thursday at Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sinai hospital where doctors tested “injuries derived from the herniated disc surgery” performed in Paris on November 26, his press service in the same city said, indicating that such injuries “needed a repair operation.”
However, the singer’s press service tried to convey tranquility by stating that the situation was “under control,” and reported that a new medical part would be communicating within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more certain about his or her condition, RTL adds.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that “according to some sources” no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic in Monceau Park due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai hospital on Monday for an infection derived from Delajoux's intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but said he was "no problem" because the rocker is "a wrestler."
“He called me just before I traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to fly twelve hours after such an operation, it’s not possible,” said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, claimed that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled."
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer’s health problems have multiplied since July when he was interned for nine days following a crash on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed he had been operated on a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
Fans and journalists noticed the musician’s difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: first Bousquet title in his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medallist at the 2009 World Long Pool Championships, won an international title on Thursday at a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, when polyurethane swimsuits were last allowed, only three world records were beaten when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A shame for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, mark he owns in long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, on 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman prevailed with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that will be banned from January 1.
These swimsuits, originating from 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same race.
This time the use of swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in 400m free (3:32.77), however, he prevailed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give up in this race.
I knew I wasn’t going to be able to break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: Zola owned sarcophagus panel sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged to French writer Emile Zola sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel, 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century AD, and its price had been estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
"The marble depicting four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunk women, is an unusual piece, since there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions for ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bid by buyers, undoubtedly, a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her private Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborts Zelaya’s departure for Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that conditions were not given to transfer to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied the safe conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
To grant him a safe-conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as the inviting head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my position (...), they wanted me to submit my resignation," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been in the country for five months.
Here I can stay for ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, refugee in the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a safe-conduct application, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum application, the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya’s departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president on Wednesday, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coup government.
That reflects the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, a day when he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to face justice for the crime of "high treason," according to the coup government.
De facto President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial poll, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya’s return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures faithfully witnessing the economic recovery of both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67 percent; and the Nasdaq 0.33 percent.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We get good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused primarily on US trade balance figures, “which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular, exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “was the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% on the eve.
Cuba: More than 100 power supporters bully “Ladies in White”
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty “Ladies in White”, wives or relatives of political prisoners, were beaten in the street by supporters of the government of Raúl Castro as they walked to the center of the capital demanding the release of those detainees, a journalist from AFP said.
The Yankees die!, “Mercenaries!”, “The street belongs to the revolutionaries!”, “Long live Fidel and Raul!”, the militants of power chanted to the dissidents with their fists.
The latter were escorted by agents dressed as civilians who came to "protect" them.
The day before, a similar demonstration unleashed against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for International Human Rights Day, were arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, an AFP journalist reported.
Agents forcibly jumped into the vehicles on dissidents who were booed by government supporters, according to the reporter.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in such circumstances only lasts for a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, serves a sentence of 20 years in prison.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities brand opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” at the wages of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely done in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration by government militants against the “counterrevolutionaries”.
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an 80-year-old with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Alts of the Seine) on Thursday at the time of the biggest influx in the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly beat with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elderly man, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 of Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a head of the Alliance police union.
Then at the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, stood in and was wounded.
The first two victims, severely wounded, were transferred to the hospital where the elderly man died.
The life of the other injured, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was interned "in a state of shock," a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped down Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
Apparently at random, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: a man of thirty years, and another of forty seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher’s knives that were crossed on his back, said Arnaud Pressé, an Alliance union official in the Seine Highs.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alienated, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They couldn’t do it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a bartender at a nearby bar.
A crowd threw themselves over him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were punched, according to police testimony.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was a man injured on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I perceived a very important wound in the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, arrived with knife wounds.
National police detained the man without identity documents.
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Seine (SDPJ 92).
The insane man was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his interim detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of placing him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all such upset whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action".
US: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the case to be dismissed
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again complained Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, is dismissed, over a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the director's lawyer for "The Pianist," reported serious procedural errors at the time of the events to three judges of the Second District of California Appeals Chamber in 1977.
Hummel stated: “I complain that the charges are dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, “was chilling.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who has since died) had talked to a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before he issued a sentence, which constitutes a serious breach of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September that he had lied to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, namely that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence for “illegal sexual relations” with a girl under the age of 13.
Since then, he has never stepped on the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be here to appear at the hearing.”
"With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of fleeing," Asayama asked.
The filmmaker “asks for a favor from the court, although he despises its authority.”
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel wasn’t the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She argues that her client no longer stands to be harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his cabin in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed aimlessly on Friday, in a market that is struggling between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points reaching 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains at narrow margins, the volume of trade is increasingly reduced and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve market opinion on the robustness of the economic recovery," summarized analysts at Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence recovered visibly in December, 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary index estimate.
However, indices were slowed by a new dollar upturn that reached the highest level of the past two months against the euro, "bringing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," Deutsche Bank's Owen Fitzpatrick said.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492% on the eve.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 Miss World title candidates are on the final line to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were voted Miss Athlete or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real upheaval.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
“I saw so many things and I experienced countless experiences,” said Miss Sierra Leone astonished.
This event, which will be held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, North of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m.
I can't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and by the possibility of rediscovering "breathtaking African landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the Miss World candidates concentrate on the contest.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, the music and the dance will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, in a swimsuit.
Chinese host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa has proven to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that is hard to match, said Miss World President Julia Morley.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will certainly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I would meet.
Probably coming back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday 'are very positive', according to son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 h GMT).
The singer's son said he would move to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection from the herniated disc surgery in Paris on November 26.
The musician is "induced in a coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where he was admitted Monday for an infection, following a herniated disc surgery on Nov. 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on Wednesday night to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by his daughter Jade, to witness a school event, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The Head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic of Parc Monceau, in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
We are talking about a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had “traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon.”
I talked directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice on disc hernia, he added.
Shortly before, on RTL, he indicated that the singer had apparently "left without cannula, with nothing," after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.
This is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by justice on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and scam.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from advisable."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation “could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage,” he added.
Either way, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a bracket.
Undoubtedly, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I find it very risky, Camus stated.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s MoDem (Democratic Movement), reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former giscardista party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, otherwise he could be sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the acronym UDF, since he believes that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having reached out to the left.
On the other hand, the Defense Minister, whose party is associated with the UMP, planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, he received the help of the deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the rights of ownership of the trademark to them, under penalty of judicial demand.
In recent days, you have made many statements implying that you would propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Central Alliance.
They also believe it right to continue the use of the movement’s name, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +UDF d’aujourd’hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the signatories of the letter argue.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that demands that the NC remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any support, as well as from (its) Internet site."
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of the trademark to the legitimate holders."
Failure to do so will result in an appeal to the courts to uphold the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they specify that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "elected" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Accordingly, the New Center has no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF in 2007 voted to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It uses the absence of registration of the acronym UDF scandalously and fraudulently to carry out it on its own.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they denounce, before mocking the strategy of the NC: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make its own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the court in Nanterre decided to bring artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to trial to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the eighty-year-old’s state of weakness to plunder her part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of the stars of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This means that in this case there will be a saga-worthy process about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday must submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating whether and during which periods Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness.
I think he will.
I’m going to talk to her,” said Mrs. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiesman, as he left the hearing.
For his part, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
“The investigation will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect,” he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed criminal lawsuits against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of years of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or artwork.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the provenance of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ allegations were, on some occasions, a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she was suspicious of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to talk to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise again.”
For its part, the Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre once again considered that the plaintiff was unable to appear, all the more so as a guardianship judge has refused, in recent days, to give rise to her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before the courts, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place," prosecutor Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney said.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers once the trial had taken place.
Management revolution or the end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees reminds of the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to "values" determined from above as it used to impose on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to the strategies of conquering the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
Demobilization of employees can end in deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more so, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) “requires that all parties involved ... have a proactive behavior and a forward-looking vision”; it needs a commitment on the part of employees that completely opposes the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the concerns of the company as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the Orange questionnaire among its employees, incite managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many laps, all the companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the ancient behaviorist theory that the American “neurosciences” recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the “commands” (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos investigation published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management stance, unsuited to today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies implies adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating into every business management reasoning or practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is possible only if it clearly appears as a means to make a part of their dreams, ambitions and projects a reality.
Nowadays, only studies from Motif Functional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring mobilization factors, business managers can monitor, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and relocate human resource management “in place”.
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for ‘just war’ Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, the U.S. right-wing, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of “just war” against U.S. enemies, hailed the speech that Obama had delivered on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the award to Obama on Oct. 9, this time applauded the presidential address, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, a leading figure in the right wing of the Republican party to USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, devoted himself Thursday in Oslo to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama adversary, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really great, the former Speaker of the House was pleased, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, whom some view as a potential Republican inauguration candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear from "a left-wing president" when he reminded Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current Washington Post chronicler, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as “he always does,” he “talked as an American president” by reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they didn’t create and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the unconvinced few on the right, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, called the speech “monotonous, pretentious and uninspired” on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech “overproduction” especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama “made the speech that was necessary,” the New York Times said, judging it “both gloomy and uplifting.”
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that ends the slogan of strike and the threat that rests on Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "joyed" by the deal, following several negotiating sessions that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday in hopes of quickly signing the text according to late in the morning.
Even when three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by knocking the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for all to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict “had been very damaging to businesses” and “they were afraid it would disrupt the holidays at the end of the year,” Bussereau said.
The text envisages an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9 per cent for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give orders to our militants that there will be no more cuts or blockages in the sourcing centers.
But there can always be some disconforming rebels, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages given international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common-sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as “a historic agreement.”
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is “an acceptable compromise.”
The agreement also envisages an increase in travel costs of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow to address above all the issue of an extraordinary payment and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a 100 million euro drop in employers' burdens" was the subject of an amendment by the government in the 2009 rectification finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote “on the same terms.”
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to the companies that are members of this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done “as soon as possible,” Bussereau said.
The opposition of employers’ organisations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "business of naives", since the 100 million euros "had already been pledged to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but to not counter those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, lamented Unostra.
The agreement puts the stability of many SMEs in the sector at risk over the next 12 months.
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, unions disagree with the proposals of the RATP
Conflicts on RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday’s meeting, the second day of strike between trade unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium request.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, only trains will run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, at the rate of one train of every two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train of every four on the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers each day, were pleased that "RATP is striving to provide service to the big stores."
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP stretch runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, roughly one in two trains ran at rush hour, and almost no trains in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no turmoil on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had stood "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on schedule."
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had planned the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RERs A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting held with the management on Friday afternoon will be analyzed.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
This is not what drivers who claim a premium owed to them want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts in parentheses its premium proposals, the CGT commented indignant, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
Which also led the unions to say that the company “didn’t care about weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could extend to RER B on Tuesday, after UNSA and the Independents filed a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line that has one million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros premiums, for schedules with alternating shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Justice Dissolves Prokurd Party, A Decision With Serious Consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked anger in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government’s task, which has just extended a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The party of the Democratic Society (DTP) was disbanded because it had become "the focus of activities that damaged the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the Court, Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and lawmaker Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party’s assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 benches in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that deputies would leave parliament before becoming parliamentarians without a partisan label.
The ruling follows a procedure launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya in 2007, accusing the DTP of obeying the “principles” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe the DTP is the legal political showcase of PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government reaches out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to heightened tensions in the Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police over the past few weeks.
Since the proclamation of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP’s premises in Diyarbakir, the large town of the Southeast mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov bombs or sling stones.
In Istanbul, about one hundred people were also concentrated.
Following the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deep down the discouragement.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
Nothing is resolved in this way, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
The snow can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger desires.
It’s not at all something that you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the FES Winter Road Maintenance Director
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
On the weekend, meteorologists may announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the FES acts in accordance with a thorough plan.
As soon as it snows heavily in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A-strips come out with large salted vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the accesses for the firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three in the morning
They should cover approximately 1,040 kilometers, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That’s why the FES starts around three o’clock in the morning, “with this the tracks are free until rush hour traffic begins”.
The hard part is when it starts to snow around 7:30 am.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which also belongs the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the inconveniences are generated, Brauburger tastes good.
Around five o’clock in the morning the FES infantry sets off, mainly the hazardous points and cruisers are cleared.
Usually the FES could not take over the entirety of the bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 10 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. does not lose sight of mainly the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the salted vehicle starts as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The Cradle of the Dinosaur
The Tawa found looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high running on the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of millions of years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa find was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea at the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we’ve found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, this is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation the remains of five specimens were collected in total.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "Triasic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the older fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts discuss, for example, when the sauriers were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadrupedal sauropods known as the "long neck", and their relatives, and the Ornithisch aherbis.
According to the analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is a primitive theropod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa’s skull, researchers found indications of air bags, such as those owned by descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to airbags, birds’ breathing is more efficient than mammals’.
In the case of Tawa, the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related lineage of later giant sauropods also possessed air pockets and light bones, it was likely that common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers deduce that saurians first emerged there.
Accordingly, the three genealogical lineages were separated at first and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say the team found along with Tawa found the remains of two other theropods not very closely related.
All three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study Science.
Of course, there are opponents as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Their opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to dominant land vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic dinosaurs expanded around the world and many new species developed, while kinship was extinct on the Triassic boundary towards the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slowed the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Participants are professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the busy casino at Frankfurt’s Goethe University had a worldwide impact.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they “refuse” the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, last week evicted the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories say, does not justify the "violent dissolution of courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command."
The eviction represented an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served for “the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest” and diverted attention from the content.
The Board of Directors has refused to engage in the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the legal claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for one’s own future, says Verdi’s national youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hesse, however, defended the performance of the university rector and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on a broadcast of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism,” said Peter Beuth, a delegate to the CDU’s provincial parliament.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are evicted.
The Left has submitted a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret armament investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Protocol of Close Collaboration" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, led the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt, the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz signed.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises from the natural sciences research centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to important Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortia Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for armament research.
Selenograde (literally translated as "Green City") was named after the forested mountain landscape, in which research facilities were established.
Brakes of Stuttgart
The Stuttgart Dimension 21 is not placed at all high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply “the new heart of Europe”.
The S21 law is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Rail terminals, which end up in the middle of the city, were then considered 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes on modern rail traffic, as it used to take a tremendous amount of time to hook the locomotives backwards.
Rotate, dry stop continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a crossing station, which is about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be launched, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
Rail terminals of course also do not have any more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE constructed stretch towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged it that way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic’s large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the designer's computer generated graphics.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At the time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably greener than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other rail projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be lacking at other crossings and narrow passages on the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long rails across the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the slow-step layout has been constructed.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international carriage of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the ruling on the airport.
The federal government is pending in the regional parliament of Wiesbaden, if it will file an appeal against the ruling on the ban on night flights of the Hesse administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the more than 400-page VGH ruling, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had reasoned in writing on this date that in the case of the planned construction of the northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport, the state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the federal government, would not be reconcilable with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until January 4, if it will file an appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to relinquish the appeal to the nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises of a ban on night air traffic, which they had made before the elections.
It’s quite difficult, if you’re allowed to keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP’s slogan “We keep our word.”
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federal government would be attempting by misrepresenting the law and tricks still to get his night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take a lot of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a “fast first impression.”
We need a legally impeccable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been his group’s claims about the night air traffic ban.
U.S. banks are paying back the loans.
Big American banks shaken by the crisis are stripping themselves of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" once returned the aid that had been provided by the Tarp bank bailout fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report from the U.S. CNBC.
With this, the institutes seek to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had garnered approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had quite a means, among others for the sale of rubles.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the investment bank’s absorption effort at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to get money on the capital market in order to be able to free itself from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported from a source of known circles that the U.S. bank could announce by Thursday the increase of its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aids in June.
Elections
In the end, everything was faster than we thought.
Just two weeks after the board of directors of the ZDF (German television channel) pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may present a successor.
Last night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main ZDF studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it probably also influenced the not to harm ZDF director Markus Schächter any more, if this proposal would also not be approved in the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The outcome of the vote was not yet finalized at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender’s contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the board of directors already weeks before the election had indicated, they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editor had been organized by the President of the Government of Hesse, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate of the prestigious editorial head with the argument, that under Brender’s direction the ZDF news outlets would have lost audience rates.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which political influence over the ZDF was scourged.
In the end, 35 public law specialists had even meddled into the debate, calling Koch’s course unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
Afterwards he worked on the station "Südwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editorial head; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit following the impeachment of Brender, who was voted journalist of the year by media magazine "Medium Magazin" on Wednesday.
Koch's opposite on the board, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of politicians supporters of the ZDF’s control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with a clever move: he heavily criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of editorial head without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote on him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a handful of supporters.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is attributed anyway to the left liberals.
College careers cleared up
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally gave up. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students in the future should be able to surpass their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module of the course should end with a single exam.
In addition, the aim is to examine the workload of students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federal states are committed to making structural rules more flexible together for Bachelor and Master degrees.
Regulations of the federal states that diverge from this should no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have continuously talked about the improvement of being able to successfully complete and complete a career (studability).
Now, for the first time, a specific content was discussed.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam," it is said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
The "significant reduction in the burden of examinations" is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, as explained by the Director of the Accreditation Board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
Furthermore, in the future "studability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined for unnecessary student restrictions in the choice of.
the courses.
Students would have “the right to obtain more space, which enables and encourages self-initiative.”
These rules would apply to new races, but also in examining existing races.
These should be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until the year 2015 to examine all races.
The responsible for this would be at the country level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is installed by the federal states.
The ministers of education and culture urged the federal states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to adopt such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Palatinate has ensured to provide additional means for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement tutoring and student counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam offices and abroad.
The state and universities are aiming to provide 10 million euros for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010 the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, a single exam should suffice for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the career should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
By the end of next year it is intended to examine all races about its "studability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the state.
Aside from the praises, there was also criticism about the decisions.
At the federal board of the Juso (Young Socialists) university groups, it was demanded that the configuration of education policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of university ministers and rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, students as the main stakeholder should now be able to comment as well.
The chair of the board of university governors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the experience of the students," she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not at all sufficient: the union demands a legal right for each student with the Bachelor’s degree the possibility of accessing a further Master’s degree.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there will in the future be enough study places for Masters with the best possible study conditions.
The federal states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But on increased access to the master’s degree, the Ministers of Education made no comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
“Entering and leaving Germany is virtually unchecked” says the first line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, then as a reader in a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was given several literature awards, in 1993 he gave memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he is director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he talked a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly, in early 1971.
“I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against the fear-provoking attempts of the Securitate,” Söllner concluded.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and his unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial dominance, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that highlights the abyss and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only an author, but also a victim.
In his file of Securitate IM Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him in all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this assertion,” he said.
Söllner’s statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not astonishing as much.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies from the Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller wrote as early as July in the weekly "Zeit" after reading her own 914-page file.
Those involved probably speculated and in some cases knew what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the dealing with the control files by Securitate is still quite diffuse.
Systematic clarification has been boycotted and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the Enlightenment of the Records of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler Authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the records since then is more of a trail.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, after the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disgustingly of the decorated.
“She has psychosis,” she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be shown without turning in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there are silent faults.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession leaves the hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the craving for knowledge and not so much by the adjudication of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB soccer team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it gave the impression that a member of the elegantly dressed outdoor service was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had handed out samples.
The man of the characteristic bald had hired a driver, because he did not yet know the city.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we reached the eighths of the final", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" awaited them the next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "royal classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sweepstakes
The Champions League round of 8 (round-trip games on 16/17 and 23/24 February/round-trip games 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy of the dazzling entry of Babbel’s successor was limited.
Not only in the so-called savior, who in a short time had inspired the bewildered pros of Stuttgart self-confidence, willingness to surrender and a taste for the game.
I went to the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more thrown, explained soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with therapist Babbel had no longer worked.
He deployed a certain magic, Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann accepted, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to an injury quickly advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the perceived "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what had been missing, obviously, when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not passed the test yet, sports manager Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart above all needs constancy.
Like Gross, players and the manager also refrained from overestimating the victory against a defense weakened by lack of relays and totally overtaken by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And CEO Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been reached, the other was still far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt had no desire to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were re-updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been awarded by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had blamed weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change coaches under pressure from teenage fans.
Lehmann also called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility that he had eliminated his day off after the games.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt replied, announcing consequences for the backman.
They will probably not be friends forever, the two forty-somethings.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that without the previous efforts with the team of the substituted coach, the show of great game and battle strength would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important share in success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
Category: World Heavyweight Championships
Burning grief in Bern: Again and again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provocating world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges’ trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version beat American Kevin Johnson on Friday night in Bern by unanimous points decision (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had hoped for could not be carried out.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first loss in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging over and over again the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right to his target.
Generally speaking, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as “horrible zombie,” who “can’t do anything.”
On weighing, the champion allowed himself to be tempted on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so that he could see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of nearly four years, he beat then Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without fighting.
That year, he beat Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in his title defenses.
In this fight I only received one blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
In the summer before, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September.
Allegedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused the Minister of Defense, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), of knowingly misleading.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast on ARD television, the head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The killing order would have been given without regard to the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the Afghan policy of the federal government, and whether the chancellorship, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The foreign ministry did not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there had also been doubts about the Ministry's presentation on the grounds for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely on the background of the attack on the convoys.
It had been officially said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it transcended that they had even pointed to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert would have asked in a letter for clarification of the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has not received an answer, it was said.
The ministry did not speak on Saturday about the reproaches being made, noting that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament’s commission of inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
In a waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill and drug addicts, the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can give ourselves unfettered to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, whoever experiences sleep-like states during waking, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often regarded in the modern Western world as a madman or drug addict, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drug addicts.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
The dream-modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, insanity.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Casta<0xC3><0xB1>eda, the states of shamanic possession, and the psychoses and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts often appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between insanity and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a wakeful state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness to the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, this dream was even "a psychosis, with all the misappropriate, misappropriate forms".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with blood-red faces, deformed, grinding their teeth.
They are chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Crying, malignant voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls out two stereo cables, ties them to form a hanging knot, and fixes them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a horn and puts the knot around the neck.
Jump. Jump.
The rope is loosened.
What a lesson for you!, the voices shout in a choir that blows his eardrums, "Go to the clinic and make you heal!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, in addition to being manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the lifetime of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, grandeur delusions, relationship disorders, or persecutive mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like dream, psychosis also opens the gates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning aimed at it.
At the same time he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Have experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, “the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is.”
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers it is still unclear why our brain makes cabriolets.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality provisionally.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes, there are also other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the trigger of a psychosis when a pre-disposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmitter system.
When the brain heats up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experiment with some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been compiling reports on hallucinations and visions for the past ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreal Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranioencephal trauma.
Surprisingly, and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or poorly inhibited; when our brain warms up, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also stimulus restriction, stress, love sickness or other brain states of exception.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren't for those pictures and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her astonished; no one, besides her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little weird dreamer, but Sarah K. Knows she's not dreaming.
She wakes up and goes and hears that guy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he can sometimes not follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains the mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the sleep to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, she does not know whether she is awake or dreaming, if the images she sees, the faces or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he yells at the figures.
Her parents and friends haven't told her anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is today 20 years old.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations disappeared.
Since she’s contacted psychologist Kasten via the Internet, she knows she’s not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a stimulus restriction, it is very likely that after a while they will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is vacant and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., the only child, was little afraid of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls dad since he uses reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "has place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
The boundary between sleep and hallucination
In this overly conscious world, imaginary experiences usually pathologize, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a harsh and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called Oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that they cannot subsequently differentiate from being awake.
Dream conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully aware.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor incapacity, this replaces a very dangerous real situation with an own and imaginary world that is detached from reality.
A form of borderline situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change of world, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unendurable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his dreamlike experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on multi-day trips after a heart valve surgery with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility in the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he found himself lying in bed, an elderly man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching over his health.
It was seen in the early Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and encountered a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describes your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our everyday experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the oneirism, psychoses, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes, “can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
The children will take over the publisher at the age of 27.
The new publisher Kallen has come to an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding company will also be owned by the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm willingness to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been fixed as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will be actively involved in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
One cannot put before 7,500 workers their children, if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end both the children and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from the chairmanship of the board of directors starting in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This 52-year-old member of the Kallen family has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
After Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure, he also took over direct marketing, foreign marketing, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the peak of the publishing house.
Burda's sons are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding company will also be owned by the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are not safe from decay either: "This has always affected families who are infected by the craving for capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I’ve never had “deliriums of greatness,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor for this country, like Springer was, and I don’t want to play with Time in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Comprehensive beauty
Everything you can desire - in terms of beauty and well-being - at your fingertips.
This is what seems to have been proposed by El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the commercial center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and pampering of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which handles laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where tea stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxion.
In total, they are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibration platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
His director says that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles in the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where hair recovery rituals, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Varied necklines
Christmas is approaching and it is never too late to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party costume.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we should take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'Oficina LIVE'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electric Cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
This is intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, envisions "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has implemented throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production plants," the president of the Government said.
“Thanks to this plan and the readiness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The chief executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "by 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Salon will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the engine munto.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the classic engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Participating companies will include, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, automobile sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of automobiles; or Car Classics, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Ability Testing Abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be complemented by parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and contests.
Skill tests will also be carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on an enabled circuit outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda wants to show that sports are not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated in the Mazda3 the stop and start system of the engine - dubbed i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the gasoline 2.0 engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good rating achieved overall.
The finishes, the finishing of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver’s seat, we see that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and support.
The touch of the steering wheel is also exquisite.
Continuing with the set made up of the instrument box and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with lots of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the passenger compartment, this Japanese compact car features more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to this is a large trunk with regular shapes.
The automatic stop and start system of the engine, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-liter 150-horsepower gasoline engine and with the six-speed manual shift.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its low rumor, for its performance and for achieving a contained consumption.
And although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not run a large number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high driving comfort, and for its contained consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, which incorporates a greater number of standard elements.
From the standard equipment stands out especially the lane shift assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, if not enough equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: bixenon adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in its category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for its behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this version i-Stop, associated only with the gasoline engine 2.0 150 horsepower.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros of the proven version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day great doses of satisfaction.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexys' at the premiere of 'Nine'.
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as she is, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It’s just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price of about 12 euros per month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is like to give up data when crossing the border or desperately search for a cafeteria with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly appealing and it’s been going to have to be up and running for a long time.
Yes, some carriers have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission’s repeated ear pulls to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside of the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (it is still curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of tariffs means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no pipes.
It is a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a purchase option with lifetime access like the one Peek already has in the US.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it’s a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the American first lady.
If he already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color – greenish yellow with bright reflections – both times the outfit was composed of three pieces – dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric – and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaur.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration of treat it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with print.
The accessories have also varied: green half-heeled shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one picked up on this occasion, mane releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Feducation and career path of women in Spain', developed by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of living together as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, start living together as a couple, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
By contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
“Women aged 35 to 49 with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after the beginning of cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time of their life trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity but less on the timing of pairing," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when getting married and having the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the older the age at which they are married and at which they have the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher studies were first mothers at 25.1 and 32.1 on average, respectively.
"There is also another division between women based on their level of education.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and prioritize getting a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become an image of different products of the brand, singing the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, thus joins other famous signings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the men's segment, the cosmetic brand also features luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangine's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met at the annual awards ceremony, held in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Best Model of the Year.
Poker by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Poker of Aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearful genres (biographical likeness, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The trip has its excitement and Vicent does not spare scares or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
Here are some snapshots.
In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same one that I felt without name: pleasure against miserable destiny, blameless morality and innocence without any god.
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with dazzling, senseless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
“Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition.”
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north wall, from which the best climbers steep again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and others that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented scream cast from a bridge by that Munich character to carry his echo to the bottom of the twentieth century night in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed, ‘Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.’”
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort, / after the storm the harbour, / the rest after the war, / after the life satisfied pleases death.'"
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage she also brought her depressions.
The husband normally accepted her telling her that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
It has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja by Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct that man’s fame to serve as his own pedestal?”
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years old was walking around our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a mixed-race specimen, rescued from the kennel and weighing no more than six kilograms and, without a word, gave her two kicks that left the injured dog.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find the fun in a free assault on a small and defenseless animal, which, by the way, was tied up.
To this must be added the suffocation that provoked a lady who walked quietly and, when he insulted these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energetic who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event happened at 5 p.m. on any Tuesday through a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubted would serve a lot and not generate susceptibilities, just clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spaniards.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to mistreat a defenseless animal free of charge that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helmet use
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among younger drivers, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said the campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer and safer products every day, and said it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, since being a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safer products.
Increased sales of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of manufacturers Anfac and that of vendors Ganvam.
The good data, not osbtante, should be quarantined since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound of the last month, the accumulated registrations in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold plus all the vehicles that make up the tailored drawer of light commercials: derivatives of passenger cars, pick-up, vans, light vans and light trucks / chassis.
Likewise, the clouds that affect their demand the most have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, who pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
So, to the constraints of the closed tap of bank loans, we must add other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Faced with this picture and unlike passenger cars, the 2000E purchase aids have served little.
In addition to individuals, self-employed people and SMEs who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been testimony.
Just yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to devote special attention on the part of the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrial ones (trucks and buses).
The Vendors Association forecasts a 2010 similar to the end of the year, for which it calculates a drop in sales (from passenger cars and 4x4s) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-lock brakes and will pass with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of absence is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, by its way of working, it can also help prevent many collisions by range.
The emergency braking assistant does what it does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the step that the driver gives.
But this does not always maintain that pressure until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to step on the brakes before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance that the car uses to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided - when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting lightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum effort to the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors Delays Plan for Opel to January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably the 8th - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new prospective buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but gains strength from Dutch sports car maker Skyper, which is backed by Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year remains if it is not sold.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its latest, expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale by just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of canvas with manual drive, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they gained 7 kilos more; riding five inches of sporting baskets with the other 12 l.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door handles for ones of cloth, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the dual-clutch PDK gearbox, the test was performed on a unit with the six-speed manual gearbox, mainly on California secondary roads, on mountain stretches with really twisted tracks.
Their behavior can only be described as impeccable.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not step on the asphalt with plumbing.
Rather, quite the opposite: it was a long time since we had tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, it conveyed so much safety in the bend, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short walk for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and squeeze his motor again...
Thanks to its address, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very accomplished and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine noise, previously debuted on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from standstill or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was pretty punished, but the car digested the bumps well.
The electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, well in the morning.
In short, an ultra-light car, one of the most fun to drive that one can in the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate to Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'house' parades, the singer sprinkles her pouch face with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', she's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant 82-91 victory in their visit to the complicated court of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous losses that the team of Dusko Ivanovic counted, and in this way is placed in the lead of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team.
The Victorian team managed to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although he had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored, had a lot to do in the final victory.
The match started head-to-head for the Azulgranas, who put themselves from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter was already foreshadowing that they had jumped to the Israeli court with hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with cheers and applause on the return to his home, to continue to expand his advantage to the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'minus six' of Splitter's valuation already foreshadowed that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being on the road to the rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court no one wins, and with 'the hand of Elias' squeezing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellows' turning the luminous (50-49).
More inconveniences
Ivanovic's wounded but nonetheless dead, needed to spin a couple of plays with success to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a reassuring rent (54-67), who managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter.
The Alaveses went out to leave their skins in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what had been deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic's did not precipitate, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the game already had an owner and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries Prevent Battle of Unicaja
Unicaja lost in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the lead of the group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the losses of the boxers, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship and neither by the rival’s entity, perhaps one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, 13th minute, at which time an action, conato of fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, resulted in the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function showing its superiority within both zones, where the injury loss of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez, were ballasting the boxers.
Between the home players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the lead 44-32, minute 19.
An Impossible Return
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, showed superior and even came to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which caused the leader of the group to shake.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last loss of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis's contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when squeezed and given their superiority in centimeters within the area were unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to rebound the basket average 81-62, 37th minute, and the Unicaja went off, handing the lead to the Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads of real estate, jobs and engine in Spain.
The How Much Should You Collect? tool calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers available by Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data from Trovit’s search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross annually and one French, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 one Spanish receives.
Similarly, a driver charges 34.247 euros net annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by dependent, with 14,725 euros; and operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are driver jobs, part-time jobs and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has put a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, when his term of office would officially end.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy before that date, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destiny."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
Following the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately frustrated by rejecting Zelaya the status of political asylum that was intended to impose on him by the "de facto" government presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring when asset inflation has been the dominant focus in the markets, once again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct asset purchases and indirectly giving liquidity-free rates near-zero for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are starting to throw some sand in the gears as the ECB did with its auction year-on-year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain the economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reductions.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have picked up again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Once again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the spreads of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go wrong to silence moral risk advocates who were trying to re-establish conscience charges over those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving day.
However, what is in Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to rebuild power in the emirates and what is in Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to make its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing an episode of normalization of the transient risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected limits.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads expand as do European corporate bonds, we should not be worried.
If European spreads decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor’s is an anecdote: When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review up their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the load with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not foresee much life expectancy at their warning.
Again, it has all the paint that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "caution, friend driver".

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is being debated these days.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushstrokes of what he had raised in the closed subcommittee.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion euros between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants are kept open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be $60 billion, but up to $95 billion.
Of course, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be destined to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue will change and power will already have to increase.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, he considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, yes, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Bill just passed by the government is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "punctual" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should begin to be made since they are slow to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-based airport services, Swissport, will play the role of the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, from which economic terms have not transcended, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Center for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the center’s tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona contests its first motorway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concessional highway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a motorway builder and concessionaire.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to advance the project, in a business plan protected by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
Waiting for their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase compete three consortia with a remarkable presence of European builders.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in Liza, and its peers are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium plays against the Acciona team, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where share capital the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn owned by ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specializing in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large works and privatizations, but it carries a clear entry difficulty if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger have followed, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Barely ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for raising and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate these two areas and leverage synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called the Northern Link (north link), is called to link the western Toowong highway with the Kelvin Grove ring road (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel and is the largest action to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The calendar set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not anticipated that the work will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute $500 million (€308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane now offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear notable fruits to Hochtief, who announced yesterday the obtaining of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and give the German job for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane, which was still under construction and Hochtief has closed the sale for 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC awards tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia worth 64.5 million euros.
The firm gets this contract days after taking over the construction of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its expertise in tunnel construction.
The construction is scheduled to commence in early 2010 and its execution period will be extended to 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore Awards Renfe Advertising
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services over the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that submitted to the competition called by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined $63 million for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euros to France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programs outside of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for blocking its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a repeat offense.
App Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club that have won the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory; it is also one of the main sources of revenue for big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out well from this cast.
The white club has been the third on the continent that has earned the most money to participate, and the only one, alongside AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also billed more money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both of them to Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution (distribution)
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA’s complicated money-sharing procedure.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini is planning to raise 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will devote 413.1 million to the fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, plus another 550,000 euros for each game they play.
There are also bonuses for winning (€800,000) and tie (€400,000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the eight fourth finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be pocketed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the finalist’s 5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main languages, and has four assigned seats.
The champion of the previous year gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches to be played in this year’s edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group unraveled yesterday the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public takeover bid (opa) for all the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be rewarded with an interest for this deferral of 1% annually
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it was not informed of the offer, even though the company of the Ruiz Mateos claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If made, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his leadership.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and the judicial twists of their former managers, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group chairman.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company is still immersed in the legal battle over the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will reveal new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Hearing and affirmed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV authorizes the Paternina exclusion opa presented by Investor Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion deal presented by Investor Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorises this transaction on the understanding that its terms are in accordance with the current rules and considers the content of the explanatory leaflet presented after the amendments introduced on December 2nd.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transferred in any way until the completion of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New tools for car experts
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a crash are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the repair cost will be.
No claim is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Calculate manually the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools it would be a matter of minutes.
That’s why nearly 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, then elaborate it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other companies competing in the field of valuation and information tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Director of Audatex, in Spain, they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that more versions, variants and motorizations have been released in the last five years than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very arduous job, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter their price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image is made of each model where different parts of tourism can be "painted".
If it is a massive wind model, the work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile fleet that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually experts in mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in developing these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data is included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for scrap parts management or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of used ones in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
Given the products Audatex offers, it is easy to get an idea of the kind of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the flagship product AudaPlus, the standard claim assessment solution, intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Afterwards, each insurance company, which performs thousands of assessments, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on the windows of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows bidding for vehicles declared total disaster.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or knowing deviations by brand or model.
It can be studied, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious injuries in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or official prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown or maintenance of the automobile.

Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding the replacement, creating a budget and generating a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with internet connection is required to use it.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears, and then the required replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the quote to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalog of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the interior face.
