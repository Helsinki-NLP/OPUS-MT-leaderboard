Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will be awarded to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The plan for the presidential couple then includes an interview with Norway’s King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the award, but only the third to be awarded within the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to stress.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate it to charities, but he has not yet decided concretely which ones.
His busy program then took him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at that price at first.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not fully deserve it.
He has also repeated several times that this is not a prize for himself alone, but for all those who stand up for the same values as him.
At the time of the announcement, he said it would be an “invitation to act.”
Nature defender accused of blackmail
Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police have charged with blackmailing the president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokeswoman for Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice is Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in detention and at risk of up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you find sorting bins at every corner.
What about Brno?
It would take you several minutes to find the right dumpsters.
I don't mean that we wouldn't sort out the rubbish in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that the city councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of waste sorting not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of bins dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found for the moment is the Moravian square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues would not please me, but it seems to me damn little.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it is not a sinecure either.
So in the end, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
Laziness.
It makes them a jog to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw away some glass and PVC bottles.
Except I didn't see any colored dumpsters on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately I found the right place by taking the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It is after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city the best, right?!
It is probably that ecology and an alleged aestheticism do not interest the Brno socialists too much.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first league of hockey that embarrasses the city across the country, instead of buying a few extra bins and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after dragging on the internet for a while.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
The budget of Paroubek has removed the money pensions and sick leave
After the left has grown, despite the advice of the government, farmers or officials there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says finance minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the government making loans for sensitive expenses, pensions, or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems off later, undermining the ground," Janota said.
It should be noted that on borrowed money the interest to be paid is increasing and that it will sooner or later have to be returned.
The state doesn’t really have a choice as to where to get money.
If it does not reduce social assistance or its spending, it will have to raise taxes.
To all those that the left has now grown: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and don’t have to fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the state - next year it will not lack 163 billion in the cash registers, but more.
In spite of Minister Janota’s efforts, debt will grow faster and faster, and with it, interest-related expenses.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to raise VAT slightly or lower maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
It will also miss $5 billion to complete road and rail construction due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and begun and for which it is not possible to modify projects in order to possibly reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major construction sites, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very skillfully - it will draw on the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ (electricity supplier and distributor), which the state owns for the most part and will supply the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were navigated from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GNP under EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department's side or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortage of one hundred million dollars for the two-billion-dollar state fund project, which is meant to allow online tracking of the expenditures of each administration.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are contemplating a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you can switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to devices by 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
Deserted runways are no problem only for lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking ski holidays in hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they will immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate to book too much.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait a few more days.
<0xC5><0xA0>pindler hoteliers currently only offer one-week New Year’s Eve holidays.
I think they will try again for a while to place them, but they will also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease,” Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter seasons.
We are most interested in the Christmas week at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we have already prepared some cheaper last-minute holidays for Christmas,” said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer free spaces.
The first fourteen days of February start just as well, the remaining winter holidays sell average.
This year, interest in winter holidays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes cover during the week, Christmas will also be complete,” Schiefert thinks.
Conversely, the occupancy of Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places left for New Year’s Eve as well as Christmas.
There is a lot of interest during the holidays of January of the Polish and February sells well too," says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Hotel Omnia near the central car park of Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> is also complete to eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupation at the present time.
February is a bit weaker for now but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will certainly grow again, said the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, hoteliers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rainfall, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But afterwards, the weather is expected to warm up, reports Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It even becomes comical, the diligent effort with which Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of wise, reproduces his predecessor’s strategy on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered simple.
When he ended up sweating his long-awaited doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "like in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A New Way Forward."
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into a civil war-consumed Iraq as “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences.”
The following months, however, have shown that Bush's strategy, emanating from the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that said, objectively speaking, he left his successor in a much more favorable final situation than we could have hoped.
Barack Obama hopes the miracle will happen again in Afghanistan
It was once again campaign commanders who asked for an increase in the military contingent, including Afghan Operation Commander General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite subordination habits.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but, in the absence of a better option, he cheated at least the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He succeeded in withdrawing the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it originally counted on 10,000.
The most problematic thing about Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt the fact that a half-increase will bear the same fruits as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out by the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
In these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders on a day-to-day basis according to their arrangements.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only dust in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is unusually complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity on the relationships, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a “quick state to act,” which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy makes him perplexed by his voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the verge of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out-of-reality heart can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of the war with a view to their "rapid return home" will bring there a true miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans’ willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is oriented towards the negative.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their voters why security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
This will have to be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution will, however, lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only problem for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this in response to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
The shares can be withdrawn from the leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link remuneration with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global sense to take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the advent of the financial crisis, high banking premiums have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to allocate a single 50 percent tax on bankers' bonuses in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
Five women, a record number, today in Stockholm received the Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and literature from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustav.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes together with their compatriot Jack Szostak.
The Chemistry Prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn’t win this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with William Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each laureate has received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary award.
This reaches ten million Swedish kronor in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has more than one winner, they will share the reward with each other.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been presented this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward as he is only at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
To the discharge of his policy he added that in some situations war is indispensable for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who weights his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was voted by the House of Representatives
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticized the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the public finance crisis.
It was Presidential Spokesperson Radim Ochvat who informed of the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss her role with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget legislation to be submitted for Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the House of Representatives on Wednesday validated the proposals of the left on money transfers and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the Social Democrats' proposals that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a disagreement that calls into question the future of Fischer’s cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the SDG, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by MEPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by Fischer's government and that it must curb the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but does not require it, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that politicians have long overlooked the "serious problem" of the "irreprehensible deficit" of public finances.
At present, he said, there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could bring about improvement, if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
SDG President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is frightening and that the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words “drastic verdicts.”
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is frightening and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism that the lead roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invincible will expose the world a lot about the country, its struggles and its victories.
The story is about sport, relationships between races and Nelson Mandela.
Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman plays the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a ninety-eight-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I have to embody you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's Milion Dollar Baby drama set in the middle of boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of an anti-slavery movement himself became a slave, a fictitious president of the United States, and even God for the most important man in the film, Evan Almighty, but never anyone.
The former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his hard work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country remains still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders to the world rank.
The South African team will eventually progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role in a way that would bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I felt like I know how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in rugby’s tough midfield.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, ‘I look much bigger in the movie.’”
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the direction of director Eastwood received positive opinions and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed above Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only acknowledged yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava" type missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly, or it was damaged in the middle of the flight.
Russian newspapers talk about "Bulava" as "the missile that does not fly"
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th trial was going on normally at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the aircraft again.
It is obviously the third-stage engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij that was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired precisely from a moving boat and immersed
This is the reason why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a defective "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage hit only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the Department of Defense management considered that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they still claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetissov will appear again in a professional game at 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entry already during Friday’s game against Petrograd.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliah we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have some details on the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetisov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as the World Junior Championship.
In the second half of his career, he also earned tributes in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Hyundai factory spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k confirmed this.
However, the management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, which is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, knowing that there would be two teams, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz said the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of Saturday's team.
It will also be awarded later for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can apply for a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their end-of-year holidays, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and demands of unions and employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, employees at the car factory were forced to work almost two overtime hours a day in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the automobile factory and the unions is scheduled to take place Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday they were ready to end the state of strike should they agree on their demands and sign a joint document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees went on strike spontaneously because of incessant overtime.
They also protested against the poor wage conditions and so-called ducking.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work extra to meet the imperatives of automobile production.
In the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also demanded that workers who have ceased production be subject to no sanctions.
The unions are asking the company to reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (209 € or so) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles by September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "during" HIV viruses also
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new combinations that can slow the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality, in some cases, takes precedence over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the moment.
However, the life of patients can be drastically prolonged through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption has a number of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of the development of so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to deal with resistance to the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metallocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "enhanced" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings to virus proteins.
Metallocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, there would be no mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop HIV protease, we will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers said in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test pieces as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metallocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, are therefore interesting combinations to examine further in order to move towards the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry.
The SDG is attacking Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek called the budget ratified for the following year "awesome" and he said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS’s remarks a drastic verdict.
He says he takes some time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the head of government should decide whether he wants the House of Representatives to support the minority that is concerned with tackling the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about staying in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned that the positions of the SDG and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday ratified the budget for 2010, with proposals for amendments to the amount of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House has increased the amount of money for civil servants' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint about the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, obedient to the government's wish that an amended budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after his passage to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering if he would remain in his office.
His disappointment in the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that the representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who imposed the budget changes, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other deficit-increasing laws such as health insurance, pensions, or reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDG are not involved.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the SDG have done nothing harmful, Topolánek said in a statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are claiming TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of fighting the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the House to journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew off in the afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The SDG has reversed at the request of the Prime Minister.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed at the same time that the SDG would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday had it not explicitly asked Democratic MPs to allow the vote on the budget.
We don't feel like we're orphans, we're not small children," he said, responding to the question of whether the SDS had not been blamed by the Speaker of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missing.
I knew already at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the months that followed would be a Bolshevization of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek responded in person.
According to the new schedules of the <0xC4><0x8C>D there will be fewer trains for the same rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit some less loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and will instead strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will decrease by 2% on the day the new schedules come into force compared to today.
Most pricing will not change, including base rates and discounted rates.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport is in the Hradec Králové region by a total of eight per cent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line are also cancelled and the traffic of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the greatest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburb system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague’s main train station (Praha Hlavní nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í).
The <0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
This year’s invoice for regional railways: an additional 200 million crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transportation and will pay the Railways a total of 4 billion crowns next year to settle visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of 8 billion next year, with the knowledge that the state will participate in the amount of nearly 3 billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways recently signed a ten-year contract, until now the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they have not resorted to a price increase on the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will only affect <0xC4><0x8C>D Net day tickets and eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka discounted internet tickets.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will newly depend on the route traveled, whereas until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a one-time rate of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary school pupils and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed, but that spoke at the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 rebels have reportedly used the hostages as human shields during a flight to the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused during a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the southern province of Maguindanao because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in American theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>ený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned fighter against apartheid has returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback of the critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film holds high hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in the midst of preparations for the World Cup, and on the other hand because the media is agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP, the reactions to the new film are at the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations made to the main roles where Hollywood stars "pavain".
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have prepared well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to be able to - as they say - recover from his energy, he said at the film's official premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember Mandela’s personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual, he added.
Wearing the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people portrays the South African human rights defender during his tenure as president.
Morgan Freeman tries to regroup two racial groups from a long-divided population, and just like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters wearing the South African national team jersey on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
For showing up on the lawn in a jersey, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been long ovated fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into a single nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
The South African whites are however skeptical as confided recently in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps of the distribution center near the municipality of Vý<0xC5><0xA1>kov na Lounsku.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, spokesman for <0xC3><0x9A>stí firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission unit.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, <0xC4><0x8C>eps has not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electricity supplies have not been interrupted, says the spokeswoman of the company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ for Northern Bohemia So<0xC5><0x88>a Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps is the exclusive operator in Czech territory of transmission assemblies and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transport assemblies to the distribution assemblies and line paths with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to sue three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD prefects for defamation
Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, owner of Student Agency, will file a defamation complaint against three Social Democratic prefects today.
And specifically against Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura indicated this in Dvacet minut of Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us have attacked us and say that we are making the fine mouths, while we have only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander about the company Student Agency, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
Likewise, he said he had evidence that no region had done so in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers that Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s complaint represents the continuation of his media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek says.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable actions of the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he plans to resume it after New Year's Eve.
He said the campaign will focus on corruption in the broader sense.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the railway connections for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such a way of acting is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura threats from a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I do not know who it is, but I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices rising, saying mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal infections.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year already a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal infections.
However, the parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between 300 and 450,000 crowns a year on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
Until now, the state has spent about 500,000 crowns a year on all children’s vaccinations.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcus is the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, some 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
As of January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that must now be followed, Kalovský said.
But the health ministry does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are absolutely not considering it at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that vaccination based on volunteerism is flawed.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a reduction in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," Cabrnochová said.
As of next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break from the fact that it is the first child vaccination that is funded by insurance and not by the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products.
This, however, is related to the concerns of pediatric practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct the amounts of health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
It is estimated that pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta’s son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million in his father’s museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) reported.
AP cited a police official as saying the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to “enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility,” the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies having given such authorization, the agency said.
Labour is advocating the increase in the budgetary tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also drew lightning by tackling low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a 1% ceiling on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The unions have protested that low wages are penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and have warned that "problems" are announcing.
The decrease in social insurance - which will get about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year - has made the business world angry, because he says it's a job tax while the goal should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small companies has been abandoned
Rebate of taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 per year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110 more.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 led to "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the first 5% of employees.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms refuted a tax increase and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "drop of water into the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and that growth in the economy would restart by the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely decline by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the pre-estimate.
"Missed Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday warning against Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the project to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" avoiding difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything meaningful about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Treasury Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
“Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of who wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to Tory’s proposals that would result in a faster and greater reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through higher taxes and lower spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on wind."
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said the timing of the announcements - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing accusations of propaganda, with the money simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not release spending details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that government spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor’s figures mean substantial reductions in many areas in the future, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“The pain is actually only postponed,” said its Director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner,” added Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s Accounting Advisor.
"This was a fake pre-budget report. Markets are well aware of it."
FBI Investigates ‘Arrests of Americans in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani ancestry, one of Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are being detained,” said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said the house was already under surveillance by local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined any comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the United States should “work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing from their homes by their families in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian ‘abuse’
In the last twenty years, human rights have been respected as little as ever, according to the report of Amnesty International.
The report presents "repeats of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man cited in the report claimed he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes; another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities said such criticism was politically motivated.
Thousands were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the start of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate in the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and the parliamentary committee’s results had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in order to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn the Bristol site into a race track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowborders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park runway, a small stepping stone preceded a 100m long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was gorgeous but it was pretty intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shining below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prizes have rewarded the best voltiges - or figures made on the track.
After the Thursday night party, the snow will be abandoned at the melt.

Some readers will be drawn to this new book, admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls “Muslim spaces” for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not pushing the debate to the end.
The Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their Sunni purist Islam counterparts associated with Saudi Arabia, which nowadays make up a small part of Europe's Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French might be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the intellectual guardian elite so virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves in hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave 14-year-old aspirant who had only to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their newly killed mother, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous spectacle gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally one millionth of the area needed for a free adult. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has turned green due to the algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often comes back to the threat of hunters to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians on motoski use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will stay the longest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse into what the future might look like there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of changes.
It's not for failing to try.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering voyages provided the first information about the melting of the ice cap.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the underground relief changes.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by brackish water nets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it may be our turn.
Marines among 6,000 people who laid crowns on graves in Arlington
First class De'Angelo Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus ride to drop a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers to gather Saturday morning to lay crowns on veterans’ graves in different sections of Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
This is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Built in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, because these are not as often visited as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples held hands, wearing the fresh pine crowns over the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on the top.
Close by, there was silence over Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned to see the small black and white information cards, plunged into the wet soil for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears at her son’s grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and had driven eight hours to collect at the grave of Marine Gunnery Sergeant Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget what we are free for...my son paid for it, she said.
“Long after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The accusations have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being “dangerous”.
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, entail the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husbands and women are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but has always been denied permission.
The detention of a U.S. national may increase tensions between the Communist Brotherhood government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a “soft” approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, so that the U.S. can return the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day’s salary.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often must communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press attaché to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- distributing mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas Program at Human Rights Watch, which recently released a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick elder brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, put on trial and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when the two countries are beginning to initiate a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly preparing a plot to send five North Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill US troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who scrutinize the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
Investigators claimed they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani secret service representative who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast that became a refuge from terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of keeping anonymity due to the confidentiality of the case.
The official said the men were determined and still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to enter al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI -- emphasize the crucial role recruiters play in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. secret service has had priority to infiltrate men into the al-Qaeda network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of barrier guards, denying entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are being studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups also need to pay more and more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in terms of their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow their recruiting pattern that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of Thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen Call for Climate Action
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched on the streets here on Saturday, calling for greater climate action from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little has happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists have marched around the city, rolling out signs in English saying ‘There is no planet B’ and one in Spanish, declaring ‘The Earth says it’s done.’
Several celebrities joined the protests, including top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to his mother’s homeland, Peru, opened his eyes to the heartbreaking problems the country faces due to the impact of climate change already happening.
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to get the word out and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate talks, activists wearing black masks and clothing lit several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were throwing them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it appears that the protesters have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
Asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring, “The event being important, I can’t hear what’s going on outside.”
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful depending on the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
Test results reveal tenacious gaps between races
Last week’s federal report on mathematics outcomes brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District is still far behind the leading establishments, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in much greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington D.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference only decreased to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by group head of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean we've raised the aggregate by looking at the elements at the top of the ladder, which is problematic and annoying, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in District education.
I’m not jumping for a point or two,” said Kwame R. Brown, a D.C. board member whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said the message from the test results is that the city’s middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what’s scary is that we don’t spend enough time and energy on our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needed to continue to find better ways to meet the needs of struggling students.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at elementary and early school students who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their school journey and who are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the mathematics program, for classes from Kindergarten to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer better interventions to these lower-than-class students," Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise overall system outcomes while providing money and resources for less successful schools to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Therefore, this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like other school superintendents, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focused on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they come from, can be assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the essential elements to narrow the success gap was the length of traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" to get a further increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and blinks a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition is $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of an impressed than an enthusiastic new student.
"That's where I'm going to study!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, while the guide was directing them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she said dreamy, when she was told the low ratio of law professor to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to college:
The question is where.
While this question still arises widely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands of them benefiting from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five Hispanics of the "second generation" pursues high school -- a notable success considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study the batters claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need for success.
Many parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue through the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry gets deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure in two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies left with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who put in an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies have been awarded contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asian and European companies that are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military troops retreated have hampered US oil companies, preventing them from entering more forcefully into Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who had strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided their technical advice, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. bied more on contracts than other companies and left with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be on equal footing with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit auctions made bids that were then compared to the barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda allegedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile hit along the border with Afghanistan killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, U.S. counter-espionage authorities said Friday.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA inside Pakistan’s anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistan’s civilian secret service, speaking on Miran Shah’s phone.
Officials said suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what remained of the “totally shredded bodies.”
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the military organizers of al-Qaeda who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize conspiracies around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
It followed the strategic directions of al-Qaeda leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somalia had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaeda and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general American public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official representative said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major figure in al-Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a nonprofit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have advanced to lessen their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The UN special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate tainted with allegations of widespread corruption during the UN-backed presidential elections.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the U.S. timetable for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials aiding the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply honor the commitment he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there had been a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already begun looking for a replacement.
Representatives say the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but said that Galbraith's accusations -- which was thanked -- "have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism about international election observance."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate U.S. forces relief in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than is allocated to the mission in Afghanistan, saying it would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy UN hiring regulations hampered his ability to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's major powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of 300 US troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a outcome."
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I’ve learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it’s the unpredictable side of war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some of these sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said a “set of motives and punishments” might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons because “his people would suffer immensely” from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face “probable” consequences if it does not bring back its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment solely for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant part of its storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed for such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran’s stiffness in the face of some of the international community’s proposals for which they had actually agreed in early October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to join in on what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turns to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement made Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "baseless allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the heads of troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions continue between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of Kurdistan's regional government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In the aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching to them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "One more baby is one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate in their city and by the aging population, radically changed direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no seconds left, said Wang, 31, Human Resources Director, who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell by 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the registered resident population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said fertile couples must have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of labor in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Gradual mitigation
Drafted in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is to date undoubtedly the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and face discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese authorities have given the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women with a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boy-girl ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who is entitled to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slide leaflets under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wish to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural suburban city in Shanghai say they saw an increase in requests for records from couples wishing a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu commune, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said that she only wanted a single child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone taking care of us."
We’re not used to taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it more boldly.
For middle-class couples working in pairs, which lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to succeed.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space issues -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you have to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for emission reduction
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- so far characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- came back under the ramp on Friday, due to the release of a document highlighting the ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the charge, in the next 40 years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as well as shed light on the way forward.
But it has been seen as a major step forward in time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Written by a special UN working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, in the long run and in the long run.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that officials would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN Executive Secretary-General on climate change Yvo de Boer described as “the full picture.”
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 percent to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 percent to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also revived negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand flooding and drought or to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Climate Negotiation Representative, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts of major emerging economies, if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is getting harder on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States is not going to sign an agreement without efforts and actions from major developing countries, Stern said, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after China's deputy foreign minister He Yafei said the US chief negotiator either lacked "good sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not financially help China to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about rescuing individual economies than rescuing the planet, with China and the United States quarreling over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of decreasing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold major emitters accountable for their actions.
It’s really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Adviser for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission's climate unit, said the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the entire political process", partly because they are now unified and they are calling on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on solving most of the outstanding issues before heads of government reached an agreement.
Senior officials such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh, and the Chinese Deputy Minister got off their planes and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and news conferences in order to make claims that will be investigated in the following week.
The real picture of the rally -- where 13,000 people enter and leave the Congress Hall every day -- guitar-playing activists show nighttime shows mocking countries that they say betray each other and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than via email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the greats, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy at Conservation International.
The heavy trucks are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m., Monday morning, a whistle will pierce through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will depart from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Small holes lost will become thriving suburban cities, business travel will be much shorter, and the transition from airplane and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of dangers to the environment are likely to curb Britain’s high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line between London and the West Midlands will be designed within five meters of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment could be controversial.
In the countryside, the map will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final itinerary.
HS2 is also expected to introduce three options for a larger, northbound high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast, towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It looks like it will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When finished, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour-long journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK’s fastest network in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can travel on one line London - Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Given the space constraints, it is planned that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Experts in the rail industry state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes the project needs to be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if he launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best for ensuring a transition from planes to trains, providing a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, senior member of Tory's parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his constituency home.
The party leader, who was downgraded by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were “understanding,” raised his loan of <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been allowed to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a member spending control. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his riding of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room, and dining room, but the Emolument Office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
The neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into his pre-borrowing arrangements.
The Committee released him last month on any charges of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of borrowing <0xC2><0xA3>271.406 from his London property to the constituency house he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Duncan claimed approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The RBS variable standard interest rate rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The most recent publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to demand <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as Head of Ghost Cabinet in September after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him stating that members of parliament must survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated like "m...e"
He said, “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small portion, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil dealer, began having to explain his expenses, in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fee office that it "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3>-shaped hole in Mr. Duncan’s lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had claimed <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with theft or drafting or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn’t be clearer or simpler.”
Faithful, come see the Brighton Advent Calendar
Brighton Beach Cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each December day, using as a theme, Christmas songs.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., each day, with pates and hot wine served free of charge.
Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël", for which the booth features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
“The idea of the beach cabin Advent calendar came right after a conversation with a few friends during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent that through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, across the world and in Copenhagen, where police carried out several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, about 100,000 according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is tasked with reaching a deal that can enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has contributed to making "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
Incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the procession left, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, a reporter for AFP said.
Anti-riot police immediately intervened relentlessly.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the "Black Blocs", those ultra-violent groups that had illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the protest, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", noting that about 100 of them "were still held on the street Saturday night "handcuffed and kept in a seated position despite the extreme cold."
The party of Parliament, the procession, rather good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by bus and train from the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue raincoat, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are taking to the streets to ask for reparation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you never did before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alt-globalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of alter-globalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to “break climate justice and social justice”: “Today, there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world”.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas touting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters also held to call for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a 'farce'
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, as Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout rate was 58% a few hours before the closing, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first preliminary results were to be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five contested candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically rejected the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
This election is a farce.
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, by the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are set up all over this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district leader, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the course of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, especially the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
"I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations," said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticize the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one ceding control over Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police on the fringe arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that is due to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The party of Parliament, the procession, overall good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without attempting to enter.
A scene had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, fully dressed in black, wearing bricks and hammers, smashed windows, a reporter for AFP said.
Anti-riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened relentlessly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", the ultra-violent groups that had illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We have the extremist groups in sight, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen had warned, while the helicopters of the police were turning in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, coming by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue raincoat, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are taking to the streets to ask for reparation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, there are rivers where you can walk when you've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alt-globalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alter-globalism, told AFP he came to Copenhagen to “break climate justice and social justice”: “Today, there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world.”
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, the former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas touting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters also held to call for action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The geo-history comes out of the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were coming out "strengthened" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in the scientific terminal.
From now on, primary students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "we have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L sectors cannot remain sub-sectors of the S, he continues, stressing: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant about the absence of terminal history-geography in technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll in Humanity found that nearly seven in ten Frenchmen (69%) disapproved of the government’s plan to remove compulsory education from geography-history in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized the suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The minister added, however, that there was "no question" of deleting the philosophy of the S-terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will cover their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will cover their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also follow in-situ internships during the M2 year and will be a first year in front of the students as internship teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist to National Education".
It also reaffirms the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
In Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, took up on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of expert speeches, each of fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, said an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of the day who derives his name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
Twenty speakers are chosen from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding global warming, “we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in minutes,” Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke without notes, but using graphs, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record".
Videos taken from these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly rate.
Delays in payments: anger of prison supervisors, planned actions
Prison watchdog unions called Friday for "general mobilization" to demand payment by the end of the year of premiums and overtime whose payment has been postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiary (2nd Union of Supervisors) has asked staff who will not be in service to protest Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and to "block them", to "denounce the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of overseers, the Federal Autonomous Union of Prisons (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Prison Administration Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all of them were budgeted, but ensure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors assuring them that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the staff to operate and modernize our prison system," the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the Prison Management to put in place without delay a package of measures to ensure that this situation, arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours, does not happen again in the future, Ms. Alliot-Marie adds.
The December pay will therefore be lean, except for management staff benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap / Unsa, for which "budgetary constraints have a good back".
This is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille was outraged, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of the month of October are not regularized in December, as well for overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the money of the staff, according to the CGT-Penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some being less disproportionate than others.
But anyway, the account is not there, noted the secretary general of Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Offers ‘Greater Tricks’ Than He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family at the White House, told Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule about gifts: "I give things nicer than the ones I get."
As part of a special show to be aired Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle provide insight into how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, noting that the dog "of course" would have a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama falsely opposed her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before replying humorously by pointing a finger at the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you this?”
During this one-hour, casual show, with the famous host who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama referred to a 10-speed bicycle, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father he rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember that time when I met my dad came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I didn’t really know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange them around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse,” said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday Reopened, RTL Says He's in Artificial Coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-opened in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL says the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the herniated disc suffered in Paris on November 26, his press service said in Paris, saying the injuries had "neededed a remedial operation".
The singer's press service, however, reassured himself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be released no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was allegedly plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he has opened an eye, RTL adds.
Asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of the Parc Monceau for this disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the arts.
This was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad thing," but said he wasn't worried about the rocker, who is "a fighter."
He had called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing twelve hours of flying after such an operation is not playable, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday “reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics” and that the infection was “contained.”
Mr. Camus also said he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer’s health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a crash on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on a "small colon cancer" and then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
Fans and journalists have noticed the singer’s difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage had even denied a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet's first on his fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medallist at the 2009 World Championships in a large basin, won an international title on Thursday on a distance that he particularly likes, the 50m free swimming, during the Euro-2009 in a small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a breakout.
One was upgraded by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 swims relays.
A regret for Bousquet, who was hovering over the world record of the 50m free, which he holds the mark in large pool (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m free, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisioned.
We can always dream better and in the end, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic in Istanbul, which hosted the first in 1999, in the same competition.
The use of the jumpsuits did not serve this time the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in large pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he holds on 400m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give up on this race.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Zola owned sarcophagus panel awarded US$1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded Thursday 1.5 million dollars, well above its estimate, announced the art dealer Sotheby's.
This front panel, two meters long and 63 cm high, dating from the 3rd century AD, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of Roman and Egyptian antiquity art auctions at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still underway but this lot is certainly the one that buyers have auctioned the most on so far, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in her Parisian mansion, and with Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
There remained a shaded area of about fifty years.
By searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "sequence Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Theresa Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted departure attempt from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico on Thursday considered that conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe conduct by the coup government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Migration Branch.
The coup government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad to grant him safe conduct.
But the deposed president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a guest incumbent head of state.
The coup government "has had a new failure in wanting me to renounce my office (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, about which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing some agreements the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a safe-conduct application to us, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, said Wednesday on the Honduran radio station HRN.
I do not seek asylum from any country, Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is headquartered in Caracas.
A possible departure of Honduras will have to be made as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors of Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president on Wednesday, who came to rally around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the coup government’s position.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21 and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" accused by the justice, according to the coup government.
President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya’s return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange rose on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures testifying to the resumption of activity from both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technologically dominant Nasdaq by 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index was awarded 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
There is good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focused on "half-full glass".
Avalon Partners' Peter Cardillo said investors focused on US trade balance figures, "which show that business is improving in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell in October by 7.6% compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expecting the opposite of a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of America’s main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell, a research firm at Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment enrolments in the United States rose against all odds last week to 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “has fallen to the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night and that of the 30-year Treasury bond to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of power supporters conjure up "Ladies in white"
A few hundred Cuban power supporters on Thursday conjured up the wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Around 40 women in white, wives or close relatives of political prisoners, were smuggled into the streets by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a reporter for AFP said.
Down the Yankees, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, with the fist raised, the proponents of power to the dissidents.
They were escorted by civilian officers who came to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by police officers in civilian hands, a reporter for AFP said.
Police forcefully drove dissidents into civilian vehicles who were conjured up by government supporters, according to the reporter.
The arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Winners of the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain under arrest.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” on the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionaries”.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced man kills 80-year-old with a knife and wounds five in Clichy-la-Garenne
A gunman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old and wounded five others in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne, Hauts-de-Seine, at an hour's rush, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly hit with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an 80-year-old, in or outside a pharmacy on 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, was learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Seriously wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The 30-year-old husband stepped in and was injured.
The first two victims, severely injured, were admitted to the hospital where the 80-year-old died.
The days of the other wounded are in danger, with vital organs apparently being affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became unwell and was reportedly hospitalized "in a state of shock," according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the control of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled into the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He allegedly wounded two passers-by, apparently at random: a thirty- and a forty-year-old, the latter severely.
The scenario was confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, an official of the Alliance union in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the force.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was strong, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal policemen, including their official, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person in his thirties arrived, wounded by knives.
These were national police personnel who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre has referred the investigation to the departmental judicial police department of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard as part of his custody.
A police source has not ruled out that he should be admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the forceful of this species whose forces multiply under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the abandonment of prosecution
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of the prosecutions against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of morals over 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the "Pianist", denounced before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal of serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I call for the charges to be dropped here and now, Hummel said, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, “was cold in the back.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- had discussed, before rendering his sentence, with a prosecutor who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved imprisonment -- which constitutes a serious failure to proceed.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells had finally declared in late September that he had "lied" to the documentary's author.
In the event that the court refused to drop the prosecution, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was pronounced, for "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Deputy Los Angeles County Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be there to appear at the hearing.”
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to flee?, asked Ms. Asayama.
The filmmaker “requests a favor from the court, while despising its authority.”
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out that "there are other alternatives to fleeing."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the abandonment of the prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also demanded, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client can no longer endure being harassed at every turn of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends up without direction, slowed by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a tumbling market between better-than-expected U.S. indicators and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the tech-dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve market opinion on the robustness of the economic recovery," summarized analysts Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also picked up sharply in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's preliminary index estimate.
Indices have, however, been hampered by a further increase in the dollar, at its two-month high against the euro, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," Deutsche Bank's Owen Fitzpatrick said.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% from 3.482% Wednesday night and that of the 30-year Treasury bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
Election of Miss World once again in South Africa
After a month of traveling across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross the last straight line on Saturday to fulfill their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great beauty mass held for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss sportive or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I’ve seen so many things and I’ve had so many experiences,” exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 5pm (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I’m happy to have experienced it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the warmth of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and presents in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It’s every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will march in traditional costume and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by a television presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
Candidates have like last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
They also met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I met people I never thought I could approach.
I’m definitely going to be back for the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi is excited about it.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive," says his son David.
The news of Johnny Hallyday is “very positive,” his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he was due to go to his father’s bedside hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it is going very well, told the press David Hallyday as he left the plane that was bringing him from Paris shortly after 13:00 locals (21:00 GMT).
The singer's relaxed son said he would travel "very quickly" to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following a herniated disc surgery in Paris on November 26.
"The singer was placed in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the news service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following the surgery of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from the intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, where their daughter Jade is schooled, to attend a school show, said an AFP photographer.
The head of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would go to Los Angeles on Monday with the singer.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the International Clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
I’ve heard of a possible legal process to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was "leaving far too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it stunned me, given that I had two disc hernias myself, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "left without drain, without anything," after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the arts.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practising at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resolve a hematoma following a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, condemned repeatedly by the courts, in medical liability files, as well as for tax fraud and scams.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and which is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said the intervention was "perfectly well" and post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The association UDF raises the tone and sums the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou's MoDem, reacted on Friday to the OPA attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former giscardian party, inviting him to no longer use it on any medium, under penalty of judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to retrieve the acronym UDF, deeming that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy before the NC National Council on Saturday.
In support of his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP past NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to file it in 2004 with the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou who do not intend to be dispossessed, came out of his silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and the deputy, ordering them to no longer use the acronym and to pass on ownership of the trademark to them, under penalty of judicial prosecution.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements that you are going to propose to your political movement to +reprise+ the acronym UDF, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it good to follow on your militant material and on the watch page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New center +, the slogan + today's UDF +, also note the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office, which is urging the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the UDF's name from any media and (its) website."
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to pass on the ownership of (the) trademark to its legitimate inheritors".
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they clarify that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "choosed" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
According to them, the New Centre has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF in 2007 voted to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of a bureau charged with defending the "material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of deposit of the acronym UDF to carry out it on his behalf.
This indelicateness is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironing about the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for itself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you do not have a right."
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier in order to determine, as accused by the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the eighty-year-old to rob her of a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this saga-worthy case about one of the wealthiest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Physicians appointed on Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010, stating in particular whether and at what periods Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she'll submit to it.
I will talk to her about it," Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, said at the outset of the hearing.
For his part, the lawyer of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is excellent news ... The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady that we have to protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has been prosecuting Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who she accuses of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court was due to examine the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' lawsuit, lawyers' pleas sometimes turned to the large family unpacking on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of the husband of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise, I've never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
For its part, the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre once again ruled that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge has refused in recent days to grant her application to initiate judicial protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity for legal action, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place,” prosecutor Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney said.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees, reminds the position of companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a matter of making employees adhere to determined "values" from above as it was in the past, to impose on consumers products thought by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the factors of customer preferences regularly comes back!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously jeopardizes the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that authoritarian management revenues totally contradict.
That’s why we call for a managerial revolution that would be to put employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incite this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I have been able to find that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally arrives, after many detours, to do priority... what it has always done.
- Secondly, because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Coming from major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "sic" of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, inappropriate to today's world.
Identifying and Measuring Mobilizing Factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises requires adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is possible only if it clearly appears as a way to realize part of their dreams, ambitions, projects.
Currently, only studies from the Functional Motive Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life plans.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilizing factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "in place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: 'Just War' Is Worth Right-wing Praise to Obama
The U.S. right on Friday welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of “just war” against U.S. enemies.
The Conservatives, who brokered the award to Mr. Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, like Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, a right-wing Republican, to USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the topic of “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “very good work” in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this speech quite historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected official, considered by some to be a possible Republican nomination candidate for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen “a left-wing president” remind members of the Nobel Committee “that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist.”
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush's reconverted columnist at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does," "he spoke like an American president," reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few right-wingers not to be convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "ternate, bulging and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When war is enveloped in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the slaughter of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained praiseworthy in the place of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech “overproduction” even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California daily said.
Obama “made the right speech,” the New York Times said, deeming it “both dark and uplifting.”
Roadsters: Three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organisation to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended the slogan of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" with this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, begun Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of agreement early in the morning.
And this even though three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took even more than six hours for a meeting to begin at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the end-of-year holidays," Bussereau said.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low wages, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're leaving from a very far distance, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
We are going to order our militants that there will be no blockade, no blockade of the supply centers.
But you can still have some recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", although it was "difficult to concede the increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke of an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel costs by 3%, and the holding of general conditions of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow, inter alia, to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros of employers' charges" has been the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance bill for 2009, voted on Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical terms."
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to companies that are members of this organization, and secondly to the entire profession, in the event of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Mr Bussereau assured.
The opposition of employers’ organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a “dumb market” because the 100 million euros “had already been pledged to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax.”
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, lamented the Unostra.
The agreement risks "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
Disturbances on the RER A, the largest urban transit line in France, will continue over the weekend, while a Friday meeting on the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP management left them hungry for their demand for premiums.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., at the rate of one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making efforts to serve the department stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains travelled during peak hours, and almost no trains during peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Francilians having organized themselves.
Thus, in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially due to the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he got up "an hour and thirty earlier, to be sure of arriving on time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned a supervision of officers and law enforcement.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "poor" by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The RRB Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RRB A on all aspects, working time, career path, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT was outraged, stressing that the management "was not destined to solve a problem while in the road drivers and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of practice of the profession," the RATP said.
This also caused the unions to say that the company "mocked the weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in the interest of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen at RRB B on Tuesday, after a notice has been filed by Unsa and Independents.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to a million daily travelers.
The drivers of the RER, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for delayed hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, decision heavy with consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by anger in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) has been disbanded because it has become a "focus of activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," court president Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 of the party's cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled MPs.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party says it has “no organic ties” to the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, in an attempt to dry up Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to an increase in tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
After the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP’s premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast populated by the majority of Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones with fronds.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deep down despair.”
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sandblasting service (FES) states that it is not to bother citizens.
This is simply so that agents can test the technology of vehicles and learn how to master them well.
And according to the meteorologists, this could well be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to tackle snow and ice.
The ESF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles run 20 main routes (called A routes).
This includes high-traffic streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
ESF officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of roads must be salted with a road foundation that adheres well, in a maximum of 3 hours.
This is why the FES service starts at 3 a.m. "so that the roads are cleared when the traffic of the daily migrations begins".
It gets harder when the snow starts falling at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, the head of the road clearing and sandblasting department tells us "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, we take care of access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The side lanes and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger is well aware that this always causes some complaints.
At five o’clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team set out to clear areas deemed dangerous and crossings as a priority.
As for bicycle paths, the FES services generally cannot deal with them.
Mr Brauburger said there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4:30 a.m.
As the ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service if necessary.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
The Tawa halde resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long to 1.50m high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull had sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would not have been exceptional.
But as reported by Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the earliest dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the land of the supercontinent, the Pangea, and was towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa illuminates a new day the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the relationships of kinship, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other palaeontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team tells that sometimes they find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
Excavations have uncovered the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indian word for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: Dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all palaeontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it confirms certain theories regarding the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the Sauriers were divided into three major evolutionary groups: theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaurus and velociraptor that appeared later and from which descend the birds, sauropods, long-necked quadrupeds, and those related to them and the herbivores such as the ornithopian species and snithischians.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the earliest theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues that suggest that the Tawa had small aerial bags in its bones at the level of the skull, as did the birds that are descendants of theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small airbags in its bones.
Since the lineage of the immense sauropods also had aerial bags and a light skeleton, it may be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the Sauriers had appeared there.
Consequently, the three great lines of evolution split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all of the land that formed the Pangea supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot be descended from a common ancestor who would have migrated, the researchers said.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a palaeontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the Silesaur, that lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how did the dinosaurs manage to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they provided a relatively rare collateral line of the reptilian branch, remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and with many other Saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread throughout the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs randomly survived while other reptiles allegedly disappeared.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favored meteorite flourished in a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and that since that time had been vegetating in the shade: these were mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by police of the J.W. Goethe University casino in Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University, as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America, express their solidarity with the protest students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police requested by the governing committee of the university.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike after walls and artworks were rubbed with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories said the degradations did not justify "so violent an intervention by the police commando against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses."
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable breach" of freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and tries to forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The Steering Committee of the University thus evaded the debates that would be indispensable.
The lecturers demand that the criminal proceedings initiated be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The youth of the Verdi trade union in the services sector and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, said Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) , she has taken cause and cause for the action initiated by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupancy and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU Regional Parliament Member Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (the Left) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Left)
Instead of reflecting on the arguments and demands of the students, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion that requires the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new “Silicon-Valley”
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the town has a reputation for being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
Important sites for production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As early as September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd established ties with Riedberg, the Frankfurt Science Centre – with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “Near Collaboration Protocol”.
The signatories were Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a lasting scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the rapidly expanding Russian market.
In contrast, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
There is the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The magnitude of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed sufficiently high.
For his supporters it is nothing less than “the new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate chaos of construction sites for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The main railway stations, with tracks that ended in the middle of the city, had a reputation at the time for being the relics of 19th-century transport technology that were the brakes of modern rail traffic because it took a long time to move the locomotives from behind to front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you need to do.
That is why the main railway stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Magistral railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project is really going to begin, although the visions of the 80s have long since been compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
Truth be told, head-of-line stations no longer pose any real entry and exit problems since there have been modern, reversible trains with autorails and pilot car at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies have won.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who is responsible for the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From the urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and section enlargement are designed for a traffic of people to which was attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s - enormous growth.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on increasing freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be engulfed in the project of the Swabia.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will be missing for other junction and congestion points in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the Rhine valley by 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom thoroughly here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking shoe.
The Rhine Valley route is on the way to becoming the bottleneck of international goods traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
Government considers ruling on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the State Government referred to the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court concerning the prohibition of night air flights.
Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine from a legal point of view the ruling of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event where the construction of the northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport would be realized.
The authorization to land for 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the state government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air nuisance.
The coalition must have decided by 4 January whether it wants to appeal the ruling in cassation.
The opposition criticizes this delay and attempts to pressure the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel calls on the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which consisted of banning night flights, otherwise this will be condoned as a total breach of a given word.
It’s damn difficult to be allowed to keep his word, Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's accusations that the Land government is still trying to authorize night thefts by using "advocacy and rubble".
It takes time to conduct a precise legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a “fast first impression”.
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its faction's statements on the prohibition of night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. banks repay aid
The big American banks, greatly affected by the crisis, are breaking down their ties with the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed the Treasury of $45 billion (over 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp bailout plan.
U.S. television channel CNBC said in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers and the payment of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The remainder of the sum comes from the bank's cash registers, which are well-filled by the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, Managing Director of the Bank of America, expressed his appreciation to American taxpayers: the capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult time.
The banking institution had presumed its capabilities by buying investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup is also considering sourcing money from the financial markets in order to free itself from state control.
The U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase on Thursday, CNBC reported, citing banking circles.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley reimbursed the public funds they had benefited from.
Accelerated elections
Eventually everything went faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor Nikolaus Brender by the board of directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the nomination.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin-based editorial office of ZDF, was the big favorite.
However, the channel did not want to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there has also been a willingness not to further harm the ZDF steward Markus Schächter in case the proposal is not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter’s candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had expressed support for Brender's renewal and 7 others had voted against. Brender's impeachment by vote represented a cooking but foreseeable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to bring Brender back to his post.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, who organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief, citing the fact that the rate of listening to ZDF news broadcasts had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, shattering the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 public law experts who had interfered in the debate and who felt that Koch’s way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it wouldn't have helped.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romanesque languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rheinland-Palatinate radio station) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German national daily).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF, first of all in the news magazine "heute-journal" (today's newspaper).
From 1988 to 1990 he was deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bi-monthly newscast presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the editorial staff.
After Brender’s disgrace, as he had just been voted journalist of the year by Medium Magazin, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the board, Rhineland-Palatinate Minister-President Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF's Intergovernmental Treaty so that the steward's staff proposals could not be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck is not considering asking for the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF’s oversight committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had cleverly maneuvered with the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to fire Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political partisan in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of parties, Frey is ranked as a left-wing liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was reached that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the examinations: a single examination should make it possible to close the chosen study module.
In addition, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of exams between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also undertaken to organise more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master courses.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulations from one state to another.
Fewer exams
Since the start of the student protests last June, the state ministers of education and university rectors have constantly spoken the fashionable expression "studiability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to considerably reduce the number of certain exams: "Each module should normally be able to be completed by a single exam," reads a 30-page document on future admission to university degrees.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of exams, we should be able to stop slippages, which were significantly detrimental to studyability.
In addition, "studieability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background should be examined carefully to see if we can not avoid this feeling of stifling that we sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should “have the opportunity and space to enable and foster personal initiative.”
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "re-accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes were not overloaded and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only state that has agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise tutorial programmes and strengthen the educational guidance offices as well as the examination offices and the International Relations Department.
The Länder and universities are planning a budget of 10 million euros for this purpose.
In early 2010, the government wanted to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one exam will be required to complete his studies.
The organisation of studies will need to be more flexible, it will also be possible to guarantee the recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions and access to the Master's degree will need to be simplified.
By the end of next year, the studyability of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the question of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but criticism was heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he wished that the organization of education policy would no longer take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned people should be able to express themselves a bit.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of the students is very useful to us", she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, member of the steering committee of the GEW, also asks that the Länder assure today's Bachelor students that there will be enough places tomorrow for Master's studies and as good study conditions as possible.
The Länder therefore need to hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that a work of the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in fragments of disturbing phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who gained freedom but lost at the same time his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently a director of collection in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted Chair of Poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm Artist's House in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged in front of fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received the German Language Award in 1989 jointly with some of the participants.
The enrolment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, “so someone who has not been able to resist the bullying trials of the Securitate sufficiently”.
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize honor for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary untangles with the power mechanisms of the dictatorship, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that clearly shows the abysses and lowliness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own file Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He was able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident from his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for Securitate spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims would have made speculations and sometimes guessed which real names were hidden last the names of borrowings Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confusing.
A systematic clarification has been constantly thwarted and braked in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a National Council corresponding to the Birthler Institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has rather dragged since.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
The fact that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very large is confirmed by the interview of a former official of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she had only been questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inevitable questions are associated with the Söllner case as so often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been robbed? Söllner's thoughtful response to the question suggests that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults in the Champions League
It felt like a representative was arriving there, pulled with four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sportswear manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross climbed at midnight less than a quarter in a Mercedes C-class, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, allowed himself to be driven into the city which was still a stranger to him.
Otherwise our fifty-year-old could have driven himself – he hadn’t been drunk, nor was he drunk with happiness.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
Because it's now that it's about to start.
The words of the Swiss that we had just hired three days earlier were clear: “We reached the eighth final well”, that is in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania “but we must not be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back”.
The “big job” awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is a matter of repeating the results of the Champions League in Mainz on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that reappeared after the three expeditious goals of Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Category: Draws
The eighth Champions League final (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/match return 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant inauguration of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only in the one who had brought luck, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "piper of souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good but that was no longer working with the healer Babbel.
As Jens Lehmann, a Babbel supporter, said, “In football when there is a new impulse, things happen sometimes that you would never have thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" seen by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It's someone who takes action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
But Babbel apparently missed it.
VfB Stuttgart have not yet crossed the course, warned manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defence of Romanian guests.
They had also won at Glasgow before having a bad revival four days later at Leverkusen with the 0:4, Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, said that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
The fact that Heldt has no heart to party on his 40th birthday, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the weekend events that a televised interview with goaltender Jens Lehmann bounced right before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered, in response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the management of style weakness and said she had decided to change coach under pressure from pubertal fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after the matches was removed.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked with pure selfishness” pushed Heldt down and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life these two forty-year-olds.
In any cast, they agreed on everything else, that is, without the previous work of the group by the coach replaced, strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “a big part in the success” replied Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Heavyweight Championships
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko verbally and gestually.
But after twelve tough rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
At the unanimity of the judges he imposed himself on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a points victory at the unaminous judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has defended his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional fights, had to confess twice his loss due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his counter-left.
Johnson, an eleven-centimeter smaller player who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing into play his dangerous counter-right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having overtaken the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him a "bad zombie" who "is not really capable".
During Friday’s weighing, the champion couldn’t help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose “so he could see his eyes.”
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko has won again in his fourth match since his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt which he had previously had to abandon without combat.
This year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a hit in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said, explaining his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was scheduled to take place in September.
It seems that his promotional company is now planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defense Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affair.
The SPD and the Left parties ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a misconception" about the deadly strike of two tankers last September, said the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of the news channel ARD "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 8 p.m.).
In short, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report at NATO's disposal, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the aim of the raid was in reality not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the U.S. airstrike that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast are of the opinion that Ms Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted slaughter strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government and whether the Chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejected these criticisms.
The chancellery has in no way influenced the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were getting louder and louder to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to information from the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg regarding the attack on the tanker trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they allegedly concealed the existence of the NATO report and hid some annoying details from the Minister.
The entourage of the two senior officials, however, suggests that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert has meanwhile requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the Department declined to comment on the allegations and referred to the Federal Parliament Commission of Inquiry which was to be convened the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms, we can indulge unfettered in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, he who awakens and experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, soon has the reputation in our Western world of being insane or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the effect of the drug.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes inspires the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best cases it is called visions, in the worst of folly.
But even if the trigger and effect differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitters of the brain – primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – breaks down and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often manifest during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earthly force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between insanity and dreaming.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between insanity and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It’s autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
Its body is in two dimensions with screaming colors.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over it, it hovers at the edge of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him winged, grinning devil creatures, their mouths bleeding, showing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Shattering, nasty voices, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. tears two cables off his stereo, makes it a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the buckle around the neck.
He's jumping.
The loop is detached.
Let it be a lesson for you, the voices in a choir shout out to tear his eardrum off. "Go to a clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime; in psychiatric clinics this is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer tell the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitation, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Just like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies coming from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the CHU Heidelberg ( Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility of adjusting reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in your life.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brains do these kinds of cabriolets, is always a riddle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to temporarily lose perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the people involved have tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way the anomaly of the neural system occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Likewise, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains heat up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy very expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena for the past ten years: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "The unreal world in our heads".
Hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also an impressive number of many other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising to find that in some conditions even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that deal with sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admitted to having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to high school.
A normal girl, to be honest.
If there weren't the images and the voices.
During recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, speaks to him.
When she answers, her comrades look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn’t dream, she’s sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive his presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young friendly.
“Am I crazy?” she sometimes asks.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are usually frightening.
The visions are often heavy.
When she's in class, it happens that she can't take the class because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he's invisible to others and the teacher is obviously explaining equations on the board.
At night the apparitions are usually frightening.
When, in the darkness of her bedroom, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and far too late, she often cannot make the distinction if she is already awake or dreaming, if the images she sees, the grinning faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she cries to these creatures.
She doesn't tell her parents or friends about it, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her bachelor's degree last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with psychologist Kasten via the internet, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or has insufficient stimulation, the probability is great that they will have hallucinations after a certain period of time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough to make sure there's animation.
Sarah K., the only child, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she called Dad, since she was old enough to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between dreaming and hallucination.
In our overly conscientious world, unfortunately, we quickly tend to take imaginary experiments for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called onioid form of experience, a particular form of dream-awakened consciousness modification.
Dreamlike experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot distinguish from the dream even when he is awake.
The state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully aware, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that undermines his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dreaming and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, an organizational capacity that is given to us men, so as not to sink into the void of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his dreamlike experiences in his book "Change of heart" as a soul-saving action.
He is 49 years old, at the time when his conscious goes on a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; in the meantime, his body is doomed to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from scratch, visits foreign places, travels back in time. He sees himself as an old man sleeping in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside looking after his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages among nobles who made blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a motorcycle Greek who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the Snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He is completely absorbed into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes, describing what he has experienced.
Contrary to dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience makes the horizon of our other daily experiences burst, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, dream-like delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even when awake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over from the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at age 27 and are firmly committed to joining the company, Hubert Burda, 69, told the Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then arise.
We will also have to see if they are capable of it.
You cannot impose your children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the position of Chairman and CEO as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he was responsible for the Treasury sector, that is to say, he was responsible for the capital of the company and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure he also took over the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus, for the first time, it is not a member of the family who is at the head of Burda editions.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old respectively, his son Felix, who would now be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda says the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in families who have been driven by a bulimia of capital, who have made enormous unfortunate speculation thinking that they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I have never dreamed of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely don't see myself in the role of the country's teacher as Springer could be and I don't intend to be part of those international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on much too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective that seems to have set itself El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the commercial center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, is home to prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food ray, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds of tea.
Among other things, Spaxion offers you to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, these are 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where we can benefit from the most innovative face, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of the customers, offering them an entirely personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included) are enough to get all the muscles of the body to work.
And, if after having our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the slogans of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various décolletés
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, endow themselves with electric car
The electrical company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, has created the “Official LIVE”.
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Official LIVE" (Logistics for the Implantation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric car in the city and will establish agreements regarding mobility, taking steps, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the deployment of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a set of complementary projects underway such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a future of tranquility” for the engine sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, foresaw "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish auto industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the Executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
“Through this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envision a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), devoted €800 million to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than €3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended for both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government demand support measures, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automobile companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a “significant increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of vintage cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Motor Show, a meeting place for professionals and motor enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Cristal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and vintage cars, but you will also find items of all kinds related to the world of the engine at ClassicAuto Madrid.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, complements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collection engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in the sale of automobiles, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sales and restoration of automobiles, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Exterior fitness test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include side activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Suitability tests with collector cars and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit outside the exhibition centre.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine shutdown and startup system, dubbed i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, is only available on the 150-horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has obtained as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behavior, mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which they all want to outperform.
Continuing with the passenger compartment, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large trunk with regular shapes.
The automatic stop and start system of the engine, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre 150-horsepower petrol engine and with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a real happiness. It is distinguished by its finesse, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most demanded Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not run a large number of kilometers a year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled fuel consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, that is to say the one that has the largest number of elements of series.
Among the standard equipment, the lane change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, as well as the outstanding 17 inches of roads are
In addition, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes, among other elements, adaptive bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly distinguished by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not run many kilometers a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version combined only with the gasoline 2.0 engine of 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which lies between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
“First” of luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as he was used to, had opted for a dark "lady".
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to look at his email, without offering even the possibility to see certain type of attachments or browse the Internet.
He enjoyed his five-minute fame in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone’s data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grand brother, but comes with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, around 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately search for a cafeteria on the Wi-Fi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly appealing and it has been working for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I'm concerned, I would need to have a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission’s repeated call to order to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe has barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside of the country of origin, we are reluctant to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals allowing them to profit their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no galery.
This is a connected device and you pay when you buy it, not every month.
And this is what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with lifetime access as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is arguably the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to take office in the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she chose the same to accompany her in the second moment, without a doubt, the most important of her life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
So at first glance, it seems that the first lady of the United States follows in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the taking of office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she wore a velvet printed in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium-heeled green shoes for the first time, and a similar but golden model, this time around.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised while she was wearing it the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for younger generation women who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Feducation and career of women in Spain", carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their professional careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether the woman works or not, and the type of job employed.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unsteady job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier, and have more children.
In contrast, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, postpone the entry into couples' lives and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after they settled in a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a fixed job needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to push back the union and arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exerted largely influences maternity, but less the date of commencement of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that increases the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child later.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who underwent elementary and higher education were first mothers at 25.1 and 32.1 years of age on average, respectively.
“There is also another distinction between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several of the brand’s products, insinuating the universal motto “Because I’m worth it”.
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, joins other celebrities registered with L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club so select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Best Model of the Year.
Ace Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de Aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographs" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition nucleus of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither fears nor illuminations.
Delightful pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
I leave you a few snapshots here.
In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same one I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.
About Samuel Beckett: “Nihilistic, allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his head, between helplessness and ignorance, with dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him.”
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best mountaineers are still and always caught."
William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and at other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collects the demented cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking posteriority with a violent discourse to the asticots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed, 'God beloved, I beg You to make me stop writing like a woman.'"
On his tomb were the worms of Spenser engraved: “Sleep after effort,/ after storm the harbor,/ rest after war,/ after life, tired death delights.”
On Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband normally accepted that she would tell her that Edward VII was spying on her among the Azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never have we seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent exceeded madness.
On Pío Baroja: “What did Martín-Santos do except to try to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What is Benet trying to do other than to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did this do except to aspire the glory of this man to serve as a pedestal for him?”
A Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking around our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a melancholy blood, saved from the SPA and weighing not more than six kilograms, and without saying a word, they gave her two kicks that left the dog grievous.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is amusing to assault for free a small helpless animal that, moreover, was on a leash.
We must add to this the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic that attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old man, or, ultimately, any person who is weaker than himself.
The episode took place at around 5 p.m., one Tuesday like the other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog groaned all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint with the district police station even though we doubt that it is of great use and to avoid touching the sensibilities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly assassins were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s going on with young people so they find it fun to mistreat a helpless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, helmet wear sets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, as it is the only protective element to prevent head injury, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond designing and manufacturing ever safer products” and said it was contributing to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new two-wheeled helmet promotion campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is “a constant concern” for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main goals is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles increase
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to figures from the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
However, the good news needs to be nuanced, since the reference for comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add all vehicles that fall into the light commercial vehicle category (derived from passenger cars, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
However, the large clouds that affect their demand the most have not dissipated: although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank credits, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of poor economic conditions must be added.
Given this situation and unlike passenger vehicles, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E was of little use.
In addition to individuals, freelancers and SMEs who want to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer can also benefit, but the number of transactions speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealership association predicts a similar year to 2010, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales of passenger vehicles and 4x4s.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory component on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a deficiency period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of its full strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in retaliation, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four disasters with injured people would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts the maximum force on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors Expands Plan for Opel to January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas, Zaragoza, were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it will need more time to complete the plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each point of the plan has been pre-approved by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, is postponed until early 2010.
In contrast, at GM, it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of Dutch sports car maker Skyper, backed by Russian group Converg, is gaining in importance.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest precious jewel, Porsche engineers started the Boxster S and managed to slim it down by just under 80 kilograms, leaving the scale to just 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual slack roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 15 kilos more less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos of lightweight, to mount 19 kilos of sports bags, and 12 kilos more.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms and replacing the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK box, the test was performed on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on roads in California’s secondary network in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behavior can only be described as irreproachable.
Reduced weight does not prevent the car from riding on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary, it has been a long time since we had tested such a small and lightweight model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in corners, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for the necessary time, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his motor again...
Thanks to its communicative and precise steering, the car will do what our hands say on the steering wheel.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the "sports" option or thanks to a system that modifies the engine roar, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is abrupt, whether it’s at a standstill or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road covering we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the poultry nests well.
The electronic assistants barely made a note of presence throughout the trip, while on some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-light car, the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
An intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer displays her bad girl face with as much containment as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or a "It Girl," it's a "Bag Girl."
Baskonia wins in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a vibrant victory at 91-82 on their visit to the hard terrain of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. She is thus at the head of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets with three points was the best of his team (29 rating).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, although it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, who took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of Vitoria's team were marked from the perimeter suggested that they had jumped on Israeli ground with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main craftsmen of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's indoor game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by cheers and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be noted as the best player in his team, with 13 points, although Splitter's "minus six" rating already suggested that this night would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria that we don't win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellows taking advantage over the luminous (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed to chain some skillful actions to take air, and it was at this time that the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic emerged which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas returned the counter to a reassuring score at the end (54-67).
The Avala team went out to play for everything in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they were not going to tire anyone from taking what they had earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis got closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the head of Group B of the Euroleague, in a game marked by the absences of players of Unicaja, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the scale of the rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The first-quarter game made the Andalusians dream: an aggressive defense and three three-point baskets in a row, two from leader Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the indoor game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to overturn the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both sides, as the injury exit of English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal mistakes weighed on Unicaja.
Indoor players and Lithuanian wingman Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the advantage 44-32, in the nineteenth minute.
An Impossible Rise
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, showed itself superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, causing the head of the group to shake.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was virtually impossible because Olympiacos were relentless when players pushed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the zone.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of listings for real estate, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The “How Much Should You Be Paid?” tool calculates users’ salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you need to register your profession, years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For the past week, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels poorly paid,” Trovit product manager Albert Ribera said in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross annually and a French, 31,059, while a Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least paid work in Spain is that of a server, with 11,592 euros net annually, followed by that of a seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet over the past three months are driver jobs, part-time jobs and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya’s departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president must abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his term.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He realizes that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he must search for another destination."
The channel also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as quickly as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile intended to impose on him by the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, uncertainty is emerging again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future by nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt by buying assets directly and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions can buy assets to be mobilized.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalized and, without questioning their non-compliant liquidity policy, are starting to put a bit of sand in the gears, as the ECB has done, with their auction one year later next week.
As a result, investors are doubting the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reductions.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are rising again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is once again a flight towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened a further downward revision of the Kingdom of Spain's qualification.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad enough to silence the defenders of moral risk, who were once again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those in charge of global economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of credit limitation on job destruction, while what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to regain their place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational if Ecofin saved Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allowed a euro area country to fail to meet its commitments.
What, on the other hand, makes sense is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and made its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are facing an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads increase to the extent of European corporate bonds, we do not have to worry.
If the European gaps were to shrink and ours continued to grow, then this would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote.Where our forecasting indicators require most research services to anticipate their recovery models and upgrade their 2011 forecasts, with the OECD and the European Commission returning to the burden with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not provide much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for now “caution is the mother of security”.
Connected Sectors
Iberdrola President Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to speak yesterday before the Congressional Subcommittee, where Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán outlined for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, eight-closed.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros by 2020 and 60,000 million more between that date and 2030, in case the nuclear power plants now in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investment would not amount to $60 billion but to $95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Starting in 2020, the issue will change, and it will have to increase the power.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, he considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, along with other “supportive energies”.
Galán, who believes that the government's newly approved Sustainable Economy Bill is in line with what his company is demanding, has not wanted to attack the Royal Decree to Encourage the Consumption of National Coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "on-time" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time to reach maturity and a stable paying framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, the economic terms of which have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance plans an investment of $20 million until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct research on energy efficiency on highways and at airports.
Acciona contests its first motorway in Australia at Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concessional highway in Australia, a market on which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site at stake is an estimated 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are rivals.
A five-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway concessionaire.
The city council wants to have it available by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia compete, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish firm in smooth, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest manufacturers, while the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's leading underground construction specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh public works company, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction projects and privatizations, but entering them is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and that still remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has just gained a place in this market with its 30% stake in Leighton owner Hochtief.
Millionaire assets
Acciona relies on a geographic area of the utmost importance for the sector, where it already has a broad presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind turbine fleet, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and heads the consortium of companies responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and leverage synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link (northern link), is expected to link the Toowong Western Highway to the peripheral track at Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel, the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place in the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open for traffic at the end of 2014, the construction is not expected to be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include twice two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute $500 million ($308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane is already offering jobs in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief widely fruitful, which yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The ACS-owned company will equip the national fiber broadband network infrastructure through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has sold the 27-story King George Tower in Brisbane, which has not yet started and Hochtief has completed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC gets awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after being commissioned to enlarge the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The construction is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore gets awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sr. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies who submitted to the tender organized by Renfe, including four finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Télécom 63 million euros for its anti-competitive conduct in the country’s Caribbean region.
According to that institution, the operator has restricted competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programs on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
An app store
On the other hand, the mobile telephone subsidiary of the French company has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an Internet application shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has earned 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona earned 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place among the clubs that pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
Indeed, the competition allocated €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served in this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, even though they lost in front of Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution (distribution)
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA's complex money-sharing procedure.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote $413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (among which Atlético de Madrid) received $2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (€800,000) and tie (€400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the final eighths receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarterfinals receive3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For example, in terms of fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, to which are devoted 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attracted seats.
The previous year's champion pockets 40% of the money assigned, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the offer to buy shares, by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public takeover bid (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be remunerated at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
Jerez’s group gives shareholders a 15-day deadline to indicate their interest in selling the securities.
The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues the restructuring of its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible offers of purchase and comes and goes judiciary of her former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the chairman of the group.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains overwhelmed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal further misappropriations of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) yesterday told the national hearing that they had been informed of the misappropriation of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes OPA exclusion of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday approved the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The Supervisory Authority explained that it authorized this transaction because it understood that its terms were in line with current standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory leaflet "sufficient" following the amendments applied on December 2.
The CNMV clarified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the share capital, composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized, and that they could not in any way be transferred before the finalization of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the norms in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of automobiles that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a lengthy and complex task.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Providers of claims assessment and maintenance services and solutions devote themselves to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Solera group, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and industry information development are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and list its price.
In addition, a “smart” graphic image of each model is created on which you can click on the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centres around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million annually to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most common application is for repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing breakage parts or to calculate a car's venal or residual value.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
With the products offered by Audatex, it’s easy to get an idea of what kind of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claim assessment solution for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, at most ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared wrecked.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious claims for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, failures or car maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and it generated a turnover of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began her process of internationalization, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2 percent more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed for $1 billion, today its shares are valued at a total of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Crashed Cars
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The goal of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimating and selling service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, breakers and professional vendors who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1,500 sellers and 4,000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collective cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Four-Stage Garage Quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in convincing older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, increases or discounts, then he can print the quote to hand it over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalog of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to see the inner face.
